So I definitely recommend finding some way to visit the island.\\n\\nBut I did not love the all day tour we took to go there and back, which I think was one of the typical boat tours leaving from the La Paz marina. We took a total of 6-7 hours from La Paz and back, and spent way too much time on the boat and way too little time snorkeling/swimming. Overall, we only saw a couple of turtles, birds, sea lions on the rocks, and a few fish. We did not swim with the sea lions (they were just sleeping), nor see dolphins, rays or any other exciting animal. Apart for the sea lion snorkeling stop, the tour consisted of a stop seeing some birds and pelicans, another to quickly view an arch, and then a 40-50 minute stop at a small beach to have lunch and swim for 10 minutes. Overall, we spent 5-6 hours on a boat and only 1-2 doing activities. I recommend you chose a tour company that makes this ratio better, either by having a faster boat or by leaving from Tecolote Beach instead of La Paz.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Isla Espiritu Santo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Playa el Tecolote", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "613953280": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Paradise!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d153205-Reviews-Isla_Espiritu_Santo-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "datePublished": "September 4, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Worth the day trip.

The crew brought umbrellas for us to sit under.. as it was the middle of the afternoon and extremely hot.

Our flight arrived very early at La Paz, Baja California Sur. We left our things at Hotel Catedral and went for a wonderful breakfast at DoceCuarenta, Casa de Caf\\u00e9. Hotel Catedral is three  blocks away from the beach, and is quite nice, clean, functional and its service is good. The first day we had a nice surprise called Whale\\u00b4s Museum. This place is in front of the seaside and there we could see enourmous skeletons of whales.  A video said that whales and hoppopotamus are far away cousins as evolution can say. And also in the Museum they had several other skeletons of whales, some big turtle shells and even a reproduction of several types of sharks. Yes, Baja California has been a place of whales since many years ago. Next day we drove to Balandra Beach, which is very calm and with a marvellous view. Fo rus the w\\u00e1ter in December was very cold, so we walked around the beach, enjoyed the sights, took a good sunbath and drove 10 minutes to El Tecolote Beach to have something to eat. Balandra Beach is a natural reserve so there are no constructions on the site. In El Tecolote I had three \\u201ctostadas de ceviche de pescado\\u201d that made happy my belly and gave me strenght to wait until dinner. The day was so relaxed, and the only important noise was the one of the strong waves of El Tecolote. Oh, in Balandara there was only complete delicious calmness that you could feel it when the sea was toching your feet. In the car we rented we drove to Todos Santos to take a look at Hotel California. We noticed that the Hotel is still there while its song is everywhere. The visit was nice. Next day we went to Isla Esp\\u00edritu Santo. You do not see it from the bay of La Paz, and on our way  had the company of several groups of dolphins. We were also lucky, because we saw three whales. Two of them showed us their tails and the other one only its back. When we arrived to the end of the island we saw the colony of sea lions. From afar we heard their noises. I do not know if all of them have some throat problem, but I am sure that the gutural sound they made came from that part of their body. Most of the people of the boat went swimming close to the sea lions. Before returning to La Paz the boat went to a small beach of Isla Esp\\u00edritu Santo that was very nice, even nicer than Balandra Beach.  In our last day in La Paz we drove south La Paz to Bah\\u00eda de Muertos also known as Bah\\u00eda de Sue\\u00f1os. A wonderful sight of the bay, and alos a place where fishing boats were coming and going. The not so good parto f it is that although the beach very nice and calm it is not good place for swimming because of the bunch of small rocks that is where the sea touches the sand. There again you could feel the calmness of the place with your feet when the sea tocuhed them. From Bah\\u00eda de Muertos we drove to Bah\\u00eda de Ventanas. Ah!, here the story is different. We were received by a huge feast of kitesurfers. The wind was blowing very hard and this made it posible to see too many kites in the sky next to the beach. I do not know, but may be there were more than one hundred kitesurfers of differnet colors in the sea at the same time and you could see how the  kites moved, sometimes softly and sometimes quickly, with the wind from one place to the other. I enjoyed very much my visit to La Paz and its sorroundings. Places to eat: La Paz and its sorroundings has very good and even wonderful places for having a lunch. DoceCuarenta Caf\\u00e9 turned out to be a first world class bakery. Then Bismark_sito in La Paz was also a good place for lunch. There I had two toasts (tostadas) of ceviche de pescado (fish ceviche) and a red snapper cooked in the frying pan. Here part of one side of the fish stick a little to the pan, but this detail did not spoil its softness and flavour. Then there were the toasts de ceviche de pescado at El Tecolotle. In Todos Santos we went to the restaurant called  El Sinaloense, and here I had a red snapper with a wonderful chili chipotle sauce that was not hot. I strongly recommend it. Well, the climax came in Bah\\u00eda Ventanas in a place called Las Palmas. There I had a garlic \\u201ccabrilla\\u201d fish. I think that this kind of local fish and the way they prepare it was outstanding. There I also had another fish ceviche that was also wonderful, but this one was in a cup and not in toasts. I can tell that I will go back to La Paz because I enjoyed the place and its surroundings very much and also because I want to go back to Bah\\u00eda Ventanas and have once again the \\u201ccabrilla\\u201d fish and also the fish ceviche they prepare there. After eating too much I know that I will have to wait 15 or more minutes to be able to move again, and thinking that in that momento I am like a big whale that came up to the sea surface for fresh air and then goes back into the the deep sea looking for more food.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Isla Espiritu Santo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Playa el Tecolote", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "551483392": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Fantastic Snorkeling, Some of The Best", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d153205-Reviews-Isla_Espiritu_Santo-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This place by far was some of the best snorkeling for sea lions and other aquatic life that I have experienced in the last 2 decades.

Note this is an all day trip, leaving the hotel around 7:30 a.m., and returning 12 hours later. I was a little apprehensive at first, because snorkeling with seals didn\\'t really sound very exciting, as I live in an area where we see seals all the time. But we were told it also included snorkeling elsewhere where we\\'d see fish and coral. \\nIt didn\\'t disappoint. It does take approx. 3 hours to get to La Paz, and although the only word utter by our driver was &quot;Banos&quot; approx. 45 minutes into our trip, we were in a small van with approx. 12 other people, so it was a pleasant enough drive visiting with other trip goers. Once at La Paz, you stop at the Sun Rider office to be fitted for snorkel fins and mask (we brought our own) and note it wasn\\'t mentioned when we booked this at the hotel, but there is a $5 per person fee to go out to the island. Our tour guide Sam was great, his buddy didn\\'t say much, not sure if there was a language issue, but Sam was great at explaining what we were seeing, etc. on the way out. Once out to where we were suppose to get in the water to snorkel with seals, the ocean was too rough, and we couldn\\'t go into the water. However we then went to the 2nd stop of the day, which was a beautiful cove (to ourselves!) everyone but my husband and I wanted to eat lunch first instead of jumping into this gorgeous crystal clear Sea of Cortez. My husband &amp; I snorkeled and we did see fish and coral, not a ton, but enough to impress. Once we got back to the boat, everyone had eaten any food provided, but that was fine, we weren\\'t\\' there to eat (we\\'re staying at an all-inclusive with all you can eat and drink) and we\\'d brought our own snacks and they had bottled water so no biggy. We actually stayed there for quite some time, which was very nice, most excursions give you like 20 minutes and you need to get back in the boat, we were there easily an hour and half. Then we headed to a different area that wasn\\'t so choppy and were able to get in the water to snorkel with the seals. Although there wasn\\'t as many seals, it was still very fun to actually swim with them. Once back at La Paz, on the way back to the hotel, our driver made a detour and we stopped at the Hotel California, (to use the banos of coarse) but also to see the hotel, which was an unexpected plus. I haven\\'t done a lot of excursions, only because we are usually very disappointed in them-too many people, not enough time, etc.,  but I would highly recommend this one. It went above and beyond what we were expecting. Anxious to go back to the Sea of Cortez.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Isla Espiritu Santo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Playa el Tecolote", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "544291394": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Go with Alonso Tours for this stunning experience!

The island it self has some wonderful opportunities to spend a few nights camping and walking around the island which is a magical place full of history. It is best to go with a guide who know the island well and he or she will be able to expanded the basic  local knowledge that you average boat may or may not have.If you are not going for a stay on the island be prepared for an all day trip which usually includes a picnic at Ensenada Grande after you have snorkeled with the sealions. If you want to dive make sure you go with one of the licensed operators as there are restrictions governing visiting the  area as it is a protected area and you will be obliged to pay a small fee to be able to go there. A wrist band should be issued to you by the operator which you should wear throughout your visit just in case the authorities decide to check your boat. For me it is one of the real jewels of a visit to La Paz and in spite of the regulation you will have a wonderful time either snorkelling or diving with the sealions. There are plenty of them and you are guaranteed to see and swim with them with out any problems. Just note that if you are planning a trip the colony is closed during the mating season of July and August when there is a danger of aggressive males being not too friendly to visitors who they see as a threat to their territory.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Isla Espiritu Santo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Playa el Tecolote", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "522708517": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful place, clear beaches, white sand.

Below are some of the most important guidelines to follow - these should be a part of your briefing before you get into the warer:\\n- the boat/ kayak should be anchored at least 30m from the island\\n- do not climb the rocks \\n- do not aproach the rocks closer than 5m\\n- when you snorkel with the sea lions stay pasive, don\\'t make unexpected movements, let the sea lions see you and record your presence\\n- don\\'t chase the animals to take the perfect picture, instead let them come to you\\n- aviod making loud noises or using strong light\\n- be wary of the alfa males as they can be very territorial in the mating season\\n- young sea lions can be very playful - they may come to you and try to catch your fin or your hand with their mouth like puppies do. This may cause some scratches - when they try to grab your hand, tight your fists so thet your fingers don\\'t stick out and stay calm - they are only playing \\n- when an adult sea lion comes to you and makes some air bubbles into your face it is a warning sign to step out\\nHope you will find these tips helpful.

If it weren\\'t for swimming with the sea lions, I\\'d have given it one star. My friend and I booked a trip from the malec\\u00f3n for 750 pesos each, or roughly $41. I don\\'t know that the $200 tours are any better (in my experience, they are nothing but tourist traps), as all boats out there seemed to have the same itinerary. \\nHere are my thoughts:\\n\\nPROs:\\n- Lunch was served on a beach with fresh ceviche.\\n- While swimming with the seals and sea lions, my group swam away and I stayed. A seal began to play with me, swimming around me and under me sideways so he could look at me. Then he played &quot;chicken&quot; with me a few times by swimming straight at me then diving down at the very last moment, inches from my mask. Then he barked at me and swam away. \\nThat experience was better than the $250 I paid in Cancun to swim with the whale sharks with a million other boats of people out there. \\n\\nCONs:\\n- We spent 8 hours on this trip, only 1.5 hours of which was off that dang, crowded, uncomfortable boat. They packed 14 people into a boat made for 10, and the bench seats were too hard to spend 6.5 hrs sitting on them. \\n- It\\'s 1.5 hours to get to the island, and then you spend another hour looking at birds and rock formations (yawn) before spending 30 minutes swimming near the sea lions. Then a 40 minute stop for lunch on a tiny beach without chairs or restrooms, then the long boatride back. \\n- Normally, the trip is about 6 hours, but an extra 2 hrs was added to our trip since we stopped at Tecolote Beach (an hour away) to pick up, then drop off a family. That made the trip excruciatingly long. \\n- It is windy on the open sea and the water at the sea lion location was very cold. Despite the hot July weather, 30 min of swimming there was enough to deliver a nasty cold the rest of the week.  \\n- The water was very murky and other than a few fish, there wasn\\'t anything to see while &quot;snorkeling&quot; (other than the sea lions we were to observe from a 15ft distance). Soon other boats showed up, and then it was a sea of fins. People\\'s, not fishes\\'.  \\n- There weren\\'t enough fins supplied, so I swam without.\\n- My mask didn\\'t seal properly and fogged up. \\n- The captain DID supply us with a steady stream of smoke from his cigarettes, though. \\n- There\\'s no actual &quot;island&quot; to explore. There\\'s a rock island inhabited by seals that you swim near, but that\\'s it. \\n\\nIn sum, I was disappointed by this tour and recommend you spend an extra hour to drive north and then head out to Jacques Cousteau Island or drive south to the reserve. Unless you\\'ve never been snorkeling before and love long boat rides, I\\'d skip this one. \\n\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Isla Espiritu Santo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Playa el Tecolote", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "394853157": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Amazing experience!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d153205-Reviews-Isla_Espiritu_Santo-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "You will falll in love with nature after your visit, even if you are resident of Baja, visit and discover the wonders of the underwater world.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Isla Espiritu Santo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Playa el Tecolote", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "394338413": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A once in a lifetime experience", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d153205-Reviews-Isla_Espiritu_Santo-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Sometimes we need mother nature to give us some inspiration to keep up with our lifes.

We were a group of 9 and ended up renting a small boat from La Paz. The trip across is super pleasant even for those prone to seasickness (if weather cooperates, as it did for us. We heard sometimes you cannot do it because of high winds). The island is a magical place. An amazing meld of the perfect desert landscape and South Pacific idyllic beaches. In one bay, we walked in chest-high water for about 300 meters of crystalline water to reach a completely deserted beach. Not a soul to be seen or heard around. Amazing experience. Very strange to reconcile the absolute lack of fresh water on the cliffs and the gorgeous beach below. Somehow you can imagine one or the other but not both. There are rumors of cave paintings in some of the cliff caves, but hard to tell if it is real or just myth. We did go to the ruins of an old pearl oyster farming encampment, which has deteriorated to frigate bird colony and small enclosed salt water lagoon.

After a while, he couldn\\'t catch his breath and wasn\\'t able to swim further.  I could hear gurgling in his lungs and was very concerned.

At my insistence he swam to another boat and got them to pick us up.  After all of this, their attitude as a reluctance to throw away the snorkel!

The swim also included a snorkling swim through a cut in the rocks to the other side and the fish life is the most colourful and varied that I have ever seen. The rocks there make a perfect untouched habitat for the creatures that live there. The Sea Lion colony is about 400 strong and is also a permanent home and breeding spot. It\\'s great to see the Bulls fussing over the cows and pups. Very familial. Have no fear and enjoy what Jauque Coustue calls the aquarium of the world. The trip back included lunch on an isolated, pristine beach in a bay surrounded by high rock cliffs. The water is clear and tranquil. On the way back back we saw Rays jumping and even saw a Blue Whale mother with a calf. Amazing! I wish I could live there.\\nOur skipper and guide are both named Sergio so ask for team Sergio if you book a trip.

The tour I had originally in mind would not make up their minds if they were going to make the tour that day so i wasn\\'t going to make another trip from cabos (I had a rental and drove myself everywhere) the prior day the port was closed so they canceled my reservation.... well looked around for another option and as soon as i walked out their shop surely enough another tour guy was waiting for us lol.... \\n\\nwell now to the action.... we got on the small boat and departed to the island.... roughly 40 min trip on sea to the island... so if you get sea sick easily well just take it easy and close your eyes... lol \\n\\nonce there the tour guy which by the way was very serious at the begining, started making conversation, and showed us @ the island and the many figures the rocks formed and every detail of what made the island so special, in one of the beaches (they are a few)  there was a rock formation man made rock formation bout 500 ft long, on the water, and he started telling us about the fact that Pearls were very common there back in the day... and that of course, like many natural resources man exploited the place, but well your tourist buide can tell you the whole story....  Queen Elizabeth I and many other important people wore these beautiful pearls. many stories he had for us... \\n\\nnow we get to the sealions... which is pretty much the hype of the tours since you do get to snorkel with them or sorounded by them... its scary i guess if your not to use to it or not really atracted by the fact that you will be sorounded by mamals 3 or 4 times your weight...  in their own habitat... but after all you\\'ll get the gut to jump of the boat and start sknorkling..... trust me this will be fun so enjoy it at your fullest.... we snorkeled for about 1 hour and we saw plenty of them all sizes came really close to them... and well it was  a whole bunch of fun...... btw the snorkling equipment was provided by the tour.  all in all great experience....  there is more activities we did but well ill let you find out when you go... \\n\\nall in all it was awesome it is well preserved, many regulations that keep the place beautiful, and awesome for us tourist.... and well without a doubt we will be headed back.

Let me start by stating that this was by far the highlight of our trip to Los Cabos. If you want to experience a National Geographic type moment, this tour if for you. The tour is basically an all day event. Our tour guide, Jose Hernandez, picked us up at our hotel in Los Cabos at 6:00 AM. From there we were off to a very good local breakfast on our way to La Paz, BCS. \\n\\nThe tour itself starts with a 25 minute boat ride to the island. Jose pointed out various geological and wildlife points of interest along the island. Next stop was a snorkeling session with sea lions in their natural habitat. I can not find the words to explain how incredible this is. This area also has a very nice coral reef with abundant sea life. Jose and the rest of the Cabo Expeditions staff (in total there were 3 plus two drivers for a group of 13) explained various details regarding the sea lion colony. The staff was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions. They were also very helpful in guiding the team safely along the colony as well as always ready to help take a picture or any other matter. \\n\\nFrom there we were off to a deserted beach. Nothing there but sand and another coral reef. The experience of having lunch in such a secluded place was awesome. And the sea water in that cove was like being in a huge swimming pool. The colors went from blues to greens to simply transparent. I have been to various beaches in the Caribbean (starting with Cancun) and the snorkeling experience here is second to none. \\n\\nJose took us out to explore the reef were we saw pufferfish (at least two kinds), starfish and various other critters. From there we took the boat back to La Paz and were driven back to our hotel in Los Cabos. In all a great experience. You can tell Jose and his staff love what they do and this is clearly reflected in the quality of the tour you are paying for.\\n\\nGracias se\\u00f1ores por tan incre\\u00edble experiencia y espero pronto volver a tener la dicha de tener otra excursi\\u00f3n con ustedes!

We saw a very large blue whale close up...right next to our boat, swimming alongside us.  It was an incredible experience!  This is not a part of the usual tour, but a very exciting extra.

The scenery was amazing (desert cliffs and cacti, similar to what you may see in the mountains near Tucson, AZ) ending in the sea. The sea lions were playful, interactive and entirely unafraid of humans. The reefs were beautiful and we got to swim within countless schools of many types of fish. However, remember is that Baja is NOT equatorial/tropical hot, like, let\\'s say, Costa Rica. The air is dry, and the water is rather cool (68 degrees F in early January). The boat ride from La Paz to the island takes a little over an hour. The water and rock formations are amazing to see. To enjoy the ride, wear a sweatshirt, sweatpants and a windbreaker. I stayed in the water for a few hours of the day. To interact with the sea lions and really absorb the environment you are in, you need to &quot;hang out&quot; in the water for a while. To do this, wear a WELL-FITTING full wetsuit. (My wife ended up with one that was much too big, and she could only stay in the water for a few minutes before being rendered painfully cold). I wore my own 3mm wetsuit that I own for triathlons back home and lasted all day. Wear a bibbed neoprene hood. Some people wore two wetsuits (a 3mm and a 5mm) and they felt great. The guide company will provide all this stuff (you do not need to bring it), but you need to ask them for it. I learned all this by a combo of luck (I happen to remember from previous Baja trips in winter that the temps were cooler than I expected) and from a very experienced scuba diver we shared our day trip with. Overdress, rather than underdress, and go for it.

This is especially fortunate due to its close proximity to its sprawling neighbors to the south, the Cabos and the East Cape.  Yet Espiritu is so easily accessible and affordable, it is a wonder that relatively few people visit.\\n\\nPerhaps most people who visit book a tour far in advance.  I would advise against that during the windy months until after March 15.  There is no point in visiting Espiritu when the wind is blowing.   During the winter, I would recommend your plan stay in Baja Sur to be longer than the time you plan to kayak Espiritu.  Then adjust your trip plan according to the weather forecast, say mountain biking, hot springs or kiteboarding in Los Barrilles during the windy period.\\n\\nSome people also try to combine whale watching with kayaking.  The whale watching season ends early in La Paz, so people book kayaking in the winter.  Not a good plan because of the wind.   Book your trip later.   You still might be able to combine whale watching if you go up to San Ignacio, where the whale season ends later.\\n\\nWe booked our flight to San Jose del Cabo on miles and the ecobajatours shuttle to la paz.  Just days before the flight, the weather report was for no wind, so I reserved a tandem kayak from Mar y Aventura and their co-located hotel Pasada Luna Sol.   When we arrived in La Paz, I noticed that the bus was going to go right past the hotel, so I asked the bus driver to drop us off and he did! \\n\\nThe next day we firmed up the arrangements to visit the island with Belen at Mar y Aventuras.   Their motor boat would shuttle us out to the island, stopping at the seal colony first for a swim with the seals.  We would spend 4 days and three nights camping.  Then they would pick us up again at our last campsite.\\n\\nDie hard kayakers can paddle to and from the island, but this is potentially dangerous if the wind is blowing.  It still requires a land shuttle to Tecolote, the beach closest to Espiritu.  \\n\\nThe rest of our first morning in La Paz was spent shopping.   In particular, we wanted to buy a coleman 1lb propane canister.  We walked to the Chedraui, but they didn\\'t have it.  Just a little further, there is a Mega, and they had it.  We bought the rest of our groceries there as well.  There is a bus stop right outside, and costs 10 pesos, and brought us back to our hotel.\\n\\nWe brought all of our camping gearing with us, including tent, air mattress and camp stove.  We rented a potty, kayak, pfds, paddles, snorkeling fins, and dry bags from Mar y Aventuras.\\n\\nWe camped at Candelara the first night.  This is shared by outfitters, including Mar y Aventuras.  There is a nice campsite on the beach just north of the outfitters.  It has a very nice tree.  Negatives are algae on the shore and the proximity to the outfitters. We stayed at Candelara the first night because there is a hike there up the arroyo.  We also were able to buy some fish from the the fisherman camp on the north side of Espiritu.\\n\\nThe next two nights we spent in Coralito.  There is a fisherman\\'s camp here as well on the north side of the bay.  We camped on the rocky south side of the bay.  This bay has great snorkeling on both sides of the bay.\\n\\nThe next day we spent exploring the large bay to the south, Gabriel.  This is an expansive beach, quite beautiful, with a bird nesting colony on the south side.  The north side has excellent snorkeling.  There is also a long hike there to the east side of the island.\\n\\nThis bay would also make a great camp, but it is too shallow to be reached by motor boat.  I would avoid camping in most of he area between Candelara and Coralito due to non-biting gnats from the little islands in the area.  One nice camping spot instead of Candelara would be Mangelcito, the tiny bay just to the south.  It has a rocky but very protected camping spot on the south shore.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Isla Espiritu Santo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Playa el Tecolote", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "154541821": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Visit the seals and make memories!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d153205-Reviews-Isla_Espiritu_Santo-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Get in the boat in Tecalote and hang on for a great boat ride to the Seal Island at the northern tip....swim with the seals, eat lunch at a wonderful empty white sand beach and head home for a nap to recover from a wonderful day that you will always remember!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Isla Espiritu Santo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Playa el Tecolote", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "154462765": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Swim with the seals!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d153205-Reviews-Isla_Espiritu_Santo-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "What can I say, the previous reviews have been right on.

We booked this tour through Olympus Tours in the RIU Santa Fe. We had told Adolpho through Olympus Tours that I was 14 weeks post op from having my pelvis broken in 3 places to correct hip dysplasia. We specifically said no activity that was jarring no bumping up and down. We were told no problem amigo (yes he spoke English well). We were told that this would be a 12 hour trip and there would be snorkeling and plenty to see. We were picked up by a wonderful English speaking driver who drove us the 2 hours to the town of Pichilinge. We were asked what our shoe sizes were and got fins as well as life jackets. We boarded a very small fiberglass boat that was covered with a canvas canopy. By the time we got there it was almost 12 noon. The waters in the Sea of Cortez looked extremely choppy. We were never told that the boat was going to be the size that it was. Even our driver firmly questioned us if were had been given all the glory details of the this tour, which we were not. \\n\\nOur boat was piloted by a young man who could not have been more than in his late teens to early 20\\'s. At one point the conditions were so rough that an older man whom was the actual guide had to take over because of the wave conditions. The wind was very strong. The boat ride was quite scary at times. The bottom of the boat kept smacking the waves with a violent force. We were never told to take motion sickness medications before the trip. This is not our first boat trip as we are avid cruisers and have been on small boats so we were prepared. There were 5 other participants on this trip. A couple from Venezuela with a 2 year old child as well as another couple who where enjoying &quot;life off the grid.&quot; Our guide did not speak English and he always talked to the family from Venezuela never looking at the English speaking people. If we were lucky they would translate for us what the guide said. We were not given a map of the area we were traveling. We did not know where we were going or what we would see. After about an hour or so we arrived at our first worthy stop. It was a foul smelling group of birds siting on mangroves. We lingered there about 2 minutes. We did not see any whale sharks, though we were told they were in season. I believe the reason we did not see any was because of the harsh surface conditions. We then visited Baja Camp. This camp is only open a few months through September. Our non English speaking guide starts trekking up to a rocky side of a cliff. We were told that sandals were all that we needed to bring as far as foot wear. I was unable to climb with the others. The terrain was wet, sandy and rocky. Yet our guide was barefoot.\\n\\nThe next stop was sea lion mountain. We were not told that the same place the sea lions were was where we would be snorkeling.  Everyone was ushered out of the boat. I could not use the flippers because that would have caused too much resistance on my hip, so my husband and I hung out on the &quot;life line&quot; behind the boat. The couple from Venezuela told us that the guide told everyone not to get too close to the sea lions. Too me the people who where snorkeling were too close to the sea lions. There we\\'re several large bulls grunting and could have been asserted their dominance over anyone in the water. I was also stung my several jelly fish and I was told not to worry they are very small. We stayed there too long. Our next stop was another small island beach where we were served ceviche and were given the option of making a ham and cheese sandwich. After a snack which I did not really partake it we were allowed to play in the shallow clear waters for about 30 minutes before heading back. We just wanted this trip from hell to be over. Please don\\'t waste your money or time on this trip.

We only had a couple of days before our timeshare week in Cabo, and my wife and 17-year-old son and I flew into La Paz.  Having flown over the Sea of Cortez many times we imagined exploring some of the deserted islands and beaches we saw, and this time we decided we would do just that.  I found Fun Baja (funbaja.com) after a little looking around, and they offered a 2-day &quot;mini-safari.&quot;  The communications with Chabelo and Naho in the office via email was prompt and detailed, and since the island camp was mostly occupied by one group, the three of us essentially ended up with a private tour guide and boat driver.  Juan, the guide, was knowledgeable and incredibly enthusiastic - he really loves his job and has just as much fun as the guests.  Edcardo, our boat captain, was able to take us to wherever the whales or dolphins were, and was always careful to drive the boat in a way to minimize bouncing or rolling.  We headed out of La Paz and visited several sea bird rookeries along the way.  We spotted a young whale shark (the season was pretty much over, so this was a find), and jumped in to swim along with him.  We were able to see the other island camps run by the other companies, and Fun Baja has by far the most beautiful location - an emerald-green protected cove ringed by spectacular rocks.  They had spacious tents set up for us with cots and clean sleeping bags, sheets, pillows, and towels.  The bathroom facilities were rustic, but were clean and green (they are like boat toilets and the pump out tanks go back to La Paz).  There was another group there with about 10 tents who we barely encountered, since they were out and about most of the time, and everyone goes to sleep worn out anyway.  Fun Baja has a meal tent and kitchen set up and provided hot lunches and dinners, beer &amp; other adult beverages, soft drinks, etc.  We enjoyed freshly-caught fish tacos and beef fajitas.  They brought along pineapple, snacks and drinks on the boat as well.  The beach was amazing and you could wade out well into the cove.  They have kayaks and stand-up paddle boards, and there are several great hikes through the rocky interior.  You pretty much let them know what you enjoy and they\\'ll make it work for you. A quick boat ride away is a rocky outcropping where the sea lions hang out, and we went snorkeling there under Juan\\'s watchful eye (he\\'s a scuba instructor so we felt very secure following his lead).  We paid a $10 extra fee each for wetsuits before we left, but it was a good idea in early April.  We interacted with sea lions (the baby ones are very playful, although their parents will rein them in if they are too rambunctious) - they\\'ll let you touch them and they\\'ll playfully bite at your arms or hand (softly though).  There\\'s a cool sea-cave, an arch you can swim through to the other side of the rocks, and a wonderful coral reef with all kinds of sea stars and other fish.  We also visited another cove where black pearls were once farmed (it was apparently the world capital for pearls at one time), but now it is a sanctuary with very little sign of previous habitation.  A hike across the island revealed the cliffs of the seaward side, and the mangrove swamp was beautiful.  We also drove our boat through schools of dolphin that swam with us and jumped, then went in search of whales.  We ended up seeing four types of whales, some were just yards away from the boat.  Edcardo would kill the engine and we\\'d be surrounded by the sounds of whales spouting.  For a spectacular camping adventure under the stars, four meals, drinks, snacks, swimming with the sea lions (twice), hiking (twice), kayaking, stand-up paddle, dolphins, whales, whale shark, and birds, we couldn\\'t believe how much adventure we got for our money.  This is not like those canned tourist adventures in Cabo - this is a real eco-adventure with people who really care about the environmental wonders they have in La Paz.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the real magic of Baja.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Isla Espiritu Santo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Playa el Tecolote", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "128431980": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful rock formations", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d153205-Reviews-Isla_Espiritu_Santo-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/ac/73/isla-espiritu-santo-club.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The island is most interesting with all of it\\'s creative rock formations and unique colors, alot of nice secluded beach areas to explore.

At night, you can walk and find a great restaurant, fun bar, or hopping night club. Lots of people, but not overly crowded. Feels very safe. On Saturday and Sunday evening, there were tons of street vendors (churros, fruit, corn, handmade quesadillas, pastries, etc). We happened to be there for Carnivalito so there was a huge children\\'s parade, but we think most of the food vendors are probably there year-round (or most of it).

I was sweating the minute I started walking. I managed to make it all the way to the end and back, and then some, to my RV park about a mile away. The malacon itself isn\\'t anything like my fave, El Boradero, in Colombia, where there are a ton of trees and the beach is long and clean. The beach all along the malcon in La Paz has some kind of green plant that is swept up every day or two. It ruins the beaches. Throughout my walk, I could not find one stretch of beach that I would swim in. The fact that there are all kinds of boats at anchor off shore, make me wonder if that is what is contributing to the plant outbreak. I want to use the word that starts with an &quot;a&quot; but I can\\'t remember how to spell it. lol.\\n\\nAlthough there are sections of the malcon where there is shade, 90% of it is in direct sun. Because there is so much cement, it really kicks up the heat factor. Along with malcon there are several statues depicting various sea scenes, including a wonderful statue of Jacque Custeau. To walk the entire malacon it\\'s a good idea to bring a bottle of water, unless walking in the late afternoon/early evening, to stay hydrated.\\n\\nThere is a ton of construction going on across the way of the malacon, including a hotel and all kinds of other construction. Roughly 70% of the waterfront is under construction, and many of the streets leading to the malacon are closed to traffic.\\n\\nI have been told that the time to walk the walk the malacon is in the evening on Sundays, when everybody, both locals and tourists, walk it\\'s length.

The place exudes a laid back vibe which you won\\'t find closer to Los Cabos and is an easy 1 hour and 45 minute drive up the modern toll road. \\n\\nFood is great and everywhere along a picturesque Malec\\u00f3n which serves as the center of social life in the city.  Rent a bike and meander through the streets next to the ocean.  Stop and try a gelato or Cafe helado.  On weekends the Malecon hosts bands and events which attract masses for great people watching.  A visit to the small Catedral provides a quiet time for reflection.   Hire a lancha (boat) to take you to the meager, but interesting coral reef on Isla Esp\\u00edritu Santo.  It\\'s not the greatest snorkeling, but the colony of sea lions is an awesome spectacle.  \\n\\nOverall, La Paz isn\\'t for those looking for Spring break type revelry, but it\\'s provides a relaxing, inexpensive, and authentic Mexican alternative.

We were there early January and the Christmas lights were still up and wrapped around the palm trees...a festive sight in the warm evenings. I would have given it a five but for a couple reasons. The first being a piece of rebar that caused my friend to trip, break her arm, and separate her shoulder...a bit of an inconvenience. It was a small piece of rebar (1&quot;-2&quot;) that was sticking up but which had been painted over. Why not just cut it off at the ground? My friend is well aware of the tripping hazards around LaPaz, of which there are many, but this was unexpected because of it\\'s placement near one of the many ramps that allow for transition between grades. The other is the graffiti that has been sprayed along the lesser traveled section that connects the tourist area of LaPaz to the water park. That part of the Malecon winds through sort of an industrial area and past some hotels before it merges again with the water.

A bit to the south is Marina Palmira with a couple of restaurants and shops.  Coco\\'s has fresh coconut drinks and a large play area for the kids.  At the windmill there are a series of exercise machines for a do it your self work out - greatly in demand in the early morning, and late evenings.  There are a couple of small restaurants, coffee and juice options on the water side, with many very good sit down restaurants - very casual to fine dining on the opposite side.\\n\\nIn the center of the malecon is the kiosk. Several times a week you can see music, arts and crafts, perhaps a car show, dancing\\u2026. the options are endless.  Continuing south the Queens Pier is next with a new play area for the kids.  Conveniently located across the street from Fuente\\'s ice cream - the best in La Paz! \\nOf course if you\\'re walking at sunset, we have some of the best to view!\\n Continue your stroll south while enjoying a fresh ice cream cone.

We see a lady with a donkey, fresh clams just harvested for sale, tents with local art and trinkets. More families are out, music plays from live entertainers for the cruise ship people. We walked to the end of a long pier. An old man who is fishing hands me a piece of paper and asks me in Spanish if I can translate it. I know very little Spanish but I\\'m able to decipher that someone wrote his horoscope down for him in English.  He had no idea what it said and through my limited Spanish and playing of charades, I was able to communicate that it said he was kind, honest and trustworthy but sometimes indecisive. I wondered who wrote it and how long he had it crumpled in his pocket, waiting for someone to tell him what he already knew.\\n\\nNight time is different. If you like people watching, sit outside a club and order some Pacificos and fresh tacos. Watch the nightlife. Skirt length just past the butt cheeks with lots of glitter and high heels. Young crowd, more locals, lots of traffic, police keeping an eye on things and a very fun vibe day or night.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Malecon", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/38/65/c3/malecon.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "250075879": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Not like the Embarcadero in SF", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d152679-Reviews-Malecon-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/38/65/c3/malecon.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This place is a bit disappointing if you\\'re expecting a lot of restaurants and things to do.

I think the one in Guadalajara is much more impressive. However... take in account WHERE we are, and WHEN it was built, and then you could say it is impressive.We are a land locked peninsula and we are located 1,000 miles from civilization, now, and then. NOW we have a PAVED road all 1,000 miles, then, we had nothing. Now we have an international airport, and a major seaport. THEN, we had neither. So... taking in account everything except the stones that were used to build the church. Everything else in the church had to be hauled down the impassible baja california desert via mules, or across the sea of Cortz, the only two routes to La Paz then. So, I would say that in 1835  when construction began it was an impressive feat. Take also in account that the population at the time numbered 800 inhabitants, prisoners were used to help build it.

Went back over to our spot under the palapa and sun bathed for an hour or so. Around 11am or so it started to finally get busy. I decided to rent a kayak and we ended up buying 2 cups of fresh fruit from one of the vendors and kayaked over to the other beach directly to the south. It was great, we had our own private beach enjoyed our fruit and sunbathed some more. Ended up walking up and down both ends of our beach looking for shells and marine life. Found some beautiful fish, crabs, pelicans and even a anemone. Ended up staying a total of five hours or so. If you wanna avoid the crowds highly recommend driving up early and seeing everything you\\u2019d like to. Besides the kayaks they do have umbrellas and chairs available for rent and even paddle boards. We were there early enough that we experienced both high and low tide. During the low tide there were dozens of sand bars and I even walked out about 150 yards or so and water was barely up to my shins. Water is some of the clearest I\\u2019ve ever seen.

Heartily recommended.\\n\\nWe have been riding the public bus from the terminal on the Malecon (just across from the two story waterfront pavillion) near the whale museum. Ecobaja counter sells tickets...100 pesos roundtrip.The trip follows the coast through desert north of town and takes about 40 minutes, depending on locals getting on and off at various stops. First bus (the one you want to catch to avoid the crowds) is at 10 AM. Returns roughly every two hours, with last one early evening.\\n\\nThe early bus drops you at the public parking area by the beach, but because the road fills up, it picks you up several hundred meters up the road. Make sure you clarify with driver where pickup is!\\n\\nThere are two beach areas. The main beach where 90% of the people go has vendors and blue portable rental umbrellas (200 pesos per day-ish). About 99% of visitors we have run into are locals or from other parts of Mexico.  That may just be the season...not sure.\\n\\nThe best beach, though, is &quot;around the corner&quot; to the right when facing water, and requires either walking in shallow water around a point to see the cove, or a climb up and over the rocks to reachit. This beach is gorgeous and calm, and has only a fraction of the visitor load of the main beach area. This is also the area with the &quot;mushroom rock&quot;. We have only gone to the more secluded beach, and avoided the booming crowd that seems to gather each day at the main beach.\\n\\nNote: There are no bathrooms at either beach. Also, please, please, PLEASE pack out your trash.  We take an extra bag to carry out any trash we find...which hasn\\'t been much, but is heartbreaking to see.\\n\\nDespite temperatures of over 100 F each day we have been there, the water has been siper clear, cool and refreshing, and there have been very few (if any) biting insects. Wear reef walkers and/or shuffle your feet in water to avoid stingrays. Lots of small fish, some larger ones cruising through, all sand bottom and very shallow lagoon. The whole bay / cove has truly incredible colors of different aquamarine shades with the water right up to sand dunes with a desert backdrop and red / brown cliffs.\\n\\nReally, Balandra is one of our very favorite beaches ever, right up with any we have visited in the Agean islands in Greece,  Crete, Thailand, Bali, other parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.

Certain things to note that you don\\'t see in the US are military vehicles with large guns and men in military garb commonly driving by on the roads. They are common in the area, however, and most likely looking out for the safety of tourists.\\n\\nWe drove through a few &quot;deserted&quot; desert areas, some random desert homes, and eventually ended up in La Paz. (It is pretty much a straight shot on the freeway so you will not get lost.) La Paz was built up and rather quaint. It was the traditional beach town, complete with statues, a harbor, restaurants, markets, and most helpful was an information booth, which provided free brochures. (Balandra is about 45 minutes outside of La Paz.) We took the brochure and were off.\\n\\nThis Sea of Cortez treasure was like nothing I had ever experienced. I have been in some amazing locations and a few beaches stick out such as a tiny beach on the Caribbean Island of Carriacou which also had some shallow beaches, but they were not tucked away and protected such as this. They also were not shallow nearly as far out as Balandra Beach.\\n\\nIt was an extreme delight to not even need snorkeling gear.

Very fine and soft. \\n\\nThe water was placid and very shallow for several hundred feet. We could let the kids roam and explore without fear of waves or drop offs in the water. We rented a paddle board for $16/hour and tried that out. Was the PERFECT place to learn / self- teach paddle boarding! The water, due to the depth, was warm and inviting unlike the other areas of the Sea of Cortez which were still quite cold!! \\n\\nAs other posts have mentioned, there is little shade at Balandra. There are now approximately 10-12 palapas to escape the sun under. There are also overhangs from the cliffs where we found shade along with the very friendly locals. There are now a few vendors who sell food out of the back of their truck. A man was asking the locals if they wanted ceviche (he seemed like a delivery guy) but he didn\\u2019t ask us.

And the best part, at least for those who\\'d rather travel by foot than with a rental car, is that there IS a bus that goes here from La Paz\\'s Bus Terminal (Aguilar). From November to December, the bus for that route runs every 2 or so hours, and the last bus back to La Paz is at 5:45PM. For a round-trip ride, the cost is 100 pesos (5 USD), and the travel time is about an hour each way. I highly suggest taking an earlier bus to get the full glimpse of the beach in all its colorful splendor. Unfortunately for me, I only had enough time to take the 3:30PM bus, and I didn\\'t get there until around 4ish. The beach was still beautiful but it didn\\'t have the alluring blue color that I was hoping to see. It\\'s quite a sight to behold with the shallow beach stretching in every direction being wrapped in a mountainous embrace by hills that are adorned with green, spiny cacti. When planning a trip to La Paz, make sure you allot enough time for this beach as well as the Tecolote beach, which is a bit farther away. I only got to see Balandra but it\\'s still worth it.

If you want a relaxing, photo op beach....this is it.  \\n\\nIt was an all day trip for us.  We drove from San Jos\\u00e9 Del Cabo and it took about 2 to 3 hours to get there.  (We stopped on the way and had lunch.) There are two ways to get there from San Jos\\u00e9 Del Cabo. On the way there, we went the Hwy 1 route.  It\\'s mostly a two lane highway that goes through the mountains.  It was nice, but the steep turns/curves to get through the mountains became relentless.  If (when) you get stuck behind a slow truck or car, it\\'s really hard to get around it because there are very few long enough stretches to see if a car is coming from the other direction (and I\\'m not a timid driver).  On the way back, we decided not to re-live Hwy 1, so we took the route that is mainly Hwy 19 with a partial toll in Cabo (about 35-50 pesos).  It was less hectic and we even managed to get to our dinner reservations on time--which we thought wasn\\'t gonna happen.  \\n\\nWe used our iphone 7 to take a panoramic pic of the view and it was beautiful to send to friends and family at home or on social media.  (Ok, my 15 yr old daughter did it, but I used it. ;) )  The really nice thing about the water there is the fact that it\\'s about waist high deep.  You can walk out very far (maybe even to the opposite beach, I\\'m not sure) throughout the cove.  My daughter and her friend went paddle boarding and said it was super easy to rent the boards and loved it.  \\n\\nThere are snacks and drinks you can buy as well as umbrellas, tables, and chairs to rent.  (We rented an umbrella, one table, and four chairs for 250 pesos.)  I think we got the last umbrella, so be aware that it isn\\'t an endless supply.  (You will definitely need some sort of umbrella if the weather is nice, don\\'t think you won\\'t.)  \\n\\nThe beach had a lot of people on it, but not too many at all (at least the day we went on a Thursday).  We had plenty of room around us.\\n\\nIt\\'s considered one of the best beaches in the world. So, if you are near or even if it\\'s a bit of a drive to get there....go experience this beach.

Rented a double kayak for an hour from a local guy (had to give our ID which I wasn\\'t thrilled about but we got it back afterwards). Even offered to share our palapa with a local family that showed up later when all the palapas were gone - safe, fun and enjoyable. Had no problem leaving my stuff under the palapa while my husband and I swam. I saw some people came as part of a tour - so if you don\\'t have a rental car, you can do that. Plenty of parking and the usual people selling local wares. No one was pushy - a simple &quot;no gracias&quot; had them moving on.  The one guy you shouldn\\'t say &quot;no gracias&quot; to is the burrito guy. He came by the first time and I didn\\'t take him up on his offer of a burrito - but there isn\\'t any food out there so on the second visit I decided to give it a try.  $30 pesos for 2 - not your traditional American style burritos but smaller almost like a &quot;roll up&quot;.

However it did pick up a bit.  \\n\\nWater is beautiful and you can wade out for several hundred yards.  Unfortunately, something in the water (maybe a mite or something) decided that I was their snack.  My legs got very itchy and a rash broke out.    It only affected 3 of the 4 of our group.

To really take advantage of the Bay you need to be there early and if possible avoiding the weekend crowds. The best beaches are a walk and a swim across the far side of the bay away from the car park beach but be sure to do the stingray shuffle if you are walking across. There are sit on kayaks to be rented on the beach and that can be an excellent way of exploring the area and getting away from the crowds at weekends. There are few facilities there other than  a few sun shades, a mobile taco shop and the Kayak rental. The area is within a easy twenty minute drive from the city through some spectacular countryside and I would suggest that if you want to make a day of it either take your own picnic or go to Pichilingue where you will find two very good restaurants that specialise in seafood. Tecolote is further north with several more possibilities for eating but Tecolote is probably the most popular beach with the local population and it can get very crowded at week ends and summer evenings.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Balandra Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/20/f5/ce/the-most-beautiful-beach.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Callejon Puerto Pichilingue 7 km", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23010", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "381557330": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful shallow water bay outside La Paz", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d1067272-Reviews-Balandra_Beach-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/20/f5/ce/the-most-beautiful-beach.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A stunning bay and beach.

It took us about 2.5 hrs to arrive at our destination. The drive was fairly easy; however certain parts of the city streets were hard to navigate and we certainly would have gotten lost if we did not have a guide. The beach was amazing! You could go halfway out to the middle of the bay and the water was still only was high. The area does not have a lot of shade so bring umbrellas and a lot of sunscreen. There are a few public umbrellas that you can use but they get taken up fast. When we went, there were some guys there who setup umbrellas, tables and chairs. They rented to us (after some negotiations) for $16 for a set of umbrellas and chairs. Take a water proof camera to take some awesome pictues. Also take along food, water and snacks as areas to get food is sparse. The only place to get food was a bit expensive because he was the only peddler there.

Sadly, many of them are victims of their own beauty with scores of people visiting, many restaurants, businesses and people selling tacky items lining their shores. Such is not the case with Balandra. Balandra is a truly virgin beach with essentially no facilities. Perhaps that is why it has been able to keep its beauty. \\n\\nBalandra is a bit out of the way, about 40 minutes north of La Paz, the capital of the State of Baja California Sur. There are taxis that can get you there, but perhaps the best way to get to Balandra is by sea. You can rent a water taxi that can first take you to swim with the whale sharks - they are harmless and yes, you can get extremely close to them (you can touch, but they are shy and they dive deep if you get too close or touch). Then just cruise through the bay north towards Balandra. On the way, you will see a little light house that is now home to several sea lions, and finally reach the Balandra Beach. \\n\\nThere is in fact not just one beach, but several beaches around the Balandra Bay. As mentioned above, there are no facilities so these are truly virgin beaches. The water is very shallow and soft sand for a long while - this is both good and bad. It is great for little kids, though you do not get much swimming, rather wading. The sand is also good and band - it is of course soft, but because there are no rocks (except on the edges of the beach - more on this below), there are typically few or no fish. So much of the beach area is not good for snorkeling. However, as you get to the edges of the beaches, there are some rocky areas where you can find some decent (though not great) snorkeling.\\n\\nI should also mention an unusual rock formation on one of the Balandra beaches, the one locals refer to as the mushroom rock. The naming is well-justified, the rock looks like a mushroom, though a mushroom cloud is probably a better description. In the town, you will see pictures of this rock all over the place - this rock is a rock star in La Paz (pun intended). From the pictures, it appears that this rock is some huge, majestic, awe inspiring colossus. Yet, we you arrive there, the 5-feet rock greets you rather unceremoniously, a rather anti-climactic experience. Nevertheless, it makes some interesting photography subject,.\\n\\nOverall, this is a very enjoyable part of La Paz. It is perfect for romantic couples, as you will find lots of space to yourself (and, yes, we did see some couples, who - shall we say - got carried away with the romanticism mixed with  hormones, leading to you know what!). It is also great for families with small kids as the water is shallow and the sand is soft.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Balandra Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/20/f5/ce/the-most-beautiful-beach.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Callejon Puerto Pichilingue 7 km", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23010", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "250669811": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful like the pictures", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d1067272-Reviews-Balandra_Beach-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/20/f5/ce/the-most-beautiful-beach.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A bit chilly in January but exquisitely beautiful.

We had talked to a couple of people who made the trek to Balandra Beach and they loved it.  All of them said they made the mistake of going through La Paz and it took 45 minutes longer than bypassing La Paz.  \\n\\nWe got the bypass directions and took off with an ice chest full of drinks and food.  The highway to La Paz is great but as you enter the outskirts of La Paz, it is hard to tell if it is two or three lanes and cars seem to drive wherever they want.\\n\\nOnce we got to the beach, we found a nice parking lot and 14 palapas that are free to use. The water was amazingly clear and waist deep forever.  The sand is white so the palapa is important and so is sun screen.\\n\\nYou can walk a long, long ways out into the bay. The bottom is all sand so make sure you do the sting ray sand shuffle (shuffle your feet through the sand instead of stepping).  I surprised a sting ray without any sting.\\n\\nAs you walk into the beautiful water, you will see big yachts parked just off the bay.  \\n\\nIf you want a chair or lounge chair, you will  need to rent them. The is a small food trailer there with pretty good Ceviche.  Of course food is a little pricey.\\n\\nThis place is very pretty and the water is great for kids.

Making it to the last beach within the bay pretty much gives one their own private beach as very few people go out that far. There are palapas (palm thatched shade areas) on the first two beaches, but none on the third, though there is a great rock overhang as you enter that beach.\\nAt the end of the bay one can climb up the trail to the headlands for great views of Balandra and across the channel to Espiritu Santos Island (really a group of islands with Espiritu Santos being the largest) and across the Bay of La Paz. The point there is also a great place to snorkel, often with dozens of species and clouds of them.\\nBalandra Bay is also a Natural Protected Area and may soon be added to the list of World Heritage Bio-Reserves, as are the islands across from it and in fact all islands in the Gulf of California/Sea of Cortes now. \\nYou have to bring whatever you want with you as it is nature at it\\'s finest, but the next beach over (Tecalote) does have a few restaurants and various water sports toys, as well as trips to the Islands.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Balandra Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/20/f5/ce/the-most-beautiful-beach.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Callejon Puerto Pichilingue 7 km", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23010", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "181077490": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Our most favortie beach", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d1067272-Reviews-Balandra_Beach-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/20/f5/ce/the-most-beautiful-beach.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "It is not commercialized and hope it stays that way....We love to walk in the clear warm water all the way to the mushroom rock.

I was carefully watching were I stepped and admired the schools of fish near the rocks. However, I stepped on a hidden white sting ray, which was the color of the sand and got the shock of my life. It hurt like hell and bleed for about 15 minutes. Then it felt like by calf was paralized up to the knee. The advice by the local people was to soak your foot in warm salt water. This was easy to do as you can sit near shore and keep your foot in the water. I massaged my foot for about 2 hours to get the stiffness out and ease the pain.

I try to go at least once a month for that feeling of &quot;being away&quot; and in more Caribbean style waters than where I live on the Pacific side. This bay is gorgeous.....the rock formations meeting the sea make for some interesting snorkeling.  There are lots of little fish everywhere and I\\'ve seen tons of jumping fish as well.  The water is the clearest you can imagine (if it\\'s not too windy a day which stirs things up), and you can walk out really really far and the water will still be at your knees.  Great for kids......except for some caution....there are definitely seasons for jelly fish...which are invisible to us.  You might experience some tingling, slightly stingy feelings anywhere on your body while submerged in water....that would be jelly fish.  You also have to do the stingray shuffle as you walk out, so as not to surprise one of the little creatures blending in with the sand color.  And on my last trip there a couple of days ago, both my friend and I had a new experience there....we were both bitten or pinched by what seemed to be a crab claw..but not sure....as it disappeared back in the sand. The pain was excruciating and didn\\'t go away til about an hour passed. My toes swelled up and I saw 3 separate bumps where I got nabbed.   Do not put ice on it like I did....it made it worse.\\nThis beach has a lot of local support to save it from development.  It would be tragic to see this pristine habitat and environment become yet another mega resort or god knows what else.  It has remained one of the most untouched easily accessible beaches the public has enjoyed for so many years.  It\\'s charming that the ice cream guy pushes his cart through the turquoise waters....it\\'s charming that in the high season, there\\'s a guy selling cold fresh fruit in cups with hot sauce.  They just added some portapotties...but they are worse than finding a place in nature....disgusting condition and obviously not maintained.  I hope they take them away.\\n We usually bring chairs, beach blanket, ice chest full of drinks and lunches, and most of the time we get lucky and grab one of the scattered palapas to sit under.

We spent the better part of  month in Ja./Feb. Camped out on the east end of the beach, away from the restaurants.  The water is gin clear, the beach sand is soft  (several beaches we\\'ve visited in Baja have very abrasive, rough gravel).  We enjoyed our kayak almost daily, but you need to keep an eye on the weather, as winds can come up quickly from any direction . Great place for desert hikes, or follow the dirt rooads out to the end of the peninsula.  We didn\\'t go to the restaurants, not all that appealing....lots of boats to watch coming and going from La Paz. We had no security problems, other campers keep an eye out on your stuff if you leave.   Lots of spots to camp,, but NO facilities or nearby stores, so bring everything you want or need with you.

The staff then &quot;run&quot; any order you have over to the main restaurant bar just next door. So, be careful where you sit!\\n\\nMy affable, English-speaking &quot;waiter&quot;, Alejandro, (&quot;Alex who makes it happen&quot;) gave me a menu from next door, and told me I need to order  a minimum of 200 pesos )12 USD) in food and beverage----despite my 300 peso (18 USD) kayak rental! He then went next door and got us our fish tacos and sodas, totaling 220 pesos, more than enough, right? A minimum service order is legitimate at these beach clubs---but they are mostly reasonable---- satisfied with drinks or a food purchase.\\nAs we were paying the official bill, printed on the main restaurant\\'s receipt, Alejandro, told me in perfect English that I neeed to also pay him 200 pesos for sitting under the awning table! He explained this is an expensive location to do business and that I needed to satisfy BOTH 200 peso requirements. I protested, as this was new to me, but &quot;Alex who makes it happen&quot; insisted. This was an excessive fee, which, as I found out upon returning to La Paz, is not legitimate. It was simply what Alex could get from a tourist.\\nMy point? Do business for food and drink only at the main palapa restaurant.

The food sounded so amazing me had to check it out.

We sat at a table and studied the menu with our feet playing in the most softest buttery sand!! The menu is Spanish so.....it took us awhile. Service was kind of slow but very hospitable. \\n\\nOne thing the couple recommended was the margaritas made from fresh lime juice. Yes!!!! Order this. It\\'s not on the sweet side, it\\'s on the fresh squeezed lime juice side....and to us, it was delicious. \\n\\nSecond, ordered the shrimp ceviche. Huge portion. Add the sauce that is on the table. Muah!!! So good. He also gave us their fresh pico, we ate half of it with their crunchy tortilla chips (it was kind of spicy) and I ordered some avocados that I added to the rest with some squeeze of limes from our ceviche and WHALAH!!! Guacamole!!!! And it was divine.\\n\\nWe asked for the waiter\\'s recommendation because we didn\\'t know where the fresh grilled whole fish and grilled prawns were on the menu that the couple recommended. So we ended up getting the lobster with a cream sauce topped with mushrooms and tomatoes...my boyfriend sucked on the shells afterwards because it was that delicious. We laughed about that but we were on vacation and we were having fun!!! Memories.\\n\\nThis is a memorable place with excellent, fresh seafood. We will definitely come again the next time we stay in Cabo. It can be romantic and family oriented as well. \\n\\n***After lunch, we drove to Balandra Beach which is also a must!!!

They have a lot of smaller snakes and some large ones from other areas. They also have an enclosure with lots of birds including parrots, parakeets, California quail, etc. and a couple of rabbits. In that enclosure you have to move very slowly and carefully to avoid stepping on birds. They will come right up to you. You can get little cups of food to feed them (for no extra charge) and they flock to you. We watched one bird grab a little cup of food right out of a tiny girl\\'s hand and fly up to a perch where it could eat it by itself. \\n\\nThere was a pond full of turtles, close to 100 I think. We had little cups of food and threw in individual kibbles and watched them try to catch them or swim after them. Several of the turtles were basking on the rocks around the pond. They were all pretty good-sized, with shells probably in excess of 6 inches in diameter\\n\\nThere were a lot of lizards and a large alligator. The women\\'s restroom door was hard to close.

This animal sanctuary is not up to the standards most of us would expect.  The animals are rescued and cared for, but it would be nice if improvements could be made (lack of money?)  Those who run El Serpentario and the many volunteers really do care about these animals, though.\\n\\nWe first sat down in a little area to listen to our volunteer guide tell us about the El Serpentario and to show us some of their residents :-)\\nMost fascinating was the smallest lizard snake he showed us.  This little guy is under 2&quot; in length, translucent gray, and has two feet up front with tiny toes.  People from around the world come to see this little guy and take photos.  After the educational show and tell, we were able to roam about.\\n\\n  The Aviary is fun and for $1.00 donation, you get a little cap filled with bird food.  You walk in and the colorful parrots and parakeets/budgies flock to you...landing on your head, arms or wherever they can perch.  Be forewarned that there is at least one large Parrot that is the Alpha in that Aviary.  He/She scared off any birds that landed on me so that he could have all the food.  The other trick is that this large parrot will steal the cap from your hand!  So, make sure you have a good grip on that bird feed in the little cap or the bird flies off with it. (and yes they are that powerful to do it!). \\n\\n For the little ones, they will enjoy the bunnies that are kept in the entry of the aviary.  You can buy a bit of rabbit food if your or your child wants to feed them.    The other fun thing was seeing the yellow Burma Python (about 6 1/2-7 feet length) and being able to hold it!  The handler helped visitors to drape the snake around their neck and shoulders.  Beautiful and docile animal!  Lots of turtles, terrapin, a few tortoise, Iguanas, and snakes.  \\n\\nNot a large sanctuary. El Serpentario has a small gift shop (states prices in $, but it is actually pesos!  I got fooled thinking an item was $30 but really 17 pesos per dollar if you want to know what something really costs)  Restroom available..one for men and women.

Once there, he talked a lot about the mission of the sanctuary and the animals that were in residence. There is a good variety of reptiles and other creatures so the tour is perfect for the short amount of time we had in port. We had an opportunity to see some of the non-lethal varieties of reptiles up close and then went into the aviary where you could feed the birds. They were eager for the company and would eat from your hands and land on you. This facility can benefit from donations so I encourage you to contribute before you leave. They are doing good work and help allay the unreasoned fears of many people who have cultural biases against reptiles. The myths surrounding snakes are many and this group helps correct those misconceptions. You don\\'t have to like snakes, but you don\\'t have to fear them, either.

The other marina did not have a slip for us.  After looking at the other marina though, we decided that we liked Marina Cortez better because it was way more quiet in a less busy kind of way.  It is located right on the edge of town.  A walk to the other side of town on the malecon and back is a little over 3 miles round trip.  That makes for a nice morning walk! \\n\\nThe electricity and water are free with your dock fee.  The showers are located up in the main marina area, not too far.  They are decent but for a new marina like this, it seems to me they could have made them a little nicer.  \\n\\nThe marina personnel are very nice and helpful.  Laundry can be arranged at the marina desk.  They do not recommend the dock water for drinking.  They say it is not potable, however, the boats on either side of us use it for their tanks.  One of them adds chlorine and the other one just drinks it straight up.  They will arrange for delivery of water in 5 gallon bottles for a nominal fee per gallon. \\n\\nThere are three restaurants at the marina.  We haven\\'t eaten at any but they are always busy.  Two are outside and one of them is a sports bar.  \\n\\nThere is usually some kind of music being played at the restaurants or downtown which you can hear at night.  It\\'s been nice.  They do not play too late.  \\n\\nThere is a strong tide going in and out of the bay so if you can time your boat entry at slack tide, that\\'s probably best unless you like boating sideways.  \\n\\nWe\\'ve been doing some varnishing and it hasn\\'t seemed to bother anyone here.  \\n\\nThe only reason I did not give the marina five stars is because the lock on the gate is broken.  Instead of needing a pass card or key, there is a button on the inside of the gate which can be accessed from both sides of the gate.  Not high security.  There is a 24 hours security guard across the walkway from the gate but I think he could be easily distracted.  There are security guards that walk the docks.\\n\\nThe rates are decent as well.

Jean-Christophe and Marjorie were so welcoming!  They are genuinely nice people, and took the time to show us how they live.  Check their web site to read on the different things they do to be eco sustainable.  \\n\\nEverything they served us was made fresh and very very good, from the margaritas to the guacamole, a delicious lunch (if I remember, it was a fusion pork and tacos dish, Mexican and French, with salad and rice), and then dessert that night, a fantastic Pitaya pie.  The pie had two kinds of pitaya, one that tasted like strawberry and one that tasted like kiwi.  I have never had pie like that before!\\n\\nWe relaxed, slept in the hammock, dipped in their cool &quot;hot tub&quot; that had refreshing cold water, kayaked and spotted some whales far off breaching!, and went horse back riding to cap off the day.  That was a wonderful day(must have been 8-9 hours) spent with them and their Workaway volunteer from France who was great at handling the horses and entertaining our daughter.\\n\\nSince that day in July 2017, we have sent friends who were visiting to go horseback riding, and everyone had a great time. \\n\\nWe highly recommend visiting the ranch, it is a far different experience from what most visitors to the Baja are used to. It is so peaceful out there, looking out over the Sea of Cortez across to Isla Espiritu Santo.  At night it is so quiet, and so beautiful looking at the night sky covered in myriad stars.

Since it was going to be a long trip, we opted to rent a cabin with beds and a bathroom complete with a shower.  Our trip was fun, very different than our usual driving or flying.  The whole operation is quite spectacular:  we arrived at 5:50 PM, boarded the boat by 6:15, got our cabin key, and went out on the other decks to watch the trucks being loaded on the ferry.  Then the cars came aboard.  As all this was going on, we could see the beautiful Mazatlan sunset.  Went back inside to find a cozy little bar where we ordered margaritas.  Very good!  Dinner was served cafeteria style.  There were many tables from which to choose for dining.  By 10 PM we were ready for sleep.  We slept quite soundly, waking up a little before 6 AM.  Dressed and went downstairs to the restaurant for breakfast.  Included in the ticket price is coffee and sweet bread in the morning.  Other options are available for purchase.   For about 1.5 hours I stood outside watching the crew get the ferry ready for docking.  Its an amazing feat of engineering to get the boat into the harbor and then dockside.  Everything was done in an orderly fashion.  By the time we disembarked, there were already trucks being driven out of the ferry.  Both my husband and I highly recommend this trip at least once. Keep in mind that the temperature in the ferry is cool - you need a sweater.  And in the cabins, the  temperature is cold.  Fortunately, there are blankets in the rooms.

This is the worst experience ever in ferry for us. The company charges for every little thing, and they do not have the rules or rates for these charges written down anywhere. Paying the ticket fare is only the beginning of the multiple charges this company will nail you with if you plan to go in your car. In addition, getting on the ferry and disembarking the ferry takes hours, so be prepared. A 7 hour journey quickly turns into 12. They weigh your car 4 times, and charge $600 pesos each time. This is not included in the ticket price and no where is it written or was information provided to us about the number of times our vehicle would be weighed or the price for each weighing. If they believe you are traveling for commerical purposes, they charge an additional $800 pesos. The staff cannot provide a good reason for this policy, it is just one more way to overcharge their clients for this service. It seems like they are making up charges on the spot, given they do not have any written information regarding these additional charges and clients are not given any kind of notice of what they might be expected to pay. If you don\\'t need your car in La Paz, I would recommend flying instead of taking the ferry. Never have we been treated so poorly, and without reason from the company. If we knew about all of the additional charges and time to embark, disembark, all of the revisions, etc. we would have opted for the flight and paid for an Uber once in La Paz.

Our walk on experience :\\n\\nBeing as it was a day time trip,  we thought we would just enjoy being on the deck,  enjoying the sea,  perhaps spotting some sealife. We did do this,  but found the 7 hours to be overkill,  especially being as there are barely 3 metal benches upon which to sit.  The sun was hot and when there was no shade,  unbareable.  \\nWe moved to the lounge area:  comfortable for awhile,  until a live band began playing.  While the music wasn\\'t bad,  it was incredibly loud. \\nWe moved the the theater which was showing action movies in Spanish.  Not to begrudge Spanish speakers,  but not ideal again for us: loud w no subtitles. \\nWe moved to the dining room- nice, but after so many hours, we were not excited to sit in straight back chairs and listen to loud Spanish TV. \\nWe found there was no escaping the noise but for sunny outside- our best option for this trip. \\n(There were available cabins to rent on board,  but it wasn\\'t until 4 hours into the trip that we became desperate for some comfort and quiet- a hard time to spend the $50 or so to take a room.) \\nAdvice- Reserve a dang cabin to save your sanity.) \\n\\nBeing as the ferry to La Paz leaves Topolobampo at midnight,  we reserved a cabin in advance,  hallelujah!  The cheapest cabin was small,  clean,  w full bathroom,  and glorious for sleep.  \\n\\nWith a good enough meal to tide us over the hours,  the ferry is a fine way to travel.  But take a cabin,  both ways. \\n\\nOther notes:  If you want to book a hotel for first nights on the mainland,  do so in Los Mochis- approximate 20 miles inland from Topo.  (Fiesta Inn,  while nothing culturally exciting, was clean with a variety of good restaurants next door.)

That driver, who has supposedly driven to Mexico many times, was clearly unprepared. People need passports to cross borders, and vehicles need temporary import permits. I\\'ve gotten them myself several times and they\\'re very easy to obtain. Again, I speak Spanish, but if you don\\'t, don\\'t blame the Mexicans for not being able to communicate - that\\'s your responsibility when traveling in their country. \\n\\nSo, my experience from La Paz to Mazatlan was GREAT! I live most of the year in Puerto Vallarta and was driving my Mexican car, so I didn\\'t have any of the \\'temporary vehicle import\\' paperwork to do. If you\\'re driving a US or Canadian vehicle, you will need such a permit. They\\'re actually very easy to get and you can do it online before you leave your country. They will FedEx the permit to you and you\\'re done. I\\'ve done it 3-4 times myself. \\n\\nThis is a ferry, not a cruise ship, so tone your expectations down and you\\'ll be fine. I had a Jr. Suite, only about $30 USD more than a regular cabin, and I got a balcony, though they have the sliding windows screwed shut which was a bummer. The dining room is cafeteria style and the food was adequate. They had live music for a few hours and the entertainers were really good at involving the younger crowd and everyone had a good time. The rear deck is open air and a nice place to watch when you sail out and when you arrive. There was a fooz ball table, a bar, a tiny \\'cafe\\' and a bit of a gift shop. There are two large lounges, set up like a stripped down business class section of an airliner. There are 9 big leather, comfy-looking seats per row, separated by 2 aisles, again just like an airplane, with lots of flat screens and they show movies all night. I was surprised at how violent one was and all the kids sitting there, but I\\'m not a parent, so not my issue. If you are a parent, beware... If you don\\'t take a cabin, this is the most comfortable place for you to spend the 13 hour trip. \\n\\nSo, boarding was really easy, and so efficient. They obviously do this a lot and the skids are well-greased. As is typical in Mexico, there aren\\'t many directional signs, so when driving from section to section of the docks, you may need to ask for help. Because of an event in La Paz, our ferry left a couple hours late, so I was doing this in the dark which I\\'m sure also made is harder. \\n\\nI drove out to the docks the day prior and bought my ticket at the office there. I wanted to get the lay of the land, so I knew what to expect. I\\'m glad I did. They give you several tickets which are collected at various points during the boarding process. I was traveling with my dog who is a registered service animal. They wanted copies of his certificate and letter from my doctor. And they asked to see his leash tag and red support vest. Not many businesses in Mexico recognize service animals, so this was a treat! Otherwise, your pet will be in a locked pet room with others and you MUST have a secure crate for him to travel in. You cannot enter the room, but you can peer through the window. My service dog stayed with me the entire time, but was restricted to the cabin and required to be in his crate. That was no problem for me. \\n\\nWhen I got to the dock, the first thing is Mexican Customs. This is a major shipping route, so lots of goods going back and forth, lots of big semi trucks, etc. My car was loaded with personal possessions for my home, so I had no duty to pay. Also a word of advice for gun-loving Americans and people traveling with any drugs, including \\'medical\\' marijuana. All firearms and ALL drugs are totally illegal in Mexico. If you somehow got across the border without getting arrested, you are going through customs again here. If you have weed with you, dump it before you get to the docks and buy it again when you get to the mainland. It\\'s not worth it.\\n\\nSo, after they inspected my vehicle, next is the weighing in and the measuring. At this point, you will also pay a customs tax which you don\\'t pay when you buy your ticket. I think it was $176 pesos, so roughly $10 USD. Then, you drive to your ship. I drove up, they took another of my tickets, then directed me to drive into the belly, back into place and that was that. So simple. I must say I was really surprised at how simple it was. I\\'ve lived full and part time in Mexico for 14 years and rarely are things things simple. Again, I speak Spanish and I know that helps. If you don\\'t, it will doubtlessly be more complicated, but it\\'s your lack of understanding, not their lack of established process. I had previously packed a napsack with only what I needed for overnight, so I grabbed it and went up to Reception. At reception, I was assigned a steward to assist me - I suspect this is because I had a Jr. Suite. I noticed near me were also 3-4 VIP suites, but I didn\\'t see anyone else being helped to their cabin. You will leave your ID at Reception and they\\'ll return it to you when you return your key in the morning. \\n\\nThe Sea of Cortez was very calm and there was only a very gentle rocking at times. I thoroughly enjoyed my trip, slept fairly well. The cabin was cold to me and I used blankets from another bed. Even in my Jr. Suite, there were 4 twin beds, 2 sets of bunks, Murphy style, that folded up against the walls. The bath had soap and shampoo provided and a hair dryer. I also had a little fridge with 2 complimentary beers, a couple bottles of water and I think a couple sodas. I used only the water. Oh, there is no WiFi and no cell coverage most of the way. \\n\\nArriving in Mazatlan and the disembarking process could not have been easier. As soon as we arrived, the put down the ramps, announced for all drivers to line up at the door to go down to their vehicles. We walked down the stairs, into the belly, got into our cars and I was off the ship in 5 minutes. Once on the dock, the exit was clearly marked, leads right to a major artery and there was clear signage to the 15 Highway for my 6-7 hour drive to Puerto Vallarta. I was home by late afternoon.\\n\\nAll in all, this was a really comfortable way to travel. The total cost for me was about $250 USD, I think $4650 pesos. The cabin was only $1350 pesos, the rest was for my car. It was also a bit of an adventure and I would highly recommend people do this. If you\\'re going to be in La Paz or Mazatlan and have the time, it would even be worth it to take the ferry for a couple day side trip to the other city. \\n\\nI would do this trip again in a heartbeat!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Baja Ferries", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Pichilingue, Baja California Sur", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "564029781": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Comfortable overnight ferry", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d2180099-Reviews-Baja_Ferries-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We took the ferry from La Paz to Mazatlan.

There was plenty of hot water and the bed was comfortable.  Our passage included Dinner and coffee/roll in the morning.  There was very good entertainment in the evening.  We both speak Spanish, but feel boarding the Ferry with a vehicle could be confusing for those without any Spanish, primarily because there are few personnel who speak English at the Port.  Also, we encourage obtaining your car permit at the Border or in Ensenanda, as Banjercito at the Port closes at 3:00 pm.  Fortunately, we found out that important piece of information before going to the Port, as the Ferry only runs three times a week.  In addition, make sure you pick up your tourist visa at the Border or in Ensenada; all foreigners are required to have one in Baja California.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Baja Ferries", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Pichilingue, Baja California Sur", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "550856393": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Loved it", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d2180099-Reviews-Baja_Ferries-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "More than I expected!

Turned in my room key before 7:00, got into my car around 8:15, then stopped 3 times on the way out--had to pay under 100 pesos for something upon leaving (don\\'t speak much Spanish, so I often have no clue what is going on) had to stop for military to inspect my car (asked if I had any fruit with me) and had to stop and pay 30 pesos for some guy to spray my tires with what I can only guess was weed killer. The only regret is that there was no travel during daylight hours, so you don\\'t get to see dolphins, whales, fish or whatever else might be seen along the way if it were not at night. It was nice and quiet for sleeping, but I seem to feel exhausted anyway. Maybe because I\\'m not used to getting up so early. Anyway it sure beats driving and I recommend it. I tried to buy online, but couldn\\'t get the English version to work at all, and when I used the Spanish version, I thought it went through, but it didn\\'t accept my payment for some reason, even though it gave me a confirmation number, so I went to the office and bought it in person, 5 days prior, which is probably the way to go anyway.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Baja Ferries", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Pichilingue, Baja California Sur", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "546706262": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "VIP room", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d2180099-Reviews-Baja_Ferries-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We purchased the vip room.

But I have to admit I don\\u2019t understand why this ship and this company get such awful reviews here.  My partner and I were very satisfied and we had a great time.  From booking the tickets on the phone in English, to fixing an error in the spelling of my partner\\u2019s name at the Mazatl\\u00e1n ticket office, to the trip itself, I really couldn\\u2019t find anything to complain about.\\n\\nI\\u2019ll write a long review because I think it\\u2019s worth adding a positive point of view to all the negatives that have been expressed.\\n\\nShort version:  it\\u2019s great.  You have nothing to fear \\u2013 except maybe being peer-pressured into singing karaoke in Spanish in the bar.\\n \\nLonger version:\\n\\nIf you expect a luxury cruise, you\\u2019ll be disappointed.  But if you want a clean, safe, comfortable, fun and cheap way to cross between Mazatl\\u00e1n and La Paz, I highly recommend the ferry.  As it happens, our fare for two passengers in the most expensive private cabin on board cost almost exactly what two airline tickets would have cost on the daily Calaf\\u00eda nonstop flight.  Smaller cabins or a seat in economy class are even cheaper.\\n \\nWe knew from reading the website that they require large suitcases to be checked \\u2013 not because our room was too small (it was huge), but because some of the hallways on board are very narrow.  So we packed a change of clothes and our toiletries in an overnight bag.  Checking the suitcase was quick and easy, and it was waiting for us when we disembarked at La Paz.\\n \\nWe were told to arrive three hours before scheduled departure, which we did, and we boarded only about 15 minutes later.  Boarding was easy and well organized, and there\\u2019s an elevator for those who can\\u2019t handle the four or five flights of stairs from water level to the passenger quarters.  Once on the boat there was a virtually no wait to check in at reception, where we were given our key (in exchange for my ID, returned upon checkout).  A nice lady showed us to our room and described its features.\\n \\nWe left Mazatl\\u00e1n right on time at 6:30 pm, and arrived in La Paz on schedule just shy of 13 hours later.\\n \\nWe were in cabin VIP 4.  VIP 1 is the only other one as large.  They have a large sitting area with a sofa and coffee table, two queen beds, closet, desk, enclosed balcony with table and chairs, wall-mounted TV, a floor fan to supplement the AC, and a full bathroom with shower.  These are corner suites with side view and bow view.  The other two VIP cabins only face forward and are a bit smaller, probably with no balcony, but I\\u2019m sure they\\u2019re very nice.\\n \\nMost of the other cabins appear to have bunk beds, but I got a peek into a few of them and they seem just fine.  Not as extensively furnished, but it\\u2019s a short trip.  If you just want a bed and a bathroom but plan to spend your waking time in the common areas of the ship, the standard cabins seem just fine.  As for the economy seats, well, they wouldn\\'t be my first choice, especially considering the standard cabins are pretty cheap.  But the economy areas were clean and in good condition.\\n \\nYou can plug a HDMI cable into the wall-mounted TV, or borrow a DVD at no cost from the collection at reception.\\n \\nThe dinner isn\\u2019t the best meal you\\u2019ll ever have, but it wasn\\u2019t bad either. Basic airplane-quality food, served cafeteria style.  The restaurant is large and very clean.  Breakfast is a sweet roll and coffee or tea, shortly before arrival.\\n \\nThe bar/lounge is attached to the restaurant, offering bar service and table service.  They were still open and serving drinks when I went to bed around midnight.  There was a (really cheesy but fun) band that played from about 8:00 until 10:00, and then the karaoke guy took over.  It was a total blast to hang out with the tipsy truck drivers and sing romantic pop ballads in Spanish.\\n \\nOn the lower level is a small caf\\u00e9 and convenience store, offering coffee, hard and soft drinks, snacks, souvenirs and convenience items such as toiletries.  They closed around 11:00 and re-opened at 6:30.\\n \\nI slept like a baby, and the next morning there was plenty of hot water for a comfortable shower.\\n \\nUpon check-out, I returned my key, then waited about 5-10 minutes for my room to be inspected.  They called my name over the loudspeaker when the inspection was complete, and returned my ID.\\n \\nIt took a while to get off the boat.  For some reason, Baja California Sur imposes a security inspection upon arrival, and that really slowed things down.  From being told we could disembark to actually being in a taxi was probably 45 minutes.\\n \\nEvery crew member we interacted with was nice and helpful.  There was none of that apathetic, bureaucratic attitude you sometimes see in service people.  They all seem to like their jobs.  We interacted with them in Spanish, so I really don\\u2019t know how extensively English is spoken, although the guy at reception offered to help us in English if we needed it.\\n \\nThe downside:  it\\u2019s not a smooth voyage.  From the moment we hit open water the boat rocked from side to side, sometimes softly and sometimes more aggressively, but it was constant.  It didn\\u2019t bother me at all, but sometimes it put my partner off balance. Maybe not recommended for people prone to motion sickness.\\n\\nAll in all, we\\u2019re very satisfied and would travel again with Baja Ferries.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Baja Ferries", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Pichilingue, Baja California Sur", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "538781447": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Soursweet experience", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d2180099-Reviews-Baja_Ferries-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I took the ferry from La Paz to Mazatlan great welcome by Alfredo who reanimes ar out service and was great part of the crew.

When I awoke in the morning, I was surprised with a beautiful view of the Sea of Cortez and the islands that lined the entrance to La Paz harbor. It was an easy trip, and the return was just as nice. I highly recommend this trip to anyone, with or without a car...!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Baja Ferries", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Pichilingue, Baja California Sur", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "477312596": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beyond Bad...

My husband and I rode our motorcycle down to La Paz from the states and took Baja Ferry (specifically Baja Star) across the Sea of Cortez to Mazatlan back in late January. It was a 12 hour ferry, departing at 8pm and arriving at 7:30-8am the next day. Ferry\\'s have different schedules so be sure to look it up online. They do not run everyday. (For those of you reading for animal info. we didn\\'t have our puppy until traveling back to La Paz from Mazatlan in late March, so scroll down for that info.) Our experience leaving from La Paz wasn\\'t bad, just very different then when leaving from Mazatlan. In La Paz, we were asked to get to the docks 3 hours before our ferry was scheduled to leave. The paperwork for the bike was a hassle, so I was glad we bought our tickets a few days before and not day of. Anyways, we arrived at 5pm to the docks (located about 20-30 minutes out of La Paz), our ferry scheduled to leave at 8. We pulled into the loading area and had to push a button to see if we would have to get our vehicle searched. It is totally random but our light happened to turn red, so we pulled open our bags and showed the employees. I have to say that they were very kind and even made small talk with us. No big deal there. After that, my husband and I had to separate because only one driver was allowed to go with the vehicle, regardless of if it was a car or moto. My husband had to pay about $4.00 USD to have the moto weighed which was silly because they make it mandatory, but it was quick and easy since we got there early. He waited in line with the other vehicles for quite a while even though we were some of the first passengers there, not being able to load until after most of the trucks since he had a small vehicle. I had to wait inside, an area similar to airport seating when waiting for a plane, until 7pm, an hour before the ferry was scheduled to leave. There were a lot of people traveling on the ferry which seems to be the norm. If you have a cabin, they let you bring your luggage with you, but if you just have a seat they make you check your stuff. At 6, they had everyone line up and go through a similar process as the car. They individually asked if I had any drugs or alcohol, I said no, then I had to push another button to see if my things would be searched. It turned green this time so I was free to head on without having to open my stuff. From there, I walked directly onto the ferry. You walk through the truck/car loading area on a designated pathway, lead by an employee. They take you to a door that leads up some steep stairs to the boat\\'s reception area. My husband said they allow the drivers to take an elevator, so that is an option. Though I wouldn\\'t say the ferry (Baja Star) was brand new, it is very clean and well maintained. They have AC running so it is cool, even though the cities are hot. I checked in at reception, but they wouldn\\'t give me the key to our cabin because my husband had the cabin ticket. So i waited about 45 minutes for him to make it to the reception area. He had to give up his ID to get the room key, but was given it back the next morning no problem. The cabin was very simple, but nice. We got one with a window and TV, though the Tv had no channels. The window is definitely nice if you tend to get sea sick, though not necessary at all. The room had 4 twin beds in it, sort of like bunk beds, and a clean bathroom with towels, toiletries, shower, sink and toilet. It also had lots of storage, including a cabinet with life vests. It was comfortable and very clean for a night\\'s stay. We had 0 issues with the room. If you don\\'t purchase a cabin ($45 and up) you are assigned a seat, similar to a nice airplane seat, in a certain room. The downside to this is that they have TV\\'s blasting movies all night long, and the rooms are cold. If you choose this option, i suggest earplugs and a blanket.. I read a lot of reviews about people complaining about the included dinner, but it wasn\\'t bad at all. You get to choose a main, like chicken or beef, then they also give you refried beans, rice, corn tortillas, a choice of water or soda, and jello. If you are super high maintenance, it won\\'t be good enough for you, but we were thankful for the food. They have vending machines on site with snacks and drinks, and they also have a bar, as well as other food options in the restaurant area.  In the restaurant itself, they had a live performer singing, meaning people were getting up and dancing and having a good time. Dinner is usually served between a 2-3 hour window, so you have plenty of time to settle in, then go eat. The ship also has some entertainment things like fooseball table, air hockey, video games, and stuffed animal machines. They have live announcement going off every once in a while in both Spanish and English. The only time this is annoying is at 6AM. They also have a small shop on the boat, tax free, with perfumes and some alcohol. Breakfast the next morning is not included, though they serve coffee and pastries for cheap. Once we arrived in Mazatlan, they made several announcements and had security guards all over on the boat to help you figure out where to go. Once again, my husband and I had to separate, he getting in line to go down with the drivers, and me exiting by foot. Exiting into Mazatlan is a little confusing because the cars don\\'t exit in the same place, so make sure you have communication with whomever you are with if you have a vehicle so you can find each other. We left right on time at 8PM, and arrived right on time between 7:30 and 8 am the next morning. No issues. Overall, I would give this trip a 5/5. \\n\\nNow for Mazatlan back to La Paz. Purchasing the ticket this time was super easy. The dog was free, and we got a cheaper cabin this time, one with no window. Simple, 4 twin beds and a bathroom. It was nice, I would get that one again to save the few bucks that the window and the tv cost. It was clean and well stocked. Anyways, we bought our tickets 3 days before the ferry was scheduled to leave. This time the ferry was to leave at 6:30, though the office employee didn\\'t tell us we needed to arrive 3 hours early like in La Paz. The lady at the office told us we HAVE to bring our own dog cage. She said it had to be a hard cage, but no one ever checks. We said ok. If you are scrambling to find one, both Walmarts in Mazatlan sell them for between $20.00-$50.00 depending on the size you need. There are also local pet stores that sell pet carriers, though it won\\'t be comfortable for your pet. We used a carrier and we wished we didn\\'t because she was stuck laying down the entire time. We arrived to the dock about 2 hours early this time, and separated again, my husband going with the moto and me by foot with our puppy. I only had to show my passport and ticket to a random lady standing in a heard of other passengers, and then wait about 20 minutes until they start letting us board. No one even checked to make sure I had a pet cage or anything. The only security procedure was a military man with a dog making us set our luggage on the ground and having the dog sniff it. That was it literally. It took 30 seconds and then we got on the actual boat, this time much earlier than just an hour before, once again lead by an employee to a door and up some steep stairs. By the time I got on the boat, about 4:45-5:00pm, my husband was already on. He didn\\'t have to wait behind all the other cars to load the moto, and like me, security was very simple getting onto the boat. I took my ticket to reception and the lady was going to have a man escort us to our room. If you have a pet, you could easily sneak them into your room by having one person hold them in their carrier nearby while the other is shown the room by the employee, then meet up later. The lady didn\\'t even look at my information other then my cabin ticket. This being our first time, we didn\\'t do that. The man showed my husband to the &quot;Area de Mascotas,&quot; a very small room on the upper deck, not cold or hot, but just small, locked with a pad lock at all times. We had to set our puppy on the floor or on one of the shelves in her pet carrier and leave her there. (We read other reviews saying some ferry\\'s have built in cages, and some have rooms for pets and some don\\'t) I guess all ferry\\'s are different. This one had no pre-built-in cages. Anyways, the employees had no problem letting us go visit her when we wanted to, however, you have to ask reception and someone has to accompany you because they have to unlock the door, wait for you, then lock it again. It was a hassle and felt rushed because they had to wait on you, it wasn\\'t like we could sit and play with her for an hour. We were not allowed to walk her or let her leave the little room. She was in there for a total of 13.5 hours. There is nowhere for her to poop or pee, so she ended up peeing A LOT in her pet carrier. It was pretty sad and I was surprised they wouldn\\'t let us take her to the bathroom. The ship didn\\'t end up leaving until 8PM, and we didnt get in on time either. We got our included dinner, same as the other ferry ride, and once again it was good. We headed to our room and hung out for the evening after walking around the ship a bit. You are allowed to be on the deck which is nice if you need fresh air. The next morning, we woke up at 6:30, expecting to arrive in La Paz by 7:30, but we didn\\'t have to even get out of bed until 8AM. The ship didn\\'t dock until about 9am, and we didn\\'t get off until about 9:30 or later. They wouldn\\'t let us get the dog until vehicles were able to unload, so even though we went to see the puppy around 8 to feed her and give her water, we had to put her back in the cage for another 1.5 hours until it was time to get off with out vehicle. If you are taking your pet, I suggest a nice carrier with room for them to stand up, a hook-on water dish, and maybe a pee mat. Even though it is super sad doing it, if you must take the ferry with your animal, it is totally doable. When I finally got my puppy, I had to exit the boat, and there was nowhere for me to take her to the bathroom because I had to go through security-a metal detector, and have someone check my documents. Of course, because I was a white girl by myself, I was the only one stopped and asked to show my passport and get asked questions in the middle of the building, well my dog wasn\\'t in her cage because I had to walk her through the detector out of the cage, so she popped a squat and peed and pooped right on the floor. Then I got yelled at which was ironic because I was forced to take her our of her carrier by security in the first place. But (sorry to say) I didn\\'t care. I cleaned it up of course, but what else was she supposed to do? Especially because she\\'s a puppy and wasn\\'t allowed to go to the bathroom on the boat for over 12 hours. Anyways, I met my husband outside and we were off. Finding him this time was much easier. I would rate this ferry a 3/5 only because of the animal situation and late departure/arrival time, everything else (dinner, boat quality, cabin, etc...)  was nice. If you have specific questions, ask the employees in the BajaFerry office in person when buying your tickets. Don\\'t just assume stuff. Especially because the website is not very specific.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Baja Ferries", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Pichilingue, Baja California Sur", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "470947807": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "From Topolobampo-La Paz and back to Topolobampo", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d2180099-Reviews-Baja_Ferries-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "WOW!

I think there are at least 2 ferries available. We embarked as passengers; no car; and, all in all, it was a good experience. \\nHere are the pertinent items: \\n* I purchased our cabina tickets online without a hitch (I couldn\\u2019t believe it was so easy and the website worked pretty well except for a big glitch mentioned below) and, although the web page announced a 5:30 p.m. departure (begin loading at 2:30), the Mazatl\\u00e1n office said 6:30 and, by gosh, the ship got going at 6:30 on the button. Arrival time was 7 a.m. the next morning and we were there on time too. \\n* The boarding was a bit confusing because we didn\\u2019t know how the baggage reception procedure went, and no one told us, so we had to look carefully and ask questions (we speak Spanish, few English speakers around). We discovered we had to line up our bags at a certain spot for them to be loaded separately. And, at the last minute, we also learned that you are allowed to take only 1 bag per person per cabina for use during overnight, so we scrambled unceremoniously on that account as the bags were being loaded. In other words, if you want your tooth paste or your nightgown overnight, make sure you pack it in the one bag allowable because your other baggage is stowed separately. \\n* Climbing aboard the big ship (with our bags, 1 each, the elevator came in very handy), we found very attentive ferry employees who answered our questions and directed us to our cabin which we found to be clean though Spartan. We found the bathroom small but gleamy clean, supplied with tissue, toilet paper etc. Beds were thin-mattressed but adequate, bottled water, etc. The ferry d\\u00e9cor in general was steel, glass, and chrome; antiseptic and clean as a whistle.\\n* Eating on the ferry was good for folks without strict diets like mine. The food, served cafeteria style, was mostly Mexican (picadillo, roasted chicken, beans, rice, tortillas) with jello dessert, plus non-alcoholic drinks, all included in the price of our ticket, alcohol was sold separately. The eating area was shared with the night-club zone so we ate our repast as we listened to a live woman singer with a hefty repertoire accompanied by recorded Mexican music. Except for a couple of raucous fans, we enjoyed the show. Guards were in attendance all the while. \\n* Even though we had cabinas we were also assigned seats in a large auditorium equipped with TV screens. Like the ferry in general, the room was hospital-clean and about as inviting. Ferry riders without cabinas spent the night in this room; the chairs, not unlike economy airplane seats, looked comfortable. \\n* A majority of the passengers on our ferry were young Mexican males who were dressed, more often than not, in jeans, light jackets and tennis shoes; more like American high school youngsters, but with a rural touch. Inquiring with the ferry officials they informed me these lads were on their way to work in agricultural jobs in Baja. They were low-key and respectful. \\n* My wife and I were astonished at the amount of traffic the ferry transported from the mainland to Baja. It explains why ferry officials require a 3 hour loading time. Most of the vehicles were truck and trailer combinations. The quantity blew our mind. \\nProblems:\\n--This is the big glitch. When I ordered our tickets online I inadvertently did so requesting 2 cabins when we needed only one. I discovered this error late and their website is not mistake friendly. When I appealed to the ticket agents in person in the Mazatl\\u00e1n office, the response was cool and limited. They could only give me a credit good for one year. So, when you get your tickets online, go slowly and deliberately! \\n--The other problem as that the office girls in Mazatl\\u00e1n behaved more like Mexican government employees, not very responsive to the customer. I didn\\u2019t know that you had to take a number to be attended to, and complained because I didn\\u2019t see any signs telling you so. \\nOtherwise, the Baja Ferry was a good experience!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Baja Ferries", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Pichilingue, Baja California Sur", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "462048853": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A good way to see the other parts of Mexico", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d2180099-Reviews-Baja_Ferries-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Generally the ferry was ok.

The driver must drive around and re- enter the complex to pick up any passengers and they can only do this once all vehicles have exited.  Took over an hour for my husband to be able to come back and get me.  Would have been much better if there were a spot for drivers to pull in and pick up passengers before leaving the terminal.

Bring something for breakfast and snacks.  It was completely inhumane for the dog.  He was allowed out of his kennel, but not out of the small room that housed the mascotas.  I talked one of the workers into letting me walk him a bit out of the authorities sight.  15 hours is too long to keep a pet in complete captivity.

I had always enjoyed ferry trips on my motorcycle both in the US and in Europe, and though this was a great plan to see Baja on my way to my destination.\\n\\nI was wrong. \\n\\nFirst there was the reservation thing. They lost my reservation, so no cabin. That\\'s Ok, I will take a seat. No seats, but you can sleep in the chairs in the cafeteria. Not much choice, as the next ferry was in two days, and it was full also.\\n\\nThe cafeteria is at most 10 X 10 meters, and there are a couple of hundred people that have bought meals that are going to get them. Dinner, which is included in the price, was a long wait to get served cafeteria style, only to find out that there was no place to sit. And while the menu seemed good, fish or meat, they ran out of both about half way thru the crowd. I got tortillas and re-fried beans (out of a can) for dinner. \\n\\nThe boat is really crowded, as it is clear that they oversold tickets. Pretty much anyone who showed up got on, and unfortunately it was just before Holy Week, so there was a lot of national tourist. You could not stand at the railing to look over the side, because it was always packed. \\n\\nThe cafeteria was showing what seem like a endless loop of Jan-Claude Van Damme movies, ALL  NIGHT LONG, so you can image how much sleep was going on there.\\n\\nOh, and did I mention how late they are. It was supposed to leave at 2 and finally left at 5, then it was supposed to arrive at 11, did not make it until 3. But they made you line up to get on starting at 12, so there went 26 hours of my life. \\n\\nOn the way back, I showed up at Mazatlan for my return trip I had already paid for, only to be informed that the boat would not be carrying passengers. Trucks have a priority and they were oversubscribed, so car and motorcycle passengers would have to go up to Topolobampo, 5 hours north and take a ferry over to La Paz from there. \\n\\nI did get a cabin for the trip back, and it was a lot more civilized, although again the food ran out and I again had tortillas with beans (although they were black beans this time, so there was some variety). And also, again, the trip was delayed by 3 hours, so another 5 hours of waiting around to get on.\\n\\nI suspect that my experience was unusually poor, mostly due to the unfortunate timing. But there is no getting around the fact that the ferry caters to truckers, and everybody else should be thankful they make it safely to the other side.\\n\\nNot doing that again, ever.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "1"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Baja Ferries", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Pichilingue, Baja California Sur", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "438100423": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Great trip from La Paz to Mazatlan and back", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d2180099-Reviews-Baja_Ferries-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "First time ever on a ferry with my car.

This is not like any Ferry ride you have taken before.  You need a passport, export documentation for your vehicle if coming from La Paz, there are fees of all sorts &quot;leaving&quot; Mexico in LaPaz and then &quot;leaving&quot; Mexico in Los Mochis to come back plus an &quot;export&quot; deposit for your vehicle that you cannot get back unless you go to Tijuana to the &quot;export bank&quot; of Mexico to get your deposit back......Sound complicated??  You bet!\\n\\nHow about this? Once you drive your car on-board, you better have not forgotten anything because you won\\'t be allowed back down to your car until you have arrived at your destination (Topolabampo or Mazatlan) and even then you will not be allowed on deck until all the trucks have been taken off.  This is not your Father\\'s Ferry ride in Seattle or Staten Island.  You might as well be taking a ferry to Guatamala based on the way things are handled for a &quot;domestic&quot; ferry ride that never leaves Mexican territory in any way.\\n\\nThe good part of the ride is if you get a suite, especially from Topolabampo where you depart at 11pm and arrive at 7am or so.  The beds are very comfortable and they in-room bathroom is clean and terrific with a shower and the people on the boat working are very nice.  They just follow the rules and it is the rules that are stupid, not the people.  The food is good and the coffee is good!\\n\\nIt is an adventure and will give you plenty of cocktail stories when you get home!  Lastly, the best part of this ride is starting a drive that took us all the way to Cancun and back with over 3800 miles in mainland Mexico....it was the best drive ever and aside from some bureaucratic baloney like the Ferry ride, Mexico is a fabulous and lovely country with great people in every state and even better food everywhere.

I found it a little difficult to book as I wanted a cabin and couldn\\'t seem to get one online when I was trying to book.  I called the number on the website, but had a bit of difficulty as between the less than great phone connection and the language barrier, it was tricky.  Luckily, our estimator at work speaks fluent Spanish and phoned and did the booking for me....problem solved.  So, off my hubby, my two sons (4 and 6) and I went on a grand adventure.  :)\\n\\nWhen we first got to the terminal in Mazatl\\u00e1n, there was some confusion over the whereabouts of my tickets which I was told would be held for me for pick up.  Fortunately, a quick walk to the next building and there they all were safe and sound.  We ended up waiting and waiting and waiting to board the ship, but the kids enjoyed watching the big trucks drive on.  We checked our two large suitcases and took a few small carry ons on board with us.  When it was time to board, we did have to climb a lot of steep narrow steps and it was generally a hot sweaty experience.  The staff were all very helpful and we got our cabin just fine.  The cabin we had was actually much better than anticipated.  It had four single beds (two sets of bunks), a sink, and a bathroom complete with shower.  All were very clean.  We spent until early evening on the deck which was nice watching the sunset.  The kids enjoyed watching and listening to all that was going on.  Being a prairie girl, I was somewhat petrified at the prospect of one of them going over the railing, but all was well.  The ferry itself isn\\'t what was portrayed on the website or brochures, but more what one would expect of a ferry.  Basically a floating bus depot.  The supper menu was limited, but doable.  Between the four of us we had a burger, fries, and a plate of nachos all of which was just fine.  There was also beer for sale if you wanted.  We went to bed early and everyone slept well.  Somehow, we managed to miss breakfast.  My husband had gone out around 6 or 6:30 and came back with the two remaining yogurts from the night before.  We went up on the deck, came back in and showered and breakfast was over.  So, we were all starving for lunch by the time we arrived.  Getting off the ferry was even longer than getting on.  We waited for about an hour in a hot hallway, but we made it there.  It was an experience and I wouldn\\'t be against doing it again, but I\\'d definitely take some food.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Baja Ferries", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Pichilingue, Baja California Sur", "addressLocality": "La Paz", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "232792253": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "5 hours late", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150771-d2180099-Reviews-Baja_Ferries-La_Paz_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/99/dd/caifornia-star.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We were traveling from La Paz to Topolobampo.

First, the departure time we were given was completely inaccurate. We were told to be at the ferry terminal several hours before a 2am departure (not sure why). After arriving at 10.30pm and waiting for a couple of hours we were told the ferry would not be leaving until 6am. We tried (mostly unsuccessfully) to sleep in the terminal only to find out the time had been pushed back again to 8:30am. Unbelievable! By the time everyone boarded the vessel and we left port it was approx 10:30am, 12 hours after we were told to arrive at the terminal! What a waste of time.\\n\\nThe second issue was that the ferry was crowded and dirty. We did not get a cabin but from the looks of them they weren\\'t that great. However, anything would have been better than the &quot;movie room&quot; the rest of the passengers were crowded into. If for some awful reason I had to use this service again I would get a cabin.\\n\\nThe last of my top 3 reasons this ferry sucked is that the boat itself was not very accommodating to passengers. Besides the crowded seating and limited bathrooms, there was very little outdoor seating which would have been a great way to escape the diesel fumes from the countless semi-trucks on the boat. Note that this is not a typical passenger ferry! Another reviewer referred to it as a low end carnival cruise line. I don\\'t think it comes anywhere near this generous description. The ship\\'s primary purpose is to transport vehicles, not people...which is very apparent.\\n\\nAll in all the trip took 20 hours (including our wasted time in the ferry terminal).

I can see how others may have had it better, but several points soured us on this company.  In particular, when we booked in advance by phone we were told that our dog ABSOLUTELY had to be crated (any other ferry we could leave her in the car: it was January and not hot) and since they had only a few crates we were told we should bring one or we would not get on if their crates were full.  So, we spent time tracking down a crate (not easy in Mexico, not cheap either).  Our dog is not use to being crated and was quite stressed, not to mention the crate area was with the big trucks which idled for the whole trip.  We were not allowed to visit her either.\\n\\nThis is basically a truck ferry that is obliged to take people: that is how we were treated.  The ferry food (that we had no option but to pay for with our ticket) was pure slop, and the &quot;lounge&quot; was playing bad music at earsplitting levels. We would have loved to have sprung for a private room, but they were all pre booked.\\n\\nWorst of all, while I was waiting with another wife on the tarmac at the other side while they subjected our husbands/vechicles to a separate search (dogs, you name it, to go from one Mexican province to another???)

Oh and also we DID arrive safe and sound - if a tad overheated - in Mazatlan on time. \\n\\nThe ferries are pictured on line as a sort of cruise experience. They show photos of a spacious lounge with comfortable blue plush chairs and another spacious lounge restaurant with plush burgundy chairs, a discoteque even. The on line photos also show frosty glasses of mixed cocktails served with snacks. The folder that our tickets came in had a happy couple in sort of tennis whites and a fancy plate of nicely arranged seafood on a white linen table cloth...well we went looking for either of those lounges - even the discoteque would have been OK - but the only food and beverage facility on our ship was a small, stuffy room with chipped arborite covered tables and tatty plastic chairs. It looked like a crew lounge for the clean up staff. There was a bar in the corner but no frosty glasses or plates of snacks. The bar offered beer or soft drinks - in the bottle or tin - and potato chips or cookies - in the bag. \\n\\nTwo meals dinner and breakfast were served in what I would call army style from a steam table. You pointed at what you wanted and one of the staff plopped a ladle full of it on your plate - not quite the white linen and seafood experience pictured on the ticket folder or even the &quot;buffet&quot; experience pictured on the web site. The food was however, tasty and free! \\n\\nWe had one of the outside cabins, it had a window overlooking a life boat (good to know that they DO have them), two very narrow single beds arranged at right angles and a tiny bathroom with shower. The room was fine for one night, it was clean, there were clean towels and sheets and the shower had plenty of water pressure. The a/c was a little weak but it was OK.  We stayed in the room a lot because the &quot;on deck&quot; experience was  not very pleasant.\\n\\nThe decks were dirty and everything metal was extremely rusty. It looked like the ship had not been cleaned or painted in years. There were few places to sit on deck anyway. The stern passenger deck was unbearably hot from engine exhaust and stunk of rotting garbage. The port side passenger deck had one small bench for seating, the starboard passenger deck had no seating at all. \\n\\nThe elevator from the car decks was broken and the four or five flights of stairs up and down are extremely narrow and steep. \\n\\nAll in all it was a horrible voyage that I would not recommend to anyone and I will never take again. I don\\'t think that the ship we were on was either of those featured in the Baja Ferry\\'s online site. It appeared to be of French origin based on the directional signage in French that remained painted on the walls and the interior didn\\'t look like either of the ships pictured. \\n\\nBoarding in La Paz was brutal. We were kept waiting on hot tarmac with no shade in sight for over two hours while semi-trailers were boarded first. Another annoying thing is that all passengers except those actually driving a vehicle must embark and disembark on foot. I wasn\\'t driving, I was the car passenger and I can certify that it is a hot and humid walk from the ship to the passenger waiting area when you get to Mazatlan. \\n\\nI\\'d suggest that if you want to book - or better need to book - with Baja Ferries you first determine that you won\\'t be on the French ship we were on.
