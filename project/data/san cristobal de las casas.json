Our travel agency recommended we visit the Centro de Textiles del Mundo Maya, so we did, walking there from our hotel. \\n\\nThe beginning on the museum actually had artifacts from the region that weren\\'t textiles at all, but they were interesting. Upstairs was the main museum. There were beautiful handmade blankets, clothing, and more. The items were very colorful and had so much detail. They must have taken a long time to make. \\n\\nOutside the museum was a vendor area where many tents were set up and people were selling things. We did not really check these out.\\n\\nThe pieces are from Mexico and Central America and there were many items to look at. There was a video but most of the museum has very little English, but just looking at the items doesn\\'t need a language to see how much work went into their creation.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Centro de Textiles del Mundo Maya", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/99/9c/09/centro-de-textiles-del.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av 20 de Noviembre", "addressLocality": "San Cristobal de las Casas", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29200", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "615401207": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "High quality with intentions to preserve ancient skills.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150802-d3857074-Reviews-Centro_de_Textiles_del_Mundo_Maya-San_Cristobal_de_las_Casas_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/99/9c/09/centro-de-textiles-del.jpg", "datePublished": "September 10, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Great to see the high end weaving, but too pricey for casual shopping.

Nobody knows when the works will terminate, but it is to be expected that they will last long. The fa\\u00e7ade is however visible, although some fences partially obstruct it. This Churrigueresque fa\\u00e7ade is one of the most beautiful in Mexico: it is totally sculpted and decorated, and it is definitely the best sight in San Crist\\u00f3bal.\\n\\nEven if the visit of Santo Domingo will leave you unsatisfied, the visit of the large handicrafts market which surrounds the church will largely compensate your disappointment. There are innumerable stalls selling textiles, clothing and other artefacts made with fabrics. Overall, this market is one of the most colourful in Latin America and recalls the famous market of Chichicastenango in Guatemala, although on a smaller scale (by the way, it is said that some of the products on sale here come from Guatemala). The items on sale are very beautiful, often exceptionally beautiful, and the prices are definitely moderate; bargaining is considered an acceptable practice, and this contributes to reducing the prices. As an example, I bought a marvellous woollen ski-cap and a pair of woollen gloves; both were hand-knitted, both were made with a very large amount of high-quality wool, and the asked price was 100 Pesos only (about 5 US $); I didn\\u2019t have the nerve of bargaining ! The discerning traveller will certainly find very interesting the human environment of this market. Sellers are all women of indio descent; they are generally dressed in their traditional embroidered costumes and, in addition to selling their goods, they perform an impressive number of other tasks, like knitting, embroidering, taking care of their children and, if it is the case, even breast-feeding a newborn. Taking pictures in the market is advised against; especially taking pictures of people.\\n\\nAdjoining the church there is a convent, which contains a museum of the Mayan textile: admission is on payment; I have not visited it. In the same building there is also a large shop selling beautiful textiles and claiming to be a cooperative of local artisans. The items on sale are mostly embroidered blouses or embroidered cushion covers: they are definitely very beautiful, sometimes exceptionally beautiful; but the standardization of their design, the faultless precision of their weaving and the great number of identical items present in the store gives the feeling that they are machine-made.

Both inside and out there is much to dwell on--the baroque facade presents a crazy quilt of architectural and sculptural detail and the piece de resistance is the interior sequence of gilded retablos combining architecture, painting and sculpture.

You can see the double-headed eagle from the reign of the Hapsburg emperor Carlos V on the facade, together with a profusi\\u00f3n of faces, flowers and baroque leaves. The inside is no less ornate, with gold leaf brightening the carved wooden panels on the walls and an elaborate pulpit..  Only the main altar is strangely austere, with many local legends explaining what might have happened to the original altarpiece. What is most moving about this spot, however, is its life. The atmosphere you breathe here is of faith and community participation. Zinacantecan indigenous people in traditional dress create sumptuous floral bowers for the principal saints on their feast days and entone chants in their Mayan language, accompanied by rustic harps, guitars and violins. Townspeople from all social classes share the space with the occasional dog looking for a quiet space to meditate or pray.  There are two masses every weekday, at 7 a.m. and again at 7 p.m., and 4 on Sundays (7.30 and 11 a.m., then at 1.00 and 7:30 p.m.), usually so full that it is hard to find seating. During Holy Week the Dominican priests, successors to the illustrious Dominican bishop Bartolom\\u00e9 de Las Casas, organized processions of silence and dramatic reenactments of the crucifixi\\u00f3n, with so many parishioners attending that at times there isn\\'t even space to fit another person standing up!

It is not enough with seeing a 90 year old on a wheelchair but still they have to see the id. \\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Museo del Ambar", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/70/b4/aa/museo-del-ambar.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Diego de Mazariegos S/N Parque de La Merced, Chiapas", "addressLocality": "San Cristobal de las Casas", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29240", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "482174881": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Good if you\\'d like to learn the difference between real and fake ambar.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150802-d536289-Reviews-Museo_del_Ambar-San_Cristobal_de_las_Casas_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/70/b4/aa/museo-del-ambar.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The museum is not very large but the displays are well placed and informative.

The museum covers the origins, history, extraction, polishing and carving of amber in an interesting and concise way. They have around 300 -350 pieces of amber that you can admire, some with magnifying glasses or loupes so you can appreciate the insects inside or the finely carved details. They have a short video presentation that shows the polishing and carving of the pieces that they have for sale in the museum store. Some people on TA  have remarked that the lighting was inadequate, but I feel it lends a certain warm, amber glow to the whole exhibit and rather liked it. I was never told about not taking pictures and took a few. The museum is located in the Ex-Convento de la Merced, the convent was founded by 4 Mercedarian friars in 1537. Then after being abandoned in 1859 it was used as military quarters, then as a municipal jail from 1963 to 1993.

There is a short video that among other things provides very helpful tips on what to look for and what to avoid when buying amber products. Decent Spanish is needed to really enjoy the exhibits and the video but the language challenged and especially kids will find some of the larger amber pieces on display fascinating- specially those that contain fossilised insects.

Although he was a bit cranky initially, having inadvertently flung his thermometer into the depths of the garden or perhaps high into a tree, he was/is obviously passionate about this project and generous with his knowledge. Cisco was also helpful and offered interesting information about San Crist\\u00f3bal De Las Casas and Chiapas in general. It is most unusual to be encouraged to touch plants and to step into garden beds in order to inhale the exquisite fragrance of a particular orchid. There is so much to see and yet it is a calming experience. The trails are beautifully constructed with railings, fences and sculptures made from found materials. The second greenhouse is quite different from the first and equally as fascinating. There are two swings which are a joy to use. I\\'m a rather small person and the height of the swing gave me a new vantage point for viewing. We walked through the grounds in one direction then returned along the same route which gave us the opportunity to see things we had not noticed the first time. Everywhere you look there is something incredible to see. Some of it is exceedingly small which makes it all the more fun. We explored the grounds for three hours and if not for hunger would have lingered much longer. We walked to the site from Barrio del  Cerrillo which took half an hour at a painfully slow pace. The route we took was not terribly interesting though. The entrance fee to the site is 40 pesos which is the best bargain in San Crist\\u00f3bal de Las Casas. Whether you are interested in plants or just want a peaceful spot to enjoy what the earth has to offer us, I encourage you to visit OM.

The native forests of the central highlands of this part of Mexico are a mixed oak and conifer forest, and every tree on the grounds has branches laden with orchids and bromeliads, many in bloom.  The diversity of species is huge; everything from tiny twig epiphytes to sprawling Schomburgkias.  The greenhouse for warm growing species is packed with salvaged branches covered with epiphytes.  Aside from a major orchid show, I have never seen such numbers or variety of  orchid species in bloom in one place.  A three hour visit did not do the place justice.  Besides orchids and bromeliads, the collection includes a wide range of salvaged plants from other families, for example carnivorous butterworts and native fuschias.\\n     If you find yourself in Chiapas, I strongly recommend spending some time in San Crist\\u00f3bal de Las Casas, and schedule a day in Jard\\u00edn de Orqu\\u00eddeas Moxviquil.

While I have seen other \\'orchid reserves\\' established to preserve orchid habitat in small patches of forest, this is the first reserve I have ever seen set up to rescue salvaged plants from logging in an entire region and cultivate them for conservation, education, and research.  This botanical garden was established in 1994 as the brain child of \\u2018Cisco\\u2019 Craig Dietz, an American ex pat permanently living in San Christobal and the Director of the ORQUIDEAS MOXVIQUIL.

My wife and I have an extra special connection to OM and would like to share our story hoping that those who read this will visit and experience the wonder and beauty that influenced our lives.  Our first visit was in 2010 during a volunteer stay in San Cristobal de las Casas.  We discovered OM, met Cisco, and discussed a latrine building project for the site.  We frequented OM often over a four month period and spent a lot of time surrounded by blooming orchids, beautiful scenery, and creatively crafted landscapes.  Although we weren\\u2019t able to see the latrine project be completed while we were there, we began to appreciate orchids on an entirely new level thanks to Cisco\\u2019s passion and delicate care for these magnificent plants.  We were touched so deeply by the time spent at OM we decided that if we were to have a daughter in the future- we would name her Orchid.  In 2013 we found out that we were going have a baby girl.  Sadly, during labor we lost our precious baby Orchid.  Devastated and lost we felt there was only one way to honor her.  We returned to San Cristobal de las Casas in June of 2014 to spread our daughter\\u2019s ashes where she first entered into our consciousness- Orquideas Moxviquil.  Cisco welcomed us and our family members with open arms and we held a beautifully personal ceremony in the greenhouse for our little Orchid.  We feel that our little girl now lives on and grows through the unique expressions that only orchids are able.  Knowing others hear of her short but beautiful life also helps us feel as though she lives on.  Like sparking embers she lives on through beautiful moments of when her story is shared by entering into the minds of those who learn of her.  I hope you feel the love that is encompassed at Orquideas Moxviquil we certainly do and we plan to visit as often as possible.

It would be so wonderful to be able to get coffee and sit in the garden observing the world wake!\\n\\nDOWNSIDES: NO one we asked seemed to know about it. Dont let this stop you!!! You can walk  one way but would recommend you collectivo or taxi back (I walked both ways and was pretty tired when I got home!) Head north along General Utrilla (which runs alongside the Catedral) Walk passed the artists markets then past the chaotic public markets continue on you will go past furniture makers, butchers, mechanics then last the Museum of Mayan Medicine continue to the very end of General Utrilla. At the end of the road turn right, OM is about 5-10 mins walk form that corner on the left. You will see it and its wonderful bridges!\\n\\nCongrats to the director for building a true peace of paradise for the local people to be educated on their most magical plant life!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Orquideas Moxviquil", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/24/4c/bf/orquideas-moxviquil-om.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Periferico Norte #4 Ojo de Agua", "addressLocality": "San Cristobal de las Casas", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29200", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "119536808": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Wonderful place!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150802-d946031-Reviews-Orquideas_Moxviquil-San_Cristobal_de_las_Casas_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/24/4c/bf/orquideas-moxviquil-om.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Experience some of Chiapas natural wonders in a very easy access way.

It was not publicized anywhere online or in any brochure at that time, and I heard about it via the owner of a B&amp;B where I stayed as I passed through San Cristobal de las Casas.   At that time it was simply a tranquil place that I enjoyed for an afternoon hike, with trees along walk paths chock-full of transplanted wild orchids and with many flowers and native plants freshly planted along  numerous under-construction walk paths.  I found this place was to someday become Orchideas Moxviquil (pronounced for me, or-kee-dee-us  mosh-va-keel ) a wild orchid and nature preserve.\\n\\nThen earlier this year I decided to return wanting to spend more time in one area I enjoyed most on my earlier journey, the state of Chiapas and in particular San Cristobal de las Casas.  I visited this time during early March for a three week stay and while further exploring the city I decided to head back to the garden.  The garden resided on the \\u201cPeriferico Norte\\u201d which means the north side of town on the loop that surrounds the city.   Back then and even on my most recent visit, the place is pretty obscure and hidden even though it is right next to the highway.   The only thing that marked it on my most recent visit was a sandstone looking half-rounded dome shaped building that is the green house.  Well probably a good thing I thought later as this place will like have a lot of people if it ever gets advertised.\\n\\nTo get there is probably a cab ride if coming from the central tourist areas for most, and certainly for me had I not been walking for the past couple of months but with all the exercise one gets in Mexico I decided to just walk there since I had been lucky enough to secure detailed English directions.  I simply needed to head north on the street of (?) Utrilla (north extension of Insurgentes) and at the end of it, turn left at the loop.   Then about a quarter mile on the right is the garden.\\n\\nMy how this place had changed!  I had not seen construction move this fast in my own country and certainly not in Mexico.   As I entered I caught up with a group of school children that was being taken through the facility with several teachers.   I watched and tried to brush up on my limited Spanish.  I made out the matter of ecology and proper handling of trash being discussed and what this meant to the environment, as well as a lecture on the types of plants and orchids indigenous to Chiapas that filled the new green house and lined the walkways.  (Side note \\u2013 remarkable the work that is being done now regarding education on protecting the environment in Mexico, addressed where it counts, with the kids.)  \\n\\nI was delighted to get the unique privilege of hearing a presentation at \\u201cmy level\\u201d given to these grade-schoolers but the smiles on their faces and genuine excitement as they walked through the place were the true reward here.  Well about 30 kids were there and gone before I knew it and mostly off and on from then, just a tourist here and there as I had the place mostly to myself.  \\n\\nNow I would call out San Cristobal de las Casas as being one of the furthest away culturally from my normal Dallas life and as far as one can get while traveling within the shortest distance (well if you discount East Texas ;-).   But walking through this garden allowed me to move back to somewhere that was well off bounds from both the suburban sameness I had left behind and the Maya historical time machine where I had landed.   Nature it seems uniquely speaks to all of us in a calming fashion, providing an escape from it all and this area had been carefully and subtlety crafted to enhance that tranquility.  \\n\\nAs I walked I found an amphitheater carved out of earth, and walkways galore as I passed what seemed like every type of plant and flower that grew in the state.   Down new trails were recently stocked cascading ponds that were bio-balanced enough to be clear and supporting all kinds of aquatic life.   I got so lost at one point as to stop and watch the protocol of insects sparing and mating on the small rocks by the waterside.   There were tadpoles schooling and frogs croaking.  The sides of the ponds were populated with multiple varieties of indigenous grasses.  The flowers along the walk paths were beautiful and picturesque and the amount of plants that existed in the greenhouse made me believe for a moment I was in the middle of a jungle, well in all fairness a paved and comfortable one, but still quite pleasurable.  \\n\\nI can\\u2019t begin to describe all the varieties of plants in the humid and jungle-like greenhouse or the beautiful small ponds that were inside (ponds and a local habitat water reproduction in a greenhouse are an oddity but certainly enhance the experience).  I am no botanist, but all I can say this thing was an absolute delight.  If you somehow arrive outside the normal business hours of the greenhouse, be doubly sure to check the schedule and return when it is open for touring.\\n\\nAfter my tour of the greenhouse and as I walked about, I ran into the main overseer of the project, Cisco Dietz and two businessmen who were discussing a contribution so I didn\\u2019t want to interrupt but later returned and spoke with Cisco where I commended him on how the project had improved and I let him know I hadn\\u2019t seen anything this nature centric in a long time while I could only compare it to my own city\\u2019s Dallas World Aquarium.  \\n\\nI continued to explore the grounds until I discovered that late-afternoon was too late to begin a tour here and still see everything.  Added to that was realizing again that most mountain towns in Mexico (with San Cristobal seeming to be the highest and coldest) quickly remind me it gets a lot cooler in the evenings than this Texas boy has been nurtured to enjoy; so by sunset it  was time to head back to the hotel.  This time I cheated by skipping the walk back and flagging down a cab.  A buck and a half back to the city center \\u2013 not bad!\\n\\nTwo days before I planned to head back home in Dallas I decided to again walk outside of town to the gardens.  This time the only people there were a man and his family having a picnic on Sunday; very peaceful.  He spoke a little English and told me I should head on up the mountain for more trails.   I did so and as the walk paths became steeper it became more primitive.  Along the route I encountered evidence of the slow wheel-barrow and pick-axe type construction remnants that were remaining along the walkway from the previous week\\u2019s workers.  Their improvement efforts had moved above the lower planes and continued to progress.   It was a good feeling to see that the project was still underway, knowing how sometimes the wheels of bureaucracy can halt a really good idea here.   The trees along the paths well above the main grounds were still laced with a heavy population of wild orchids which continued as far as I ventured for the evening.   I never made it up to the top of the mountain in the backdrop but perhaps that is because I couldn\\u2019t get past the great scenery below to make it that far.  Maybe next visit!\\n\\nAs I planned my return to town I decided to brave walking down to where I had seen some city buses stopping.  Once again practicing my bad Spanish, \\u201cCiudad Central\\u201d I quizzed (boy am I a Spanish master ;-)   Si, was the response and the total cost of the day\\u2019s excursion ended up being around twenty five cents - a free walk down from tourist central, a cheap bus fare back to the city center and a short walk to my hotel.  Not bad!  Well I must confess it cost a little more than that because I couldn\\u2019t resist making a contribution to this great effort.  Look for the walk path I can only call \\u201ccontribution tile isle\\u201d and see the one marked \\u201cDon &amp; Kathey\\u201d on the walkway, then for fun send me a photo of it with you in the photo and I\\u2019ll put it up on my blog-site.  I am certain they would appreciate a contribution from you too and in the process you can become famous like me.  http://orchidsmexico.com/index.php", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Orquideas Moxviquil", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/24/4c/bf/orquideas-moxviquil-om.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Periferico Norte #4 Ojo de Agua", "addressLocality": "San Cristobal de las Casas", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29200", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "70412560": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "orquideas moxviquil- not to be missed", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150802-d946031-Reviews-Orquideas_Moxviquil-San_Cristobal_de_las_Casas_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/24/4c/bf/orquideas-moxviquil-om.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "this very unique jardin outside the hustle and bustle of the center of san cristobal is an evolving jewel. with one greenhouse completed, and two more  to be under construction, you get to see bromeliads and orchids like you\\'ve never experienced them before. &quot;rescued&quot; from felled trees or found fallen in the woods in the chiapas highlands, some of these plants are familiar and some i have never seen before. it\\'s an extraordinary undertaking. when we were there,  a native mushroom walkway was beginning, as was the area for the traditional mayan medicinal plants. with cisco deitz as your guide, you will learn so much and be ignited by his passion about the jardin. this is really a must see!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Orquideas Moxviquil", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/24/4c/bf/orquideas-moxviquil-om.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Periferico Norte #4 Ojo de Agua", "addressLocality": "San Cristobal de las Casas", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29200", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "67271140": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Absolutely illuminating", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150802-d946031-Reviews-Orquideas_Moxviquil-San_Cristobal_de_las_Casas_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/24/4c/bf/orquideas-moxviquil-om.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I went hiking with my friends to the Moxviquil reserve and it was truly wonderful.

The only other museum/inn like this is the Mayan Inn in Chichicastenango, Guatemala, with a similar history of some 80 years.  Since the 1950s, a meeting place for anthropologists from UChicago, Stanford and Harvard (the latter continued studying the Tzotzil Maya, mostly nearby Zinacantan, for another 20+ years under Dr. Evon Vogt).  The library hold copies of most of those works generated (though much thinned out since the 90s) and the Bloms\\u00b4 photo collection is housed here.  Artists-in-residence left works over the years.  Rooms are quaint, with blankets and fireplaces for cold Chiapas nights, photos and attire from different Indian towns in the Highlands. Generations of visitors have left behind reading material in each room.  Franz (died 1963) and Gertrude \\u201cTrudi\\u201d (Duby) Blom (died 1993) shared their home, with the grande dame heading the table at mealtimes.  Mostly European and American visitors, industrialists, visiting Lacandon Indians (with Swiss table manners!) and staff partook in the nutritious food from the gardens.  Visitors over the years have included umpteen students, film crews, Henry Kissenger, Diego Rivera, Fran\\u00e7ois Mitterand, and members of the royal family of Denmark.  The small Lacandon and local Moxviquil museums are worth the visit.

When I was there in 2005 three Indians in native garb joined us for  breakfast  and conversation around a fireplace in the beautiful dining room. (There is always a place for them at Na-Bolom when they need to come to town) \\n\\nThe city is high in the mountains and can be cold when you are out of the sun in January. But each room at Na-Bolom has a fireplace and a nice man brings a wheel-barrow full of wood for it each morning. We took a day tour to several nearby villages (Zinacatan &amp; San Juan Chapula ...home of the Zapitistes) where we learned about and experienced the local culture. Simply fantastic. \\n\\nAt Na-Bolom my friend and I  were able to hire a car and driver for $240 each to take us on a 3-day trip into the jungle. The driver was a wonderful young family man, spoke some English and was very much interested in improving. So our trip was also a moving classroom for both he and I. Went to Palenque, Aqua Azul, Misol-Ha, Bonampak, etc. We stayed in a cabin at the edge of a native village one night, were taken up the Rio Usamacintas, the river separating Mexico and Guatemala,  to the remote ruins at  Yaxchilan. Maybe best of all, we got to take a walk in the jungle for as long as we liked. I loved every bit of it. (I was 77) \\n\\nOf course bring a camera, good walking shoes, clothes for hot days but don\\'t bother much about the cold. Buy a heavy wool sweater like the natives wear in the local market for about $18. You should plan to be in San Cristobal de las Casas for about a week to enjoy all there is to see and do.

The elevation in San Cristobal was already high and I was feeling the effects (lightheaded, headache), so I took my time climbing them and stopped for breaks to catch my breath.\\n\\nI finally made it to the top where there were fantastic views of the city below. The church was pretty and surrounded by a forest. There were some picnic benches and a washroom at the top too. It was a peaceful place and I enjoyed relaxing there and taking in the views. \\n\\nOn the way down the steps, there were a group of young local men sitting on the steps at the bottom and I was the only tourist around at midday, which resulted in some uncomfortable cat-calling for me.

First you go to Comitan (2 hours and 90 Pesos), take a taxi to the collectivos to Las Margaritas (5 minutes and 35 Pesos) . From Las Margeritas (to Las Margeritas it\\u2019s 20 minutes and around 18 pesos) you just ask for the collectivos to Emiliano Zapata (5 hours and 105 Pesos). Than you have to walk around 2 hours and you are in heaven. I can recommend to do the walk in the afternoon or in the morning, otherwise it will be very hard. There is drinking water so you don\\u2018t need to bring this with you. A fire is always burning and the men who work there are really nice. (There are always 2 around). You can cook there on the fireplace. Bring anti insect spray, flashlight and rubbish bags for sure. The walk is fun because you never know how it will be. My tip: bring rubber boots, than you are very safe of the mud. I would recommend 1 full day to get there and 3 full days there and 1 for the travel back. It\\u2018s the paradise on earth but you have to like the nature. There are a lot of animals and thousands of insects. In the night you hear frogs and monkeys, sometimes very noisy.

We travelled to Miramar from Comit\\u00e1n, where we stayed overnight. We visited El Chiflon that day, which I also recommend. First you need to get collectivo from Comitan to Las Margaritas which was around 20 pesos per person. From where you have to take collectivo to Emiliano Zapata. Try to arrive to Las Margaritas early, because the journey  takes around 5 hours. Also talk to the drive to take you to centro turistico in Emiliano Zapata, because most collectivos end up in nearby village of San Quintin The road was asphalted from the beginning turning into a really rugged road later. When we arrived to the turistic center it was around 2 pm. In earlier reviews people write it is impossible to go after noon to Laguna, because guides want to get home early. They told us it was possible to go and we also had a guide. Try to leave your unnecessary things at centro turistico, the journey to the lake was really difficult Ask El presidente about the road conditions and availability of drinking water in the camp. He told us there is drinking water, but there was none. So carry a water filter or some stove to boil your water. We rented a pair of rubber boots as El presidente told us there is some mud on the road. So we started our trip around 14:30 pm with our guide, we followed the river heading west from the village and crossed a foot bridge. Then the mud field started, there was not some mud, but a lot of blood, which the local expressed in spanish by &quot;mucho lodo&quot;. I will never forget these words :). The path was really difficult and mud overwhelming. We carried a lot of food for three days, 4 liters of water, 1 liter of tequila, small tent for two, sleeping pads, silk sleeping bags and a lot of warm clothes. We were worried that it will be cold at the lake, but it was really nice. I thing that temperatures during the night dont drop below 15 Celsius. So the weather at he lake was warm. With that load our trip to the lake took us more than 4 hours. Our guide left us at 1 hour after we set off and told us to follow the signs. There was so much mud on the road that we got stuck in it many times. We still reached the camp after sunset, totally exhausted. We jumped into the warm water and washed away the mud and sweat. We spend two beutiful nights there. We went took the guided canoe tour to Tres Islas and spotted fish and turtles on the way. In the afternoon we swam to the Turtle cave. On the way back the local camp security told us to take the quicker path follwing the water pipeline. So the way back took only 2 hours. There was still a lot of mud &quot;mucho lodo&quot; :). We arrived to the village around 2 pm and planned to go by collectivo to Occosingo. The collectivos leave Sun Quintin until noon so we had to wait for the midnight one, which was not classic collectivo, but truck. So we travelled on the hull.

Firstly by a 20 minute colectivo bus to Las Magaritas (every 15 minutes or so), and then a five hour colectivo bus from there. The ride was not so bad as the first half was asphalt.

On arrival in Emiliano Zapata the bus dropped us at the cabins where we were met by the tourism committee, they explained the services on offer and prices. The cabins were clean with electricity and got solar showers (in toilet block). The lake is about1.5 hours walk away. At the lake there is no formal accommodation, only tent (which we rented), or hammock. There are guardians there 24 hours a day. Prices as of Feb 2014: cabin 120 MX pp, small tent for two people 150MX per night,  3 hour canoe tour with guide (two options available, both great) 300 MX per canoe, daily lake fee 40 MX.

There are government agency offices, regular businesses and trendy shops as well as residences in the buildings in the area. We considered it a safe area in which to walk. \\n\\nThe Serjeo Casro museum is many things, as much about the collector as the collected. It is a by-product of more than 50 years of dedicated and largely unpaid work with the indigenous peoples of this area by a humantarian.\\u00a0 The most prominent pieces on display are the 30 + authentic traditional ceremonial and formal garments worn by each of the tribal groups of Maya descent in the south western part of Mexico and northern Guatemala. There are also cultural artifacts from these groups and the Spanish community that has\\u00a0 been overwhelming these peoples during the last 500 years.

This sort of help is something which they would be unlikely able to afford without him.  Donations by visitors will aid in this work and to preserve the unique collection in this museum.  We have travelled many, many places in Mexico, Central and South America and seldom met such a genuine, authentic and humble humanitarian..  Usually people like Sergeo are those one reads about or sees a documentary on, not someone one sits and chats to about a life well lived.  If you want to verify this, there are many articles and several documentaries which have been made about him which you can pull up on the web.\\n\\nWe were referred to this museum by a guide (Cesar) who had provided us with a small group (6) five hour tour of two Indigenous communities.

I visited today (Monday, 1/27/14) with a friend from my hostel. We took a cab for 30 pesos. The cab driver knew the place and how to get there. I suggest you bring a water bottle, your camera, sunblock, closed toed shoes, and maybe a light backpack if you want to go on a hike.\\n\\nThe grounds are lovely gardens and ponds reflecting Chiapan environs. Lowlands, highlands, etc. They are also undergoing improvement, including a new greenhouse to display more orquids and epiphytes (epiphytes are non-parasitic plants that live on the bark of other trees). We started our visit with a nice 2.2 km (that\\'s about a mile and a quarter) hike up on to the hillside above the site.  It goes uphill then downhill through a forest. There is also a cave you can peer into at the top. The trail is well maintained and signposted.\\n\\nAfterwards we went into the epiphyte greenhouse (orquedera) with Cisco, the American godfather of the site. He told us a bit about the site, its history, and taught us about epiphytes (orquids are epiphytes). He is very friendly and it seems that he takes time to educate every guest that arrives.\\n\\nThe price for the hike and greenhouse is 50 pesos. Either one on its own is 30 pesos. There are also volunteer opportunities available to help this non-for-profit site.

Collectivos run regularly on this road.\\nEntrance costs 30 pesos per person. A small leaflet in English describes the 2.5-kilometer circular hike which climbs steeply up the northern side of Cerro Huitepec all through forest. The trail has wooden-supported steps up steeper sections and several simple wooden shelters. Birds are the only wildlife I saw in this small reserve, but there are a variety of tree, plant, and orchid species.\\nFor the adventurous and fit it is possible to hike a small trail, which starts from the shelter at the highest part of the reserve, and continues up the ridge with a steep downhill section before climbing to the top of Cerro Huitepec. This trail is about 3 or 4 kilometers in length and stays on the ridge to the top. It is longer and more strenuous than the reserve trail which gives access to it, but the forest and views are better than in the lower reserve.\\nThere is a clearing with two piles of stones on the summit which is higher than the nearby peak with antenae on it. It is the highest peak in the region with good views for long distances through forest clearings.\\nCerro Huitepec is an extinct volcano with good soil, so its slopes are farmed by indigenous smallholders almost to the summit.\\nThe peak with the antenae, which towers above San Cristobal, can be climbed by a concrete road. However, the area with antenae on top is fenced off, although there are still spectacular views over San Cristobal.\\nThe small road leads down through farmland on the southeast slopes of Cerro Huitepec and becomes a maze of roads, tracks and trails. It\\'s necessary to ask the friendly indigenous locals for the way back to San Cristobal, which is walkable. Otherwise a collectivo or taxi may be available.\\nAllow 5 or 6 hours for the complete summit hike from San Cristobal.

We walked through town, out of the central tourist area of town, throught the traditional markets (for residents not tourists) and arrived at the small museum.  It has displays of both historical and current mayan beliefs about illness and health, heavily influenced by the jungle plants and mayan belief systems. Part of the museum\\'s purpose is to document and explain these practices and how they fit into the mayan culture but also to support the maintenance of these practices, which in some cases co-exist w/ the more modern health care practices. The main entry room portrays the importance of childbirth with a video of a traditional birth (dar la luz) with the role of the mother and the partera (midwife) and the significance of various practices to promote the physical and spiriutal health of the baby and the mother. Other displays explained the various dimensions of health and the practitioners who guide these areas-shaman, huesero (bones\\u2014a chiropracter?), botanical medicines, partera, etc. It is a very modest museum but also very informative and worth a visit for those interested in mayan beliefs handed down through time and how those beliefs and practices are beingrecovered and restored even today.  The last room in the museum changes gears and talks about how the forests and indigenous practices have been and are being ripped off by multinational pharamceutical companies. it is very critical of researchers who have come to the mayan (and other indigenous regions like the amazonia) lands in the name of research but who have ended up &quot;stealing\\' traditional planys and practices and trying to patent these natural resouces and the traditional environmental knowledge of mayan medicine. The final exhibit before exiting into a small botanical garden w/ plants of medicinal value and uses, is a list of those universities and pharamceutical companies (&quot;bio-pirates&quot; they are called) which are called out for engaging in these practices and trying to make money from plants or chemical agents they\\'ve been able to isolate in the mayan jungles and mayan natural botanical \\npatrimony.  The museumalso houses a pharmacy of traditional medicines and hosts classes and trainings (in spanish and mayan dialects of the chiapas region) for those wishing to learn and maintain traditional Mayan healing knowledge and techniques.

The information is interesting but the museum is very basic, five rooms that represent the main types of healers. \\nThere used to be a botanical garden that has been completely forgotten and now houses few medicinal plants with barely legible signs. There is a central healing house active with healing practices and filled with patients :) and the herbal pharmacy with the herbal house next door, where you can see the herbs in various stages of drying and there is a lot of packaging going on as well.\\nI believe the people there do not speak english, but they are very friendly and keen on explaining and answering every question.

Then you pass thru several rooms set-up to depict a religious service, a mid-wife working with an expectant mother scene and some crafts being made.  In the back there are photographs of local medicinal herbs (with descriptions in Spanish only) and outside there is a garden with many of these herbs and a sweat lodge.
