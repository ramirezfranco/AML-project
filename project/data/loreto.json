They\\'ve spruced up the Marina area and put up statues, displays, etc so people could take pictures. Everyone in our group wanted a picture in front of the large multi-colored &quot;LORETO&quot; sign. Enjoy a pleasant walk on the Malecon after a nice meal. The people are friendly, the sights impressive, and you will feel more a part of Loreto!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Malecon", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/66/22/73/malecon.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Loreto", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "504197100": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "PEOPLE WATCHING AT ITS BEST", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150772-d151774-Reviews-Malecon-Loreto_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/66/22/73/malecon.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "locals venture out in the evenings for exercise and just relaxing.

I cannot speak enough for their hospitality. They listened to what we wanted to do and made recommendations for the trip. We snorkeled and saw an amazing variety of fish in Crystal clear water. The crew was able to fish along the way (ask about tacking on your fishing permit) and catch some fantastic fish. If you\\'re lucky you can land Mahi. We saw the sea lions and the blue foots before we continued onto the beach where we had a cooler of soda and water with lunch prepared. We swam and snorkeled at the beach and saw more fish (parrot, angel, trigger, grouper and a star fish) including a large school of fish. There were manta rays peppered throughout the bay too. After leaving we had dolphins swimming past the boat. If you want the ULTIMATE experience, ask about the amazing restaurant on the beach that you get to by boat where they will prepare your fresh fish the way you like it while staring over the beautiful water.

He is a local and is very knowledgeable about the area, the sea life and fauna and flora of the area and surrounding islands.  He is also very concerned about the environment and maintaining the bay in pristine condition and even stopped the boat several times to pick up trash that was floating.  \\nWe started out by meeting up with a large school of dolpins and he allowed us to interact with them for quite awhile and told us the best spot to sit to get great photos.  We then went around Coronado island and he pointed out different formations and told us the history and ecology of the area and animals on the islands. No one but me wanted to snorkel so I did not want to make everyone wait for me however snorkeling is definitely part of the tour and I would recommend doing it as the water clarity and sea life are amazing in the area.  We ended the day with a nice hour of beach time on Coronado island with some for the clearest water and beautiful white sand beach!  I did snorkel in this area and was able to see flounder, eels, starfish, and lots of juvenile fish.  \\nPlenty of beer, soda, water, and box lunch for the 4+ hr tour \\nCall Captain Rammses for an unforgettable day.

The tour operators you select make it a trip of a lifetime or a waste of time. First the bad: Anything to do with the Danzante development is a sales pitch for timeshares despite what they tell you. Tours provided by them are usually a disappointment. They promised me a discounted scuba trip then upon arrival at the development, that never materialized. I was shuttled from one salesman to another until I demanded my return trip back to Loreto. THE GOOD STUFF: Dolphin Dive is locally-owned by caring, competent professionals who have become good friends. They provide scuba and snorkel trips year round, seasonal whale watching, No fishing (better to watch than kill), and will do land tours upon request and when the weather prevents water sports. Rafa also will meet custom requests for hiking and kayaking. He is a lifetime Loretan and knows EVERYTHING and EVERYONE in the area. He is a Baja Sur Travel Advisor-not an official title but just because of what he knows. Drop in and talk if nothing else. Blue Nation is new in town, but has very high standards for their eco-friendly scuba and snorkeling trips. Yago has world-wide scuba and snorkeling experience and has made a superb effort to learn the area and islands. He and Moni are very helpful and friendly. Once you pick your tour operator, you have the opportunity to see dolphins, fish, whales, fish, mobila, fish, bullseye electric rays, morey eels, bird life, fantastic views, nudibranches, and lots of kinds of fish. Enjoy! And wear shoes to go into the water from the sandy beaches.

The name we both decided on was Said  (pronounced saw-eed)  When we arrived in Loreto he sent me an email to confirm but to also say that it would be windy on the day we had picked for the tour so he suggested another day.  We went with his advice and he was SO-O-O right. :-)  All the other days were windy with choppy water but our day turned out to be perfect.  We had one of the nicer boats and a captain named Edie who took us out and around Coronado Island.  We parked on one side and took the short hike/walk across the island to the main bay.  Then we went back to the boat and circled the island and saw flocks of birds, lots of dolphins (two different kinds) and sea lions.  Then Said to us to a smaller beach that was lovely with only one other group there  (the main beach was PACKED) so it was almost like having the beach to ourselves.  Then Said, his friend Leslie, and Edie set up a canopy and served us an amazing lunch of homemade ceviche, guacamole and a salad.  They offered juice, water, and even beer.  We relaxed in the shade while lunch was prepared and then took a nice walk on the beach.  Did I mention what a beautiful day it was?  Just perfect.  We talked with several other couples during our stay and while they were happy with their tours, they paid considerably more than we did AND they didn\\'t get that amazing lunch on the beach.

I would just choose a different company to go with. \\n\\nWe used Desert and Sea Expeditions for this trip and had a very disappointing experience. While we had a better experience, with a different guide and captain, on another of their trips, the organizational issues with the company itself caused problems and led us to have expectations of the captain that were not fulfilled.\\n\\nWhen we first went to get information, there were two people on staff, a man and a woman. We spoke primarily with the woman, and the information she provided, her responsiveness to our questions, and her warm personality caused us to choose this company after gathering information from several. When we returned to make reservations, she wasn\\u2019t there and we dealt only with the man (manager or owner?). We talked in a combination of English and Spanish, since his English was not better than our Spanish, as far as we could tell. However, some things we understood fairly clearly: The first trip we wanted to take was a snorkeling trip to Coronado Island, and we had been advised that a specific spot (by the rock called \\u201cSnoopy\\u201d) was the best place to snorkel, and he made it abundantly clear that we could do that, in fact, that the boat would be at our disposal to do whatever we wanted during the time of the excursion; we also asked about the need for wet suits, and he replied that \\u201cIt depends. Sometimes you need them, sometimes not.\\u201d We understood this to mean that we could decide at the time of the trip, depending on conditions. At no time did he suggest that we would need to reserve the wet suits in advance.\\n\\nIn the brochure that the company provides about this specific trip \\u201cD\\u00eda de paseo a Isla Coronado,\\u201d it states that \\u201cLa expedici\\u00f3n incluye: . . . Gu\\u00eda capit\\u00e1n experimentado, equipo para hacer esn\\u00f3rkel.\\u201d My understanding of Spanish is that \\u201cexperimentado\\u201d does not mean \\u201cexperimental,\\u201d but \\u201cexperienced.\\u201d This statement led us to expect the captain to act as an experienced guide and also that snorkeling equipment (including wet suits) would be provided.\\n\\nThere were three groups of clients on the boat. One group spoke only English. One group spoke French and Spanish. We spoke English, French, and some Spanish. The captain of the boat, Enrique, was fine as a driver of the boat. He did that and passed out lunch (simple sandwiches) and cold drinks. He didn\\u2019t really give any instructions or information in either English or Spanish. He didn\\u2019t provide anything remotely resembling \\u201cguiding.\\u201d He didn\\u2019t provide any options or choices. Because of the different groups (total of 10 passengers), we did not have a coordinated plan or request for him. My husband was able to share a little history and geology of the Marine Sanctuary and the islands based on a kayaking trip he had taken with another company that provided an excellent guide (in addition to the boat captain that took the kayaks out to the area where they were going to kayak). To be fair, the costs through that company were significantly higher. \\n\\nFirst, we discovered that while one group had reserved wet suits, those were the only wet suits on board. There was no option for the rest of us to use wet suits. If you didn\\u2019t reserve them in advance, they were not on the boat. When we observed people from another boat snorkeling with sea lions, the group with the wet suits asked to stop there so they could snorkel. I joined in, without a wet suit (I\\u2019m pretty used to cold water), but the others in my party didn\\u2019t because of the cold water.\\n\\nNext, Enrique took us to a beautiful beach, where we stopped. He gave no information, not how long we would stay, not that we would have lunch there, nothing about where to snorkel, not that there was a trail (which my husband discovered and hiked ), not that there were restrooms at one end of the beach (which my husband discovered on the hike, but of which others were not aware). My husband and I snorkeled but saw little for most of the time, finally seeing one school of colorful fish. My grandson was more cautious due to the coldness of the water and mostly stayed near the beach, playing in the shallow water. I asked then about \\u201cSnoopy\\u201d rock, and Enrique said it was too late to go there since we had already passed it. (Okay, I should have made my request known at the outset, but I had told the owner or manager, and he was there when we got on the boat and conversed with Enrique; also, since there was never any discussion among the three groups about what each wanted, and no indication from Enrique that we had any choices, I never really felt there was an opening to do that.) \\n\\nWhile nothing could spoil the beauty of this island and beach, our purpose of seeing interesting and colorful fish while snorkeling was not met. I was very disappointed. Our reason for taking this excursion was snorkeling, and we were thwarted by the lack of wet suits and the limitations on where we snorkeled. (My husband and grandson saw many more fish from their kayaks and when snorkeling on the kayak trip I\\u2019ve mentioned with a different company.) The promises extended by the company were not met.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Loreto Bay National Marine Park", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/7a/3a/a9/photo1jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Loreto", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "561399919": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "beautiful and interesting", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150772-d152201-Reviews-Loreto_Bay_National_Marine_Park-Loreto_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/7a/3a/a9/photo1jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "we took a zodiac day trip through this absolutely breathtaking and beautiful marine park. so very nice seeing whales, dolphins, snorkeling and birds in the area.

It was around an hours ride across calm blue water. Very bracing!We first dived just to the north of the colony on a deep set of rocky steps going down to around 40 -45 metres 130 -140 feet. We had very good visibility around 20 metres( 60 feet) horizontal. There was a superb black coral forest which had  bright yellow feeding polyps giving the appearance of a beautiful bright yellow forest. There was a reasonable amount of fish , mainly fairly small although we were assured that at times it was possible to see the big groupers in that location. I could quite believe that and going from past experience in similar locations it was the lack of a current that diminished the amount of fish life we saw. I am sure had there been a current the numbers of fish would have been considerably more. However, there was plenty of life in warm clear current free water to make it a very pleasant and interesting dive. On the surface the rock formations of the island are stunning and our second dive of the day on the sea lion colony showed that these formations continued under the sea. The interaction with the sea lions was wonderful as they showed an interest is coming to see us and also went through a whole bunch of acrobatic movements right there infant of us. Although we were scuba diving there is plenty of opportunity for snorkelers to see and interact with the sea lions and even if you don\\'t go into the water at all there is still plenty of animal life to be seen.

But there were some problems as well.   The water was full of long, thin jelly-fish with the appearance of stings of pearls about 2-3 mm in diameter and perhaps up to a meter or more in length - and they sting.   So we could not snorkel when and where we wanted to.  On Isla Carmen were were inundated by pesky black flies - they did not bite but they did distract from our enjoyment of our hike across to Bahia Salinas .   As well, on Isla Carmen there was a sign posted at Bahia Ballandra, a popular anchorage, stating that the land was off limits to hiking at it was licensed to hunting operations.   At Isla Coronado I snorkelled and when I returned to wash myself and my gear with fresh water we were swarmed by wasps seeking fresh water.   As well, in April the water can be chilly for swimming without a wet suit.    I will post a lovely photo showing the beauty of the sunset at Isla Carmen, but also another showing wasps on our snorkel gear as it soaks in water....

Bad weather prevented us from venturing out for the first 3 days, but on the 4th day, we got a break from the high winds and rough seas. Splurged on a private panga from the marina to Isla Coronado for a day trip. \\n\\nDespite the previous bad weather, the waters around the island were very clear and calm. On the way out saw many boats collecting chocolate clams. Stopped first to snorkel with the sea lions on the rocky far side of the island. Water crystal clear, a bit chilly in December but a shorty wetsuit was perfect. It was great fun swimming with the sea lions and watching beginning scuba divers take their first open water lesson below us in such excellent visibility. Next was a lunch stop at the north side beach, gorgeous soft white sand and stunning turquoise water.  Then some more snorkeling near the rocky shore next to the sand beach (oodles of fish, lost count of the different species). On our way back to the marina in the later afternoon, we ran into a HUGE pod of bottlenose dolphin, who delighted in racing our boat &amp; riding the bow wave just a few feet away - amazing memories of the sound of their underwater squeaks and breathing each time they broke the surface.

I had reserved a half day fishing trip that, due to illness, had to be postponed.  I did sign up for the sales pitch at the development they represent which gave me a $50 discount.  Property is beautiful, sales pitch fine including the free breakfast.  A day later when I talked to the Danzante folks about switching my deposit to a snorkeling trip, they said &quot;No Problem&quot;.  Arrived at the Marina at 8:00 AM sharp two days later and found our guide who spoke minimal English.  Snorkeling equipment consisted of three mask and snorkel sets that looked as if they had seen better days and one pair of fins for the two of us. Again, not in tip top shape to say the least.  But we agreed thinking we could share and there didn\\'t seem to be anything we could do about then anyway.  Heading out toward Coronado Island, our guide proceeded to do some electrical repairs to his boat and tended to his two fishing poles as we trolled slowly across the Sea of Cortez. In addition, the advertised lunch and promised cooer with ice were nowhere to be seen.    An hour later we had not reached the island when  a phone call came.  I was handed the phone and spoke to the caller from Danzante who asked if I minded if we returned to the marina to pick up two more snorkelers who\\'s boat, so the story went, was not working - about a 25 minute trip back to marina and then, presumably, another hour or so to whatever snorkeling site(s) we were supposed to be going to.  At which point I said yes but decided right then that I\\'d had quite enough of this trip.  When we returned to the marina we left much to the consternation of our guide and one of the operators on shore.  Maybe it was just a bad day for them.

Water visibility was 30-60 feet during this late July trip, which I understand improves in late August/ September to close to 100-120 feet.  Surface temps were 80-88 F with temps at 40 ft in the neighborhood of 72-80 F.  Coming from Seattle with water temps of 40-45F and visibility of 10-20 feet this was like heaven.  I wore a shorty wetsuit mostly to thwart the stings of noseeums and the tiny invisible jellyfish or plankton.  The kids wore full 3/2 wetsuits to help with core body temps during our 45-60 minute dives.\\n\\nThe most pristine and beautiful beaches of Loreto are found on the islands.  Consider a beach hopper trip or go to the Marina in the morning to catch a ride with a local fisherman to some of the best beaches.  The more popular ones have shade, white sand, a little outhouse, and are easy to access by panga with a 30-60 minute trip each way.\\n\\nOn our bucket list:  return to swim with dolphins, see the whales, see a whale shark, and see a seahorse (elusive masters of disguise!).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Loreto Bay National Marine Park", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/7a/3a/a9/photo1jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Loreto", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "135259455": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Gorgeous water and sea life", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150772-d152201-Reviews-Loreto_Bay_National_Marine_Park-Loreto_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/7a/3a/a9/photo1jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The sea life and water in this area are pristine.

The strong desire to survive was totally awe-inspiring. \\nThe mission itself was amazing, but we were equally impressed by the efforts of the early Jesuits to survive and sustain themselves here. There were extensive olive orchards and other fruit and cultivated gardens, fed by an ingenious system of canals using gravity to deliver water from a nearby river to the fields and households, and reservoirs that store water for irrigation. Definitely worth a visit. \\nSight-seeing companies in Loreto offered tours to SJ at US$69 per person.

The taxi had a company logo and phone number, and the driver was in uniform, with his name on the shirt. We felt pretty safe, but we took photos of both with our iPhone for our record, just in case. The driver spoke sufficiently good English, and knew the sights along the way as well as about San Javier, so we had a wonderful 4- hour tour for 1000 pesos (about $55).

As others have already said, the drive itself is worth it.  Beautiful views and rugged terrain.  Paved road can be dangerous so do NOT rubber neck too much.  Hazzards include major holes at the edge of the road that can swallow a small car and which are unmarked dangers.  No shoulders on the road in most places.  Open range cattle grazing so expect critters standing in or next to road.  No traffic to worry with so take your time and use the pull overs.  Enjoy the journey, but drive it in daylight only to be safe (road hazards).  Falling rocks are a real and continuous danger!  The mission is a nice one hour walk around but be sure to visit the area behind it with the old olive trees, cisterns, terraced fields and grounds.  Read the history of the mission (on-line sources) before going so you better appreciate the experience.   The mission is a shrine so show respect and keep children under control please.  Buy the &quot;coyota&quot; pastry on sale by the locals under trees beside the mission.  About 50 cents and you will love them!  The village that surrounds the mission has been spared much of what is not to like in lowland MX.  They live quietly without crime and do not overpower tourists with stalls filled with trinkets.  Good trip with friends, children or couples.

The mission is an hour\\u2019s drive from Loreto, through windy roads that keep climbing without ever reaching the top of the picturesque mountains in the south of Baja. The journey is breathtaking. You will marvel at its beauty. The 400-year-old mission is exquisite and stands proud. It is truly remarkable. It has been preserved in nearly pristine condition for four centuries, which, in my book, is something to celebrate. The mission contains a cemetery whose residents were laid to rest more than 100 years ago. Antique hand-forged one-of-a-kind crosses made by Mexican artisans adorn the gravesites. The mission is the showpiece within a tiny village of 72 people, all of whom had been off the grid for generations, before electricity began powering the village just ten years ago. Jorge manages the mission. He speaks passionately about the mission and is able to answer all questions about its history. I gave him a 100 peso tip and wish I had had more to give him. He is a knowledgeable docent and well worth tipping. Jorge speaks Spanish exclusively.   A five minute walk from the mission takes you to Sergio\\u2019s private olive tree farm, where there is an enormous 400 plus year-old olive tree. The tree is older than the 17th century mission. The 100 peso fee (about five dollars) Sergio extracts for seeing his farm is money well spent. It allows you to see a unique business operation and ancient tree while helping to support an entrepreneur in a very poor and remote village. Sergio speaks Spanish but knows a few spattering zwords of English. A vendor, whose name I unfortunately forget, sells fantastic home-made guava sugar cookies for a mere 30 pesos for a bag containing two huge cookies. I bought three bags. The villagers keep their place on Earth in immaculate condition. It is spotless. Bring pesos. You will be glad to have them, as they will allow you to support the endeavors of the people who are striving to eke out an honest living in a very poor and remote mountain region. By the way, it costs five pesos to use the only bathroom that is available. What I want to say most about Mision San Francisco Javier de Vigge Biaundo is Don\\u2019t Miss It!

Four of the group have been living in the Baja for 25 years, and this was to be their first visit, so I read.  I became so confused, I quit reading!  Every review had the opposite information so I will give you my report from January 2017.\\n\\nLeaving Hwy 1 near Loreto the road is fully paved.  Hardly a pothole to be found.  It is a beautiful drive - make sure your windows are clean!\\n\\nTake care as you wind through the mountains - they are doing road construction on a curve and installing drainage.  The detour was a little confusing even with a construction worker directing us, so drive slowly and take the time to know which road they want you to drive on.  \\n\\nWe encountered three places where we had to drive through water.  We got out and looked to make sure it was not too deep - it was only a few inches.  We were in a small suv and it was no problem.  \\n\\nOnce we arrived the church was open and staffed by a gentleman that only spoke Spanish.  That was no problem for us, but it could be if you don\\'t speak Spanish.  Both the Mission San Javier and Mission in Loreto claim to be the first in the chain of the California Missions.  It doesn\\'t really matter - both are worth seeing!\\n\\nThe Mission San Javier is a very drab looking church - not a put down - it\\'s just old and in its original condition.  It feels very &quot;real&quot; because it is.  You can feel the toil of the workers that cut and hauled the volcanic stone blocks from the surrounding hills.  Take some time to reflect while you are there.  Look out the church front doors to the orange tree lined boulevard and imagine you are in Sevilla, Spain, which has streets that look just like this one.  The seeds for the trees came from somewhere in Southern Spain and were brought by ship to the mission orchard.\\n\\nTo our disappointment we found out that the ancient Cave Paintings we came to hike to were covered up or wiped out by Hurricane Odile two years ago.  The next set of cave paintings is an hour away then an hour hike.  It was too close to dark to attempt that, so we settled on a short hike to see the amazingly twisted 300 year old olive tree behind the Mission and the irrigation system still being used after 300 years.\\n\\nWe did manage to exit the canyon at dusk.  I would not advise staying until dark.  Although encountering cows, a heard of goats, and fording streams is entertaining it isn\\'t advised to be out in an isolated area at night - even with 49 of your best friends.  Enjoy!

On our last day, we decided to take El Burro on a trip up into the mountains to see San Javier. Our innkeepers in Loreto said the road -- literally, &quot;The Road to San Javier&quot; -- was &quot;probably passable&quot; without a 4WD, but due to some recent rains, they told us to stop before any water crossing and send someone out ahead to wade through first to check the depth. Good advice! \\n\\nAt our first crossing, we saw a loaded tour van stop on the other side of the stream, and roughly 15 people got out to walk across. The unloaded van made it, so we felt confident that El Burro Rojo could make it, too. See photos. Yes, we are those people who should know better.\\n\\nThere were 3 water crossings one-way, and all were OK (well, the first one was a bit hairy). The twisty-turny mountain drive was actually very, very fun. Paved most of the way, and dirt sections were in good condition (no big ruts, potholes, etc.) Once we arrived at San Javier, the scene was simply mesmerizing -- a slice of 18th-century California preserved in time and space in a breathtaking mountain oasis setting. \\n\\nWe spent about an hour walking through the little town and exploring the mission &amp; grounds. 200 people reportedly call San Javier home, but when we were there in late December it felt deserted. There is a small residential neighborhood on the opposite side of town from the Mission, with an elementary school, etc. The vibe was other-wordly, eerie, and strangely beautiful. It\\'s challenging to imagine what life must have been like 200 years ago for the local folks and missionaries in this desolate, unforgiving, and glorious place.

There are also a couple of places to get something to eat and drink and sit outside next to the cobblestone street while you enjoy the view of the Mission.

We had a compact rental car with not the best tires, but the road to the mission is paved although one needs to exercise caution ensuring you have adequate fuel before the trip (no Pemex in historical San Javier) and watch out for stray rocks and boulders on the road.  It is a windy curvy road with some wash-outs but nothing our little compact car couldn\\'t handle, although you definitely want to depart from Loreto or Loreto Bay no later than 2 p.m. so you are returning before the sun sets between 6 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. as the road in the dark would prove to be risky, even for the adventurous!   The road to the Mision de San Fancisco Javier is a left just north of Nopolo and Loreto Bay, just past the Loreto airport or a right hand turn, just south of the town of Loreto before the airport.  There is some type of conservation sign that mentions San Javier but not a specific sign that indicates the mission name.  You will know you are on the correct road if you see a restaurant and grill on the right hand side of the road shortly after exiting off of highway one.  \\nThe scenery is beautiful as you wind through the Sierra Gigantica range and I think it took us less than an hour to arrive to the mission (39.9 kms), making a stop enroute for a photo opportunity half way there on the right hand side of the road is another small historic chapel (unnamed)  across from a little oasis called Rancho Las Parras.  You can apparently buy green olives at this ranch and there is a little cemetary beyond the small chapel but we didn\\'t find it.  \\nEnroute you will pass another ranch called Rancho Viejo where the mission was originally founded in 1699 and then moved to it\\'s current site by Jesuit Fransisco Maria Picollo in 1720.  We were amazed at the detail in the architecture or the mission and of course it\\'s location with the current day paved road and building amenities.  When we arrived we were greeted by the local perros (dogs) and a guide who asked for some information from us which he recorded in a visitors book.  We asked if we could take pictures inside which was permitted without the use of a flash.  The small town had a cobblestone road to the mission and looked very clean with some taquerias and apparently the original irrigation systems from centuries ago providing water to this day.  An orange tree right in front of the mission was in full bloom and the town also was graced with many olive trees.\\nWe returned on the same road we came up on as we didn\\'t know where the other road leading south west out of town would lead us and didn\\'t want to risk as to what condition that road would be in but apparently it does go back past a few rural ranchos and eventually leads back to the paved San Isadro highway.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Mision San Francisco Javier de Vigge-Biaundo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9f/93/9f/photo0jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Loreto", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "23893", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "259628474": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "First mission church to be built in the California\\'s", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150772-d3151161-Reviews-Mision_San_Francisco_Javier_de_Vigge_Biaundo-Loreto_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9f/93/9f/photo0jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This mission church is a must see.

We rented a car from Alamo, and drove up the canyon. The carved stonework is stunning! I just oggled at the view of the mission, its white domes set against the stark mountainside. Be sure and tip the guide who hangs out to greet visitors and tells them the stories. Our guy was about the zillionth generation resident of the community of @ 200 people who live around the mission. \\n\\nOn and around December 3 there is a huge celebration of the patron saint at the mission with hundreds--if not thousands--of people from all over congregating there.  Many people make the SEVEN HOUR walk from Loreto! \\n\\nThere is a visitor center with local crafts for sale a short walk away. Cold drinks are available at the corner store--since they got wired electricity [replacing the old generator] sometime in the early 2000s.\\n\\nAfter viewing the mission, walk down the path and see the 300 year old olive tree!  Continue past the tree--along the aqueduct--and visit Memo, who owns the land beyond the mission.  He\\'s featured in &quot;The Califonios&quot; by Leland Foerster.  He has over 1,000 trees on his land.  A real &quot;salt of the earth&quot; person. He looks like he just stepped out from the old mission days!\\n\\nIf you go in the spring--or after a rain--be sure and stop at one or more of the washes that cross the road on the way up the canyon--if they have water.  Birding and wildlife sighting is excellent! At the mission, see if you can spot the house wrens that have made a home behind an impossibly small crack in the stones which face the front of the mission--@ 20 feet up, left of center!

Our guide Roberto made the trip as enjoyable as possible while our driver Fausto skilfully navigated some rough roads washed out by last fall\\'s destructive Hurricane Paul. Our first stop was at a wide place in the road featuring a variety of local flora, streams and two ancient rock paintings. We were advised to touch nothing, for example, a nearby hierba de flecha shrub, every part of which is poisonous! We continued on to the outskirts of a ranch, once owned by three maiden sisters buried in a family cemetery near a chapel open to the pilgrims who trek to San Javier. The mission itself, built by the Jesuits, and the surrounding village is quite lovely. How and why such a place was constructed is difficult for a person living in the 21st Century to fathom. The mission is still active in that on Thursdays, a priest travels to the village to conduct mass for local inhabitants. Roberto took us on a walking tour to show us the locally grown crops (onions, citrus, beans,  olives) and so we could see the oldest olive tree in the America\\'s. It\\'s a 300 year old monster, missing one major branch where some payoso backed a pickup into the tree. Later, we had lunch at what appears to be the only restaurant in town; we enjoyed the food. My husband sampled the locally made wine; it\\'s a sweet uncorked red made from a cabernet grape. To the amusement of our fellow travelers he pronounced it &quot;not complex&quot; but bought a bottle anyway for 200 pesos. On the way out of the village, Roberto stopped at a small hotel, &quot;Casa de Ana&quot;, at our request to pick up info-- we think it would be fun to return to the area on our own with friends for an overnight stay. Their handout describes the property as having &quot;rustic style adobe bungalows&quot; at 450 pesos per room.
