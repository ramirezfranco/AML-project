Campeche\\'s well preserved buildings and fortifications are a typical example of a new world Spanish colonial harbour town. The almost 1000 historically significant buildings are found in a 1.8 sq. km. area, of which 0.5 sq. km. are enclosed within a system of walls and fortifications. There are excellent tourist maps detailing these &quot;sites of interest&quot;. \\nThe fortifications, three batteries and two forts, are located outside the walled section.We only managed to get to Fuerte de San Miguel. This fort is about 4.2 km from the Gamma Campeche Malec\\u00f3n, where we were staying. The fort, built in the late eighteenth century, was meant to protect the town against an anticipated attack by the British. It is fully restored and now houses a museum of Mayan art. There was a small entrance fee of 55 pesos. Fuerte de San Jose el Alto, located on the opposite end of town, also has a museum which features a collection of boats and weapons from the period.\\nThere are eight baluartes (bulwarks), defensive bastions, on the corners, all now serving different functions. We didn\\'t go to all of them, but we can recommend the ones that we did. Baluarte of Santiago now serves as the jardin botanico Xmuch\\' haltun, a nice quiet refuge that highlights about 200 plant species endemic to the region, entrance is 10 pesos each. The Baluarte of San Carlos holds the city museum, and the connection that Campeche has with its &quot;pirate past&quot;! The other bulwark that we made it to, is the largest, Baluarte de la Soledad. It houses the Museo de Arquitectura Maya and features &quot;the Mask of Calakmul. a very beautiful funerary mask composed of jade, shell and grey obsidian, a must see! This is a very nice museum, not large but definitely a worthwhile visit. The signage is also in english. One thing that I had not seen before, was a strip set into the floor, this was meant to be a guide for the visually impaired. A person could use their cane and be guided by this strip to a copy of one of artifacts being displayed and then by touching with their hands get an idea of what it looked like. There was also a &quot;sign&quot; in Braille that explained about the object. Interestingly, we had seen this in other places in town, a good explanation for a very good purpose!\\nThe whole town really is a museum, just outside the Baluarte de la Soledad, is the El Palacio Centro Cultural. This museum shows you some of the past history as it relates to commerce and the connection it has had with attacks from pirates, etc. It is right across from the plaza, and on the weekends, it features a magnificent light show. The openings are shuttered and different moving images are projected on the exterior, showing Campeche\\'s link to the past. It is very well choreographed, the production was designed to fit into the building\\'s architecture, even matching the inclusion of the arches. It is very well done and apparently is one of several light shows shown in the old town. There is also one held at Puerta de Tierra. The Plaza de La Independencia is the centre of much of what happens in the Centro Historico. Indeed, there seems to be something happening here all the time, celebrations, cultural events, etc. On the east side, you will find the Catedral de Campeche, dating from the 16th century. In a courtyard, off to one side, you will find a small museum housing old relics. There is a small entrance fee. Across the plaza, Casa No. 6, a restored colonial casa, showing what life was like for an upper- class Campechano family during prerevolutionary times. You can catch the Transporte Touristico bus here as well. One of their tours takes you to the different barrios surrounding the city walls, and around to several of the old churches associated with them. The Santuario de Guadalupe, a beautiful, yellow church dating from the 1600\\'s is in the 500 year old barrio of the same name. In the barrio of San Francisco is the Iglesia de San Francisco, a church which dates from the mid-1500\\'s. This is where the first Catholic liturgy was offered at the arrival of the Spaniards in 1517. In the barrio of San Roman, the tourist train stops at the Iglesia de San Roman, the home of the Cristo Negro. If you are interested in &quot;history&quot; and &quot;historic&quot; churches, these are just a few of  Campeche\\'s churches. This is a city where history, is depicted and lived in both its old buildings and structures and its plentiful museums!\\nThe past is something that we &quot;live\\' for, yes, but fortunately, there is much of the present and the future to live for as well. This is no more evident in the activity and events that take place all around the town. As was said, there was always something happening in the square, music, different events, families enjoying the evening. We were staying at the Gamma hotel. From the Gamma Hotel, where we were staying, to the Sea Gate, there was a small mall. Most nights, particularly on weekends. there would be lively music events going on and crowds of people listening and dancing along. You kind of got the idea that this type thing went on all through the year. Why not? The evenings are aways so lovely! We were here in early December, so they were setting up decorations all around town, in particular in the square just outside the Sea Gate. There were several events that took place here, a Pan y Pasteles fair one day. There were booths set up where they were selling breads, sweets, pizzas, etc. A great place to enjoy authentic food, there or take-out. The last night we were in Campeche, there was a big Christmas celebration held here, with lots of families taking part in the festivities. There was much going on, and later on, featured a great firework display. Meanwhile, we were attending a concert in the square, complete with a band, a very talented singer and backup singers. All professional and again, great audience participation, dancing and singing along! Lots happening, people just celebrating life. \\nCampeche is not on the &quot;tourist radar\\', yet, maybe this a good thing, there are &quot;tourists&quot;, albeit not many. It is an authentic Mexican town. It is mostly a town for Campechanos, who enjoy living in Campeche, and are justly proud of their city. To quote Lonely Planet\\', Campeche is a historical fairy tale&quot;.\\nPS, One final blurb. There are many fine eaterys to be found here, and of course, Calle 59 is a good place to start. Here there are many fine restaurants, all offering good food, at good prices. We did not always eat out, but would recommend the following: Patronis Bar, Bavit and our favourite, Ambigu 59. Our favourite coffee place was Cafe Frappisimo, and for treats, a nice little bakery called, &quot;La Nueva Espano&quot;. Last but not least, La Michoacana for ice cream. These are all good places, all offering good/variety food at reasonable prices.

On weekends at 8 pm there is a fantastic light show projected on the facade from the park in the square. This show is much more sophisticated and poetic than any light shows you may see in Merida or at archaeological sites. It is absolutely delightful! On the Friday evening we attended, a very good marimba concert preceded the light show.

Yet we\\'ve seen over 40 pre-Columbian sites in Mexico and Calakmul was the only major disappointment. It has two large pyramids worthy of its status of a powerful ancient city-state, both among the largest in the Yucatan, but other unique features of Calakmul are off limits to visitors. There are a lots of badly deteriorated stelae at the site but that\\'s about it. The murals, friezes, and burial chambers are closed. A guide told me they are concerned that visitors\\' breath may create dangerous levels of humidity but that seems to be a poor excuse. The murals of Bonampak, Teotihuacan, and Cacaxtla among others are exposed to outside humidity year round. The friezes of Balamku and Becan can be accessed inside the galleries upon request, and the famous masks of Kohunlich and sculptures of Ek Balam are protected from the elements only by thatched canopies. The burial chamber of Pakal the Great in Palenque is open to the public too. So I doubt it\\'s humidity, it\\'s rather bad management hence the one-star. \\n\\nThe road to Calakmul consists of 60 km of a poorly paved road going from Rt 186 all the way to the ruins. It\\'s quite narrow in spots. It takes about an hour to drive if there\\'s no slow vehicle in front of you, and though you can speed 65-75 km there, be careful not to hit wild animals. There are three payments to be made along the way: at the entry point near Rt 186, at the turn at the site museum, and the regular admission fee of 70 pesos at the site entrance. I don\\'t remember how much it was in total but I think it was around US $10 pp.\\n\\nIf I knew that the murals and frieze cannot be seen I would have skipped it altogether. Considering the time and effort, climbing just the two pyramids is not worth it. We stayed in Xpujil and it took us a little over 2 hours to drive each way and a little over an hour at the site.

Here the details:\\n\\nThe way there: although there are &quot;only&quot; 60km from the road 186 to Calakmul you can only drive about 40-50km/hr as there are wild animals crossing the road, the road is narrow for 2 cars and lots of curves. If you find a car coming from the other direction it can get &quot;tight&quot;.  The road is through the jungle and we got to see some wild. Great experience to cross through the dense trees. \\n\\nEntrance fees: we paid 3 times. The first payment is for the first 20km as this road is part of an Ejido. The 2nd payment is for the remaining 40km, also an institution that charges for crossing through the land. Finally you get to Calakmul and pay the Entrance Fee charged by the INAH (Instituto Nacional de Arqueolog\\u00eda e Historia). All together about 170 pesos. \\n\\nThe ruins: contrary to Palenque in Calakmul there is NOT a single merchant in the entrance. Nobody selling heats, mosquito repellent, food, sandals, or even water. Its just you, the jungle and the 3 guys taking care of the entrance. The place is huge and you will need to walk a lot, there are many different groups of ruins which you pss by while walking and if you pay attention you will see many more ruins still camouflage by the think jungle. This makes it magic, you know you are walking in a place which hides many secrets. We visited many structures, you are allowed to clim all of them and finally we arrived ad this estructura 6 I think. Looks like a tall pyramid but is so steep you cannot see the peak. We climbed carefully, little leg shaking included, just to arrive at &quot;the top&quot;, turn around and realize you are above the jungle! From up there we couldn\\'t even see the other many buildings which we had climbed before because they were all hidden in the jungle. It was this feeling like when you clim such a tall mountain that you are above the clouds. Happy of achieving the &quot;peak&quot; I walked around a bit to realize it wasn\\'t over there were another maybe 20 mts up to climb.. and we were above the trees, with only green in the horizon.\\n\\nIn Summary: wonderful impressions fem the top of the pyramids. You can still climb the tallest structures contrary to Chichen-Itza or Palenque and there are no merchants trying to sell you anything.\\n\\nMy recommendation: make the time to stop here while traveling from Chetumal to Palenque or Campeche.

It is not a site where everything is in front of you. It is not a site where you walk in, look, and walk out. it is not a site where you are bombarded by salesmen at every few meters trying to sell you the same stuff. This is a site where you forget bout time and place. You need about one hour and a quarter to get to the site and you will be there 2-3 hours. You will walk about 6-7 kms and climb structures tat are about 17 stories high. You will feel away from everything you know. And when you are at the top of the structures, you will feel on top of the world, looking down. You will not see one cable, one house... You will see all the way into Guatemala about 35 KMS away. You should even be able to see the top of El Mirador site in Guatemala. Of course, one must not forget the animals. howler and spider monkeys, ocelated turkeys, coati mundi, deer, parakeets, toucans, agoutis, pecaris... This is a major migratory place for birds. \\n\\nThe site is huge, but you only get to see 5-6% of the whole site. If you go after April, be ready to be hot. Average is around 40C degrees. Mosquitoes will arrive when the rain starts, usually May/June. In the Mayan world, there are a lot of sites that need to be seen. This one tops them all. This place is great for all ages.

We did come in \\'off\\' season (November 16), but even restaurants complete with signage seemed complete deserted or even abandoned. \\n\\nWe made it about 15 kms from Cuidad Del Carmen before we gave up and turned around. We read that one would have to pay a local fisherman or seek a boat to tour for dolphin sightings, but quoted just under 900 pesos just didn\\'t seem worth the trouble, although I would consider seeing dolphins in the wild a once in a lifetime opportunity. We decided we would be better off to do an actual dolphin tour in Cancun than go any further on this \\'Island\\'. \\n\\nThe positives of the day trip was a scenic drive along the water. Perhaps we might\\'ve had better success had we reached Cuidad Del Carmen but the feeling of being the only tourists in the area was surprisingly not the greatest feeling. We were also warned by a Campeche local that crime is high in the area, as it is an area known for oil patches and a lot of workers have been apparently out of jobs. \\n\\nIf you want to feel like you are the only person on an abandoned not-so-island, then look no further.

This makes for some fascinating reading, though as a native Spanish speaker I\\'m warning you that if you don\\'t read Spanish, you may just want to skip the museum altogether.  The exhibit has English translations, but they\\'re not very good.  \\n\\nWhether you visit the museum or not, from the base of the bastion you can walk up to the top of the wall that connects the San Francisco, San Juan, and Santa Rosa bastions.

The wall has two doors: sea and land door. A small museum is next to the land door and there you come to know that the city suffered ten or eleven attacks of pirates. Of course, Drake and Morgan were present in that list. The museum also tells you that a group of pirates captured two Franciscan priests near the city . They asked ransom for them, but no one paid, so the pirate ship sailed into the sea with its prisoners. It happend that a storm sank the ship and the only two survivors were the priests. But while you decide what is the real history of the place, you can walk by its old streets and take a look at the cathedral. You can also take a look to the color by which the old houses are painted and by closing your eyes for a minute think you can also see you youself in that place under the heat of the sun in  the late XVIII century talking to Mr.and Mrs. Perez (Smith) before opening the wooden door of your house.  You can also go to visit the two forts that are both side of the city: Fuerte San Miguel and Fuerte San Jos\\u00e9, which were built in the late part of the XVIII. There you can see their old and useless cannons that threatened pirates and other enemies of the time. But if you want something real of this world that is marvellous then go to have lunch at Marganzo. Oh, my God, there I asked for the fish of the day with a special sauce of \\u201cflor de calabaza\\u201d (sauce of pumpkin flower?) with a glass of w\\u00e1ter of chia combined with pineapple. Uf, that is something wonderful to eat and drink. Or if you like more modern and more traditional place to eat sea food then you can go to Pirigua and ask for their fish with green (parsley) sauce. Here and there you can order shrimps, octupus and baby shark. I enjoyed very much the place because I was not only in an old well preserved city, but I was also in place where you can take a tour to visit important Mayan archeological sites that are somewhat close such as: Edzn\\u00e1, Hochob, Dzibilnocac, El Tabasque\\u00f1o and other places.

The walls were built to protect Campeche from continuous pirate raids by the likes of the infamous Henry Morgan and Campeche\\'s arch nemesis Laurens de Graaf. \\n\\nI paid $15 mxn to go up onto the walls just down from the Puerta de la Tierra. You can walk along them and get a feel for the history while also taking in some great views of the city. At the bottom there are a few small museum rooms which are also quite interesting. There are other parts of the wall  which are accessible and have museums throughout the city.\\n\\nFrom Thursday to Sunday at 8:00pm there\\'s a show on at the Puerta de la Tierra which costs $60 mxn. It\\'s a bit weird to be honest. The guides dress up in old  costumes and take you through the gate and up on to the wall, explaining the different features. It\\'s interesting enough but a wee bit dull. They then take you back down and sit you to the left of the gate and play a video while the guides act out parts of it. In the first place it\\'s difficult to pay attention to both the video and the actors at the same time. Secondly, the video is ludicrous! It gives a really simplistic history of how there were Mayans here and then the Spanish came and invaded them.

The entire historic centre of Campeche is surrounded by a tall, lovely and well-preserved wall and it was originally used to protect the city against pirate attacks. \\n\\nI visited the wall on the afternoon of November 26th as a solo traveler. \\n\\nThe wall is linked by various entrances known as baluartes. You can climb up stairs to the top of the wall and then stroll along certain sections. \\n\\nI climbed the steep ramp at the Baluarte San Francisco (Calle 57 at Calle 18) on the south side of the city, which led to a large open area on top of the wall with cannons and a bell. From there, I walked along a portion of the narrow stone walkway on top of the wall (only certain sections of the wall are open for walking and I had to turn around to go back down the way I came) up until the Baluarte de San Juan. The views of the colourful buildings in the historic centre and the tall cathedral, were absolutely stunning. \\n\\nThe stone wall around the city is tall and huge and I enjoyed walking alongside it at the ground level as well. \\n\\nIt was interesting to see the Puerto de la Tierra (on the south side of the wall), which is an opening in the wall serving as the land gate into the centre of the city. There was a huge cannon inside the walkway through the gate. \\n\\nSome of the Baluartes had small museums or gardens inside them that you could visit for a small entrance fee (Baluarte San Francisco has a small pirate museum; Baluarte de San Carlos houses the small Museo de la Ciudad about Campeche\\u2019s history; Baluarte de San Pedro houses the Museo y Galeria de Arte Popular which highlights Campeche\\u2019s indigenous handicrafts and has exhibits of regional folk art; Baluarte de Santiago has the Jardin Botanico Xmuch\\u2019haltun which is a botanical garden with native plant species; and the Baluarte de Nuestra Senora de la Soledad houses the Museo de la Arquitectura Maya). \\n\\nI visited the Museo de la Arquitectura inside the Baluarte de Nuestra Senora de la Soledad, located at Calle 8 and 57, on the north side of the wall. The entrance fee was 39 pesos. The museum contained exhibits with collections of artifacts from Mayan ruins in the Chenes, Rio Bec and Puuc regions. The displays were in both English and Spanish. The museum was very interesting and I enjoyed reading about the history of these ancient ruins, the various architectural styles, the meaning of various Mayan symbols and their writing system, and how the Mayans lived. \\n\\nAfter visiting the museum, I climbed the ramp to the top of the Baluarte de Nuestra Senora de la Soledad. Similar to the Baluarte San Francisco, there was a large open area which then narrowed into a walkway along the wall in both directions. From here, I was rewarded with a different but just as beautiful view of the Gulf of Mexico on one side of the wall and the cathedral, central plaza and historic centre on the other side. \\n\\nThe Puerta del Mar was the opening in the wall known as the \\u201csea gate,\\u201d located at the corner of Calles 8 and 59. From this opening, there was a well-maintained paved path that lead to the Malecon walkway along the Gulf of Mexico coastline, which was absolutely beautiful. \\n\\nDuring the entire time I was exploring these Baluartes and strolling on top of the walls, I was completely alone with no other people around. It was such a relaxing time in a quiet atmosphere. I definitely felt like the old city wall and the baluartes were a hidden gem in Campeche! \\n\\nWalking along the top of the wall while admiring the gorgeous views of the surrounding city as well as exploring a few of the baluartes was a very enjoyable experience for me!

We we here because my nephew was getting married at the Hacienda Uayamon (beautiful place). We spent several days just walking around within the walled city. You do not need a car unless you venture out. They have done an amazing job restoring the city and wall. Hacienda Puerta Campeche is another super nice hotel, we had a very nice dinner there. We ate at Hotel Casa Don Gustavo once for breakfast and once for dinner and it was great and the service was great to. All of the Baluartes are worth a visit and you can walk on the wall in a couple of sections which offers a nice perspective on the area. In the evenings Calle 59 comes alive with table all out in the street (now a pedestrian/art area).Chocol Ha is a must visit, try the hot chocolate with chilies it is really good. Best on a cold night. Try Gambuca Cafe on Calle 57 between 12th &amp; 14th, it is right across from Hotel Socaire. We had a great breakfast there several mornings. There are some nice shops within the walled city. Everything was very clean, lots of &quot;tourist police&quot;, security cameras, we felt very safe within the walled city. Everyone was very friendly. The front desk staff at Hotel Socaire all spoke very good English it was kind of hit and miss everywhere else, but we were fine with our broken Spanish. It was fun to visit the open market just outside the west wall, very colorful with piles of Habanero chili peppers, fruits, vegetables and meats. \\n\\nWe rented a car through Easy Way, they no longer have a Campeche office, but a driver brought the car down from Merida for us and it worked out great. Driving tips, make sure you know where you are getting gas. There is not much available off the main highway. We drove though several police check points and did not have any problems. If we were stopped they just asked where we were going and waved us on. Do carry your passports, my son who was traveling with cousins was stopped and they wanted to see everyone\\'s passports. My nephew had a couple of run ins with the police in Cancun. Avoid driving the secondary roads at night, too many bikes, scooters, tuk tuk type vehicles with little to no lights. The highway was pretty good unless it is pouring down rain and then it is a little hairy, as drainage is not always the best. My cell phone service is TMobile and it worked great, even though it was on roaming. My GPS/google maps worked far better than I expected and we were driving in some remote areas. Even when I lost the tracking I still had the map and could follow along and then I would get enough service and it would catch up.\\n\\nWe visited Baluarte de San Jose El Alto just to the north of the walled city. They are still working on the exhibits, but it is worth a visit to see the lay of the land.\\n\\nVisited Edzna, the closest Mayan ruins to Campeche well worth the drive. Only a couple other tourist there, not a lot of information there so study up before you go.\\nVisited Uxmal farther north, much bigger and better preserved than Edzna, missed the Chocolate museum close to the ruin so we could get to some cenotes. Visited one in the little town of Peba. No lighting, but nice swimming hole, I think they charged 10 pesos. Not much of anything else there. Then we stopped at Cenote San Ignacio in Chochola and that was nice, with lighting, clean bathrooms to change. It is pretty well signed from the highway. The cenote is very deep. We ate that night back in Campeche just north of the old city is a string of thatched roofed restaurants on the water. I can not remember the name maybe Eges Kalkini our waiter was Bismark and he was super nice. He didn\\'t speak much English, but gave great service and the food was great too.\\n\\nDay trip to Celestun, boat ride out to see the Flamingos.  It was a lot of fun even if it was not the season, we still saw a lot of Flamingos for us. We also saw an alligator and lots of other birds. Have dinner out on the beach after the boat trip. We ate at Pampanos and it was very good. That was also the nicest beach we saw.\\n\\nAlso took a drive to the south, made it as far as Sabancuy. Didn\\'t see anything too exciting, just explored.\\n\\nOverall a great trip!

The site was inhabited as early as 600 BC and abandoned in the 16th century. It was discovered in 1907 and excavation was started in 1958. In 1986, Guatemalan refugees were hired by coordinating agencies to help with the excavation, restoration and maintenance of the site, this was sponsored and funded by various international agencies. The most remarkable features of the site include the main temple and the ball court, located in the plaza. There is a display, under cover, which features different images modelled in stucco. They are well preserved and still retain their original colours of red, blue-green and black.\\nEdzna is approximately one hours distance from Campeche. To get there you can book a tour, Kankabi OK Tours located on Calle 59 seems a good choice. Here you can get the full meal deal, or just take transportation, the quoted cost was 479 pesos pp. We hired, Luis, the taxi driver who had delivered us to our hotel, Gamma Campeche Malec\\u00f3n. Luis\\'s services, on his business card, is listed as &quot;Nueva Generacion&quot;, offers tours, both in the city and to outside locations as well. Luis is a very friendly, personable man, interested in communicating to his guests in spanish, and also very eager to improve on his english. For only 900 pesos, you can enjoy your own personal guide, and if you wish, can also arrange to visit additional venues. You can reach Luis at 981.169.3173.\\nThere was road construction happening on the way out to Edzna, otherwise, it is a pretty straight forward journey there. There is a bit of an interpretive centre where you buy your entrance fee, which only cost us 60 pesos each. The washrooms, modern, are in a separate building and there is only a vending machine where you can purchase drinks and snacks. So if you desire something more substantial, bring your own or be prepared to go to a nearby town. The grounds are well kept and the walking is flat and easy. The sights are well marked and include interpretive signs that include english. There is pretty much free access to the ruins, so if you desire you can climb up for a &quot;better view&quot;. The main temple is an exception, and there are others where you will not be able to, because of bad conditions. When we visited, there were not many people, I believe that this is usually the case, unfortunately, this cannot be said for the mosquitoes. I have seen and been in worse, but they still are bad, so don\\'t forget to bring your mosquitoe repellent! The evacuated site is not huge, I would think that two hours to explore should be enough.\\nThe Yucatan has a great many Mayan sites and Edzna is certainly one worth visiting.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arquelogica Edzna", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/bf/90/b2/zona-arquelogica-edzna.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Valle de Edzna, Carretera 180 entronque con la 188 Se localiza a 55 km de la ciudad de Campeche", "addressLocality": "Campeche", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "638798724": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Excellent day touring Edzna", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g1632078-d8807078-Reviews-Zona_Arquelogica_Edzna-Campeche_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/bf/90/b2/zona-arquelogica-edzna.jpg", "datePublished": "December 11, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Wow, we really enjoyed our day here.

Catch the bus on the east side of the main Campeche market (Mercado Pedro Sainz de Baranda). Its off the second street east.  The first street Calle Costa Rica has the market upper floor parking lot ramp.  The next one is Calle Nicaragua.  Follow Nicaragua a short distance to Calle Chichuahua.  The colectivios will be on the corner.  The service starts at 7 AM and runs every hour.  To ensure a seat on the next bus, be there 45 minutes ahead or you will be left behind or potentially have a really uncomfortable seat.  The buses are air-conditioned but don\\u2019t count on keeping cool.  Seats to the front are cooler.  The trip took 1 hour.  We missed the 9 AM bus as we wandered the mercado too long so we were first on the 10 AM.  The road off the freeway to Edzna is being widened and re-paved.  Its a very bumpy ride.  The bus will drop you off, and pick you up right at the park entrance.  You pay the $40 Pesos fee when you exit at either end of the ride.\\nThe Park:\\nThe park entrance fee is $60 Pesos.  They have no site maps.  There is plenty of signage around, with English for background.  There are two areas available for viewing.  The Grand Plaza is the one to go to.  Its nearest to the park reception and where you will spend most of your visit.  The other area, the Sorcerious, about a 10 minute walk further, has little of the site overburden removed so not much to see.\\nThe Grand Plaza is worth the visit.  There were maybe 6 others visiting at the same time (Saturday), so crowds are not here.  You can climb around all the site except for the Grand Acropolis - Cinco Pesos.   We were actively on site for 1.5 hours and felt that was sufficient.  There are no services at the park except for washrooms.\\nThe colectivo arrived to pick us up just before 1 PM.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arquelogica Edzna", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/bf/90/b2/zona-arquelogica-edzna.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Valle de Edzna, Carretera 180 entronque con la 188 Se localiza a 55 km de la ciudad de Campeche", "addressLocality": "Campeche", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "626755582": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A spacious opening for light!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g1632078-d8807078-Reviews-Zona_Arquelogica_Edzna-Campeche_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/bf/90/b2/zona-arquelogica-edzna.jpg", "datePublished": "October 20, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This beautiful piece of history is wonderful to explore.

They were all unique, beautiful, impressive and very well-preserved and restored. \\n\\nAfter entering the ruins, we walked along a lovely, peaceful and pleasant path through the jungle which soon opened up to a large grassy courtyard called the Gran Plaza. There were some interesting ruins in this area (the Central Ceremonial Group and Platform of the Knives). I enjoyed climbing to the top of the Nohoch-Na, which was a very long platform consisting of stone steps. The views of the entire ruins site from the top of the Nohoch-Na were amazing! \\n\\nDirectly across from the Gran Plaza was the Gran Acropolis, which was a large platform with a grassy courtyard surrounded by structures on all sides. It was accessed via a set of wide stairs. \\n\\nThe Temple of Five Stories was the focal point and the most impressive structure at Edzna. This five-tiered temple was massive and the architecture was beautiful! It was amazing to think that people actually built such a large structure years ago and that it is still standing today. While the front of the temple was incredibly restored, the back of the temple remained completely covered and engulfed in the thick jungle. Unfortunately, it was prohibited to climb the temple. On one side of this temple, stood the much smaller Northwest Temple and on the other side was the House of the Moon temple. Both of these structures could be climbed via the steep stairs. I climbed both and enjoyed admiring the views of the other ruins from the top. \\n\\nI visited the Ball Court next, which was situated close to the Gran Acropolis. From there, I explored the Small Acropolis, just south of the Gran Acropolis and the Ball Court. There were a few interesting structures in the Small Acropolis called the Temple of the Relief Stairways, Structure 419-2, and the Temple of the Masks. \\n\\nWe were able to climb and touch almost all of the ruins, except for the massive five-tiered palace. \\n\\nThere were no crowds during our visit to these ruins and after a small children\\u2019s school group left, we were completely alone and had the entire site to ourselves, which was wonderful. The atmosphere was so calm, peaceful, and serene which made for a relaxing environment to leisurely wander and explore these ruins. We spent about two hours at the ruins. \\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed my experience visiting the Edzna ruins. Although they are lesser known and further off the beaten path than many other ruins in the Yucatan, they are definitely very deserving of a visit.

Some say that it is a combination of all of the styles used by this culture over a 3000 year period, crowned with something a little different.

The entire length of the building is a staircase which leads up to the remains of rooms where the government of the city was probably conducted.  Across the plaza from the Big House is a huge raised platform on which numerous temples were built.  The most impressive is the so-called &quot;Five Story Building&quot; which was a combination palace and pyramid.  It\\'s style is rather distinctive from other Mayan pyramids.  At each level there are many rooms and on the temple at the top there are the remains of a roof comb.  You can\\'t go into the rooms, but you can climb the central staircase to the top.  The view is very impressive.\\n\\nIf you venture a little way from the plaza you will find the remains of a structure covered with a thatched roof with some well preserved masks of the Sun God.\\n\\nEdzna may not be as big as Chichen Itza, or boast the incredible stone mosaics of Uxmal, but it definitely deserves a couple hours of your time if you are in the area.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arquelogica Edzna", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/bf/90/b2/zona-arquelogica-edzna.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Valle de Edzna, Carretera 180 entronque con la 188 Se localiza a 55 km de la ciudad de Campeche", "addressLocality": "Campeche", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Museo_Arqueologico_de_Campeche_Fuerte_de_San_Miguel-Campeche_Yucatan_Peninsula": {"675915402": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Not huge, but well done", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g1632078-d7200409-Reviews-Museo_Arqueologico_de_Campeche_Fuerte_de_San_Miguel-Campeche_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/01/2e/9c/forte-san-jose.jpg", "datePublished": "May 23, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This was much better than I expected.

There were a few areas along the path where there were circular jut-outs from the path stretched out over the water. They all differed and some had monuments, artistic pieces and even ancient cannons.
