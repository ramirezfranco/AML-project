The strong point of this project is the number and variety of restaurants located on the top level.  All of them offer outdoor terrace dining, and since the project faces south, you can enjoy a magnificent view of the Sierra Madre.  Some of the best restaurants in San Pedro are to be found here.  \\n\\nThe less strong aspects are due to the fact that this project is now ten years old and is no longer state-of-the art.  The middle level and the lower level are a hodge podge of various boutiques, services. automotive showrooms, a Starbuck\\'s Coffee and other uses.  There is a surface parking lot and two levels of underground parking (all pay).  The escalators are in the northeastern corner and there are also elevators, but the lateral and vertical circulation leaves something to be desired and the signage in the parking garage could be better.  There is an entrance from Calzada del Valle in the front, but the exits are to the west, to Av. Rio de la Plata, or to the north, in back of the project, to Av. Rio Manzanares.  You need to be traveling west on the Calzada del Valle in order to access this project, it can only be accessed from this direction.  401 is generally quite crowded in the evening and really crowded on Friday and Sat. evenings, so consider making reservations.
