Included in our Taxco tour was a natural mine where we got a tour inside. There is an interesting story on how they discovered a mine in this location. There use to be a dancing club above ground. The drunk patrons use to bang their head on the low ceiling when passing through a hall. The owners of the establishment decided they were going to dig up the floor to make more room so the patrons could walk through more easily and that is when they discovered a mine below.  They give you a hair net and a hard hat to wear before you go in the elevator shaft to go down in the mine. If you want to take photos there is a group charge. There was another larger Spanish tour group that took the same tour. The tour guide from the mine only spoke Spanish, After the tour, upstairs we all had a Minero cocktail included.

The silver shops are great. Some are high end that have worked on reproduction of famous jewelry pieces such as those worn by Frida Khalo...and have won prizes.. Another option is getting a guide to take you to an underground silver market that had similar pieces for half the price and you can even negotiate... They especially start the important reductions when you try the \\' walk away\\'.    There are also shops to get local embroidered clothes and limits shops with serving dishes.   There are plenty of restaurants in the town center.  I recommend getting a guide at the cathedral.  You can also take funicular to some spectacular hotel restaurants with amazing mountain views!    Overall, this place is worth the day trip.  If you are into holy. Celebrations of Holy Week before Easter...they do the stations of the cross with quite vivid personalities enacting even the sacrificial men who would hit and hurt themselves  on purpose.

One is the &quot;Telerferico&quot; (the cable car) however you will have to pay. It\\'s located by &quot;Los Arcos&quot; and you can take a taxi or a combi (collective taxi van) that indicates &quot;Arcos&quot; and you walk up to the entrance from there. It\\'s 90 MXN$ to ride. It takes you pretty high to the top of the hotel &quot;MonteTaxco&quot;, there\\'s not really much to do there unless you want to grab a michelada or go to the hotel\\'s overpriced bar. The view is a great panoramic view although it\\'s a short (about 5 minutes) ride up. I recommend going for the sunset to really enjoy it. The other is by climbing to the highest point in Taxco where there is the statue of the Christ. This is a bit a challenge if you\\'re not in good condition. It can be a steep long walk. You can ask one of the taxi\\'s to take you up and down if you\\'re not up for it. It\\'s worth it because it\\'s a beautiful view for the sunrise and a great spot to take some pictures.

We had an hour and half to explore on our own the area of the Zocalo. What a lovely place to enjoy. The Zocalo is surrounded by many shops, Santa Prisca Church and the very interesting winding narrow roads going up to the hills filled with vendors selling their wares, food and souvenirs. It is even fun to watch all the vehicules trying to manoevre down those narrow winding roads leading to main circle around the Zocalo. In the Zocalo there is alot of things going on. Now the Zocalo is not very big-no where near the size of Mexico City or Acapulco. But it is very pretty and quaint. A lot of people just sitting around on the benches, with some vendors walking around selling souvenirs or selling snacks like churros. There was even going on while we were there a few shows in the square-a folkloric dance group and a fashion show of some comic book characters", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zocalo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0d/67/dd/plaza-borda-taxco-catedral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Taxco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "594431603": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Gird yourself to endure constant sales pitches", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150803-d256090-Reviews-Zocalo-Taxco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0d/67/dd/plaza-borda-taxco-catedral.jpg", "datePublished": "July 9, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Zocalo is no place to relax. That\\u2019s fine. It\\u2019s a hub of energy and its spokes reach up the ascending cobblestone walkways that encircle the central kiosk. If it\\u2019s a tradition to sell wares in the Zocalo then simply accept it. At every turn there\\u2019s a new vendor selling trinkets and souvenirs. Unless you duck into a storefront or restaurant there\\u2019s no relief from the encounters. The same goes for the solicitations to enter the silver shops. I couldn\\u2019t figure it out but there were also quasi-tour guides who intercepted us inside the church and guided us, and followed us, to certain landmarks. Were we supposed to tip them regardless of taking their advice? I don\\u2019t know. I was with two friends and sometimes found myself uncharacteristically shielding myself behind them. As I said, take it for what it\\u2019s worth. Do research before shopping for silver there to know which are both legitimate retailers and fair negotiators. I couldn\\u2019t tell. My friends wanted me to purchase something after they filled their bags with wares so they talked me into buying an embroidered peasant blouse from a shop off the main streets. We were told with great confidence that it was \\u2018hecho en Mexico.\\u2019 Our laughter must still be echoing in the valleys as we drove away from Taxco and I read the label \\u2018Made in India.\\u2019 Snookered. My friend, a Mexican native, explained that the Indian factories bought up the patterns and designs of Mexican clothing, make them by factory machine in India, and they export them to Mexico. It\\u2019s a shame. It wasn\\u2019t much money and I helped the local economy, I guess, but I didn\\u2019t feel satisfied that I traveled that deep into Mexico only to buy an Indian-made blouse and avoid buying silver because I felt like I was being shaken down. It\\u2019s a lovely Spanish colonial village so perhaps that should be the point of your trip, not shopping.

Do take pesos with you tho, it\\'s difficult to change US to pesos anywhere except the bank, and the lines are usually pretty long. But, do check out the churches -- they are breathtaking. The food is great everywhere (even street food) but, DON\\'T DRINK THE WATER OR DRINK BEVERAGES WITH ICE IN THEM! If you go get sick though, any pharmacy can get you supplied with meds that will help. The vendors in the Zocolo do expect serious barganing, so be prepared.

It\\'s laid in beautiful mountains which gives amazing views wherever you are in the city. The streets are extremely steep and beautiful with black shiny cobblestone and white decorations. The houses are all painted in the same colors: dark red and white with red tile roofs. It is such a pleasure just walking the streets but make sure you get of the touristiest areas as well. We were there during the Dia de Muertos and it was amazing. There were beautiful flower decorations everywhere and so much bustling activity from locals preparing for the festivities. We loved just sitting on street corners watching the locals. In the evening of the Dia de Muertos there was a parade on the central Plaza Borda (Zocalo) and a very happy and easy atmosphere. In the morning of Dia de Muertos we went to the Taxco cemetery Pantheon to see all the locals bring flowers and decoration for their family graves, clean them, have picnic there and enjoy the day remembering their passed away family member. The non-stop line of white beetle taxis going to the crowded area in front of the cemetery was a sight in itself. The cemetery is worth the visit any day. It\\'s one big maze of graves without any structure at all. You literally have to climb over and walk on the graves to move around in there. \\n\\nThe Santa Prisca cathedral on Plaza Borda is amazing and reflects the enormous wealth from the silver mines around Taxco. The restaurants on Plaza Borda are rather touristy and a bit overprized. We went to smaller places away from the center with cheap and good roasted chicken: &quot;Pollo asado&quot;.\\n\\nWe liked the Indian Market next to the cathedral even more. You get lost in there and can spend hours looking at the many cramped-in stalls with colorful products. We went there several times during our 3-days stay in the city. \\n\\nThe Christ monument overlooking the city is also well worth the visit. It\\'s a steep ride up there and the view is breathtaking. You can basically see everything in the city. \\n\\nOne of the most fascinating things about Taxco is the 200 white beetle taxis that climb the steep streets of the city. They must be geared differently to ride those streets. It\\'s really amazing and I think we took 100 pictures of the Taxco taxis alone!\\n\\nWe didn\\'t visit any silver stores and felt that part of Taxco was a bit too touristy for us. \\n\\nWe walked the small streets at night and always felt safe. \\n\\nTaxco is one of the special &quot;Pueblos Magicos&quot; in Mexico and it deserves it. It\\'s spectacular, surprising, heart-warm and safe. We hardly saw any western tourists there, but it seemed to be a popular place for the Mexicans to spend Dia de Muertos.\\n\\nWe normally stay far away from very touristy places, but we loooooove Taxco", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zocalo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0d/67/dd/plaza-borda-taxco-catedral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Taxco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "124359718": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A place to find good restaurants.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150803-d256090-Reviews-Zocalo-Taxco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0d/67/dd/plaza-borda-taxco-catedral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is a stop you must make when traveling though Taxco.

What enhances both the Plaza and Taxco altogether is that nothing is allowed to be altered in favour of tourism, money or just plain old easier living. The houses, the buildings, the central square are all amazing, but the jewel in the square\\'s crown is the Iglesia de Santa Prisca. Standing in a corner of the Plaza, this magnificent church, with its Churrigueresque facade and ornate sculptures, dominates Taxco. No expense was spared in its construction between 1751 and 1758. The church, with its solid silver sculptures inside,was paid for by Joseph de la Borda, who had made his own fortune by discovering important and large deposits of silver around Taxco.

As we were lucky enough to visit during Epiphany many locals were having their children baptised or blessed. In addition, there was a full Catholic Mass with several priests participating. It was a very uplifting spiritual experience. Everyone in the congregation was most welcoming and didn\\'t seem to mind that they had been invaded by tourists! They were all beautifully dressed in honour of Epiphany.  My husband and I were respectably dressed in 3/4 trousers. I wore a short-sleeved top and my husband wore a  short-sleeved shirt.

Luckily , we entered this church in the square of Tasco and there was a guy there who for a small donation explained to us the history of this church . It was built by a french guy named Borda who came to Mexico looking for his brother Francisco. He found his brother who at that time already owned a gold as well as a silver mine. When Francisco died he left the mines to his brother . The brother  has 2 children , a son who became a priest and a daughter who became a nun. He was the one who had this church built in honor of Sta. Prisca  (Priscilla) He hired 4 architects to draw the design and had 2500 workers executing and building the church. The only condition he gave to the archbishop in building the church was to permit his son to be the first priest assigned there . The main altar depicts Christ  apostles and the pope at that time , the heart of Jesus , Sta Prisca and the Virgin Mary . On the left side of the altar , the bishops and on the right side the cardinals . The facade of the church is also beautiful and it was the one that attracted us to enter it. It is sad that it seems the concern of our tour guide from WAYAK TOUR was just to bring us to a silver store. One of the member of our tour even commented that &quot; it was a long way just to go to a silver shop&quot;  The square of Tasco is lined with stores selling silver but the guide brought us to one shop and that was all and then took us to a restaurant for lunch at 3:00 p.m which we declined as we have taken ours in our first stop .", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Santa Prisca de Taxco", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/54/a4/76/santa-prisca-cathedral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Plaza Borda", "addressLocality": "Taxco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "163090023": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Mexican barroque", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150803-d152692-Reviews-Santa_Prisca_de_Taxco-Taxco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/54/a4/76/santa-prisca-cathedral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A great example of the Mexican barroque that shows the wealth produced by the exploitation of silver during 3 centuries, at least.
