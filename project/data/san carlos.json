Based on previous reviews , I brought back pack with water and camera, sturdy hiking shoes and a hiking pole.

I did not see a distinct trail to the saddle between the peaks or the north peak. Lower third is easy but with numerous false trails that peter out. The middle third has a lot of fist-sized loose rocks within the trail which changes to fine sand in the upper third so gloves or poles are strongly recommended if you are an occasional hiker.

It had something for everyone. There were tunnels and caves to explore along with beautiful palm trees and cactus. And if you are into geology  you will love it. There are a few small water holes but sadly no flowing water for waterfalls in March. Those must be during the winter months. \\nNow to share the tips and info. \\nThe cost to hike is 30 pesos per person. I didn\\u2019t see a way to pay with credit card. \\nI would say it starts easy and goes to moderate with a few strenuous stretches in there. My husband and I are in our early 50\\u2019s with 3 kids from 12-19. We are mostly\\nmoderate hikers and this place was the perfect adventure. I often wear hiking sandals but glad I had hiking shoes on to keep the small pebbles out. \\nWe hiked on a weekday so there was no zip-lining but there were also hardly any others on the trail which was a plus for us. \\nListen to instructions about the trails (spoken in broken English) it helped us understand what to do. \\nAfter hiking about 700 meters the trail forks and you have 2 options. Both trails have a dead-end. This is not a loop. We went up the trial on the right first. It ends after climb up the tunnel. (Which isn\\u2019t easy to find through the trees.) Then we came back to the fork and went up the left side to the oasis. This is the most strenuous trail. This is where the ladder part comes in. It\\u2019s cabled into the rock so we felt comfortable going up. After this there are lots of large boulders to climb around and over to get to the oasis. I\\u2019m glad we were the only ones on the trail at this point so we were able to take our time. \\nBring lots of water and go first thing in the morning to avoid the heat and sun. We hiked on an overcast day so the weather was perfect. \\nWe spent about 2 1/2 hours but we took our time and explored both trails. We would have lingered even longer if we had brought snacks for the trail. Kids get hungry while hiking! \\nIf you are in San Carlos and have an extra morning don\\u2019t miss this adventure.

So we arrived at 8 AM, and the staff arrived shortly thereafter. \\n\\nAfter setting up, we were ready to go. They have a number of options for you at various prices. They have five zip lines in total that cross from one side of the canyon to the other. They also have two short rope bridges to cross, and an option to rappel. We opted for the four zip lines and two bridges. The cost per person was very reasonable, and much less expensive than one would pay in the US. Bring cash. \\n\\nThey suit you up in the straps that you sit on, together with the two pulleys that go on the cables. They also provide a helmet and thick leather gloves. I was especially concerned about safety, so I asked a lot of questions. We had ziplined once before in Germany, and they provided training and a similar set of gear. The main difference, however was that in Germany, there was only one line and the staff did not go with you. (granted, the distances were much shorter in Germany). We had two staff members accompany us, which was very important. One staff member went first, then the other stayed and launched us. \\n\\nThe other aspect that made this zip line very safe is that there are two lines. One main line, and one safety line. Each cable is attached to the canyon wall by three thick bolts. So, basically, there are six attachments in total, at each end. It appeared very safe to me. Also, the staff (we had Amarantha and Elei (sp?)) were great. They made sure we were attached to something at all times when we were high on the cliff side. We felt very safe and in good hands. If you survive, don\\'t forget to tip the staff generously. \\n\\nWe highly recommend this experience. For me, it was an experience of a lifetime. It was scary, safe, and FUN! In total, it took about an hour and a half for our family of four. There is a bit of a climb, so no flip flops obviously, also wear sensible clothes.
