But the bus was just 10 pesos per person one way, which is a good deal. Plus it is certainly a life experience! If you are renting an apartment, or someplace with a grill, it is the perfect Sunday outing to choose your favorite red snapper, or mahi mahi or shrimp.

I have buying the fish for my restaurant daily for two years now and my clients can all notice the difference in what is truly fresh as opposed to restaurants that purchase from distributors. \\nI disagree with the local reviewer who states the market is not clean also in their wishing there were more varieties. There are always over 20 different types of fish alone, at times they do not have certain types of fish but through no fault of their own. If the fish like Yellow Fin Tuna for example are not running the fisherman will bring in other types. \\nIt is kind of sad that a local restaurant owner would give a negative review to the fish market which allows them to drive less than one mile to purchase the freshest fish for the best price. Restaurants that are further away most all go through distributors and offer fish which have been on ice and in coolers for days. Granted the fish are still of a high quality and around the world this is how restaurants operate but it is not the same as caught in the early morning and served the same day.  \\nFor the restaurants who do take advantage of the fresh fish market their catch of the day was actually caught that day, and what a difference a day makes.\\nKent Eva\\u2019s Brickhouse Restaurant", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Cruz de Huanacaxle Fish Market", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/61/99/17/la-cruz-de-huanacaxle.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle del Mar #4", "addressLocality": "La Cruz de Huanacaxtle", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "188844459": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "EXCELLANT MARKET", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g1026781-d3335287-Reviews-La_Cruz_de_Huanacaxle_Fish_Market-La_Cruz_de_Huanacaxtle_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/61/99/17/la-cruz-de-huanacaxle.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "THis is a great market.

The washrooms are clean but my son said in one of the men\\'s stalls there was no toilet paper.

There were a few stalls selling veggies but not many.\\n\\nAt the front of the Marina food stall they were selling tangerine juice for 70 pesos for a venti size but if you go towards the opposite end of the Marina, a different stall was selling orange juice for only 25 pesos but grande size. The OJ was sweet and very good for only 25 pesos.\\n\\nUnfortunately we had a huge breakfast at the condo before we went to the market otherwise we would have liked to eat at the Market. \\n\\nThis is one market not to be missed as it is definitely a FEAST for the eyes and mouth!\\n\\nAfter we finished the Marina area, we walked a very short distance and found a small local artisan flea market type in the town center square.

I had empanadas, my hubby enjoyed a pork sandwich &amp;  our daughter found Indian (yes, authentic). All delicious &amp; very reasonably priced. The people were a happy, polite mix of many backgrounds, mostly Spanish, US &amp; Canadians. Lots of families. Arrive early, it gets crowded. Also, the fish market looked wonderful. It was clean &amp; full of many varieties &amp; sizes. Sadly, we were leaving early the next day, so we didn\\'t partake.

The market is only on Sundays make sure you go early because it gets extremely busy but it does run all day. The market is right on the boardwalk of the marina. The marina is one of the nicest marinas in the entire Banderas Bay. The marina has free Wi-Fi clean showers to amazing restaurants, one being Frascati, and the other la pesca. I think that Frascati is an amazing Italian restaurant from the servers to the recipes and the view you get when you sit by the window. It is an open balcony so if it\\'s windy bring a sweater, although my grandma didn\\'t have a sweater and the waiter brought a cashmere throw blanket to put around her. That was very classy in my opinion. The marina also has a great staff that speaks a little bit of English so you can ask questions that are necessary for getting around or getting help. I recommend this marina, and anyone who wants to may take a day trip to Puerto Vallarta or Sayulita can do so, via and Autobus, taxi or if you have a rental car, it is a 30 minute drive. La Cruz also has many great restaurants to dine at which served between 15 pesos to 110 pesos with excellent service and all have Wi-Fi.

We first went to a spot for snorkeling and while the swimming was not difficult, as the boat was anchored in a fairly-protected cove, the sighting of fish was not good, as this time of year the bay is kind of beat-up so the water is very cloudy. We managed to see some angelfish and starfish, but not too much else. When the 4-year old got seasick, Captain Justin was right there with a bucket and towels and reassuring words both for the little girl and her mother! \\n\\nWe then set sail and went around the bay. While we knew that it was late in the year for whale watching, somehow Captain Justin found them and we watched a great show for about 20 minutes. They were pretty far from the boat but nonetheless we were able to see them breach and see the huge splashes. There was much cheering and shouting during the display. None of us had been on a sailboat before so it was great to watch Justin and Jonathan work the sails and deal with the wind and waves. After our 4-hour adventure we returned to the marina through really choppy and windy conditions so it became even more of an adventure.

They train newbies like me and also top racers from around the world. The Bay of Banderas is a sailors paradise. The wind picks up like clockwork every afternoon. Beautiful setting. If you ever thought about learning to sail, this is the place to learn. The sailboat that I used was a 26-footer...big enough to be a solid boat and yet easy enough to handle. It was just me and the instructor on the boat.\\n\\nIt is an &quot;intensive&quot; program...as it is sailing and more sailing. A combination of some basic theory so you understand some of the &quot;why&quot; of sailing (about 1 hour per day in the late morning) and then the hands-on &quot;how&quot; of actually sailing on the water (about 3-4 hours per day in the afternoon). \\n\\nI had zero sailing experience prior to these 3-days...and I (at 61 years of age) left feeling reasonably comfortable sailing a boat on the open-water by myself. Amazing...going from a newbie to a &quot;sailor&quot; in 3 days. It was an enjoyable 3 days, but it was not an easy 3 days. A lot to digest and apply, and you will (if like me, struggle at times). The sailing terminology takes some getting use to...for that we can blame the British :-). But trust me, if I can do it, you can do it. \\n\\nMy instructor (Alex) was outstanding. A very good communicator; bilingual with excellent English. Very patient. Pushes you to learn and do more; and positive influence if/when you struggle. Alex loves teaching and it shows. Also extremely safety conscious. He has a tremendous amount of experience, and shares it in a clear manner.

We didn\\'t start in the classroom memorizing terminology (thank God! They would have lost me from the start); instead, ISA emailed an info packet after booking, and the course begins outside on the dock - feeling the wind and looking around the marina, already bringing to life the concepts from the info packet. I was lucky enough to be the only student for the week, and I was made to feel very comfortable by the experienced instructor, Alejandro/Alex. \\n\\nThe pacing of the program was very good \\u2014 each day progressed in such a manner that just as I was beginning to feel comfortable with the knowledge I had received, more content was added on to it. This makes the program &quot;intensive&quot;, but it allowed me to push myself and keep a great pace of continued learning throughout the 3 days. By the end of it, I now feel 100% comfortable handling a sailboat out on the water, and I have a basic understanding of the science and technical aspects of sail power and how to control the sails to maximize speed or have a comfortable cruise. \\n\\nMy background was that I had zero experience sailing before the program, and maybe I\\'d gone out with a sailor friend once or twice over the past ten years. Hopefully this inspires you to take the program if you\\'re thinking about it. It was a big part of my vacation in Puerto Vallarta. The ISA staff were friendly and knowledgeable, even popping by some of the classroom sessions to lend some added insight. Great syllabus, drills, and teaching style. They need to promote the program better on the website, but I jumped at the opportunity and learned a new skill that I\\'ll take with me forever.

Our dive was really good, we saw so many fish and had a lovely dive. The snorkeling was not as good. Now, I don\\'t really blame Alex for this, but it has to be noted. \\n\\nWe went to Los Arcos National Park, which is a beautiful spot. Unfortunately, it became overcrowded to the point of being dangerous. It was a very busy week because it was holy week (the same week as Easter), so there were almost 50 boats. Many of the boats didn\\'t drop their anchors and instead used their engines to maneuver back and forth. There were fumes from all the engines. There were so many snorkelers, they were nearly on top of each other. It became dangerous to go from the boats to the snorkeling area because of all the boats with their engines on to keep their place. The snorkelers in our group had enough so we were unable to go on our second dive.\\n\\nI guess I can\\'t recommend a mixed group. The group stuck on the boat waiting for our dive to end was miserable and the two divers were unhappy losing out on our second dive that we paid for.\\n\\nBut, Alex was wonderful to work with leading up to the excursion. He was also great to dive with. I think under different circumstances, he would have been great for the snorkelers as well. There was a member of the snorkel group who was uneasy about snorkeling and because of the overcrowded conditions, she will not try snorkeling again. As I said, I don\\'t blame Alex for this. The government should put limits put on how many can go to this site. \\n\\nAlex made us a lovely lunch. We had a wonderful salad with avocado and grilled chicken. He also had water, juice, fresh fruit and bread. \\n\\nThe ride to Los Arcos was about 45 minutes and beautiful. I think at a less busy time of year, this would be an ideal spot. \\n\\nI would love to give Blue Tortuga another try, but I would not go with a mixed group again, unless we went to an island or a beach where the snorkelers could get off the boat.

Captain Mike was very pleasant and professional to work with in setting up the booking and planning the itinerary. He was prompt in his responses and very open to accommodate and customize the day for us. In the end, we settled on a sail to Yelapa as half of us had not visited there before.\\n\\nIndian Summer is a lovely sailing yacht - clean, well maintained and very comfortable.  It can accommodate up to 14 but we were happy to be a group of 8 as there was plenty of room for everyone to be comfortable in the shade of the bimini or to stretch out on the bow in the sun. Captain Mike provided a great selection of beverages and we brought our own wine. Michelle served up guacamole followed and a small but  delicious chicken burrito as a snacks on the sail (motor actually) across to Yelapa. Partway on the sail to Yelapa Mike had a confession...our shoes had been accidentally left behind on the dock in La Cruz! No one was overly fussed but Michelle took all of our shoe sizes and by the time we landed in Yelapa we were fitted out with new sandals courtesy of Red Dolphin Sailing Charters.\\n\\nJuan toured us around the village and up to the falls (not much to see there during the dry season) and then we spent a little time on the beach enjoying the sun, water and  cervazas before returning to Indian Summer for a yummy fish lunch with Mikes secret sauce!  As promised and on cue the wind came up as we left Yelapa and we had the most fantastic sail all the way across to La Cruz!! The seasoned sailors among us were duly impressed - Captain Mike knew exactly how to take maximum advantage of the wind and still have a comfortable sail. It was exhilarating.\\n\\nI recommend a sail with Red Dolphin Sailing Charters - it\\'s a first class, authentic sailing experience with truly genuine people that are a pleasure to spend a day with. We\\'ll book again for sure.

The boat was very comfortable and the crew attentive.\\n\\nThe best part, and you can never tell how this will play out, was the breaches right in front of us.  We had breaches and breaches - about twenty of them!  We had a mom with her newborn and then a pair of adult whales that did many - including a double breach.  It was really fantastic!  My husband is working on getting some video from his GoPro on to youtube - he will name it Red Dolphin.  \\n\\nI highly recommend spending a day of your vacation with these guys...we will each year we return!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Red Dolphin Sailing Charters", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/4c/c1/6d/red-dolphin-sailing-charters.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Marina Riviera Nayarit", "addressLocality": "La Cruz de Huanacaxtle", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "63550", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "253105890": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Whale of a tail!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g1026781-d3898986-Reviews-Red_Dolphin_Sailing_Charters-La_Cruz_de_Huanacaxtle_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/4c/c1/6d/red-dolphin-sailing-charters.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Great trip!

Red Dolphin was recommended to us by a good friend and it was an unforgettable experience. Captain Mike and his partner Michelle are amazing hosts, extremely knowledgeable and both of them kept us thoroughly entertained throughout the trip. The Red Dolphin is a beautiful yacht, very luxurious and easily accommodated our group of 9. We had an absolutely wonderful day sailing and our visit to Yelapa was so much fun. We are already talking about where we want to go on our next sailing charter. And make no mistake, we will definitely hire Red Dolphin again and again. Thanks guys.

The captain has so many stories to tell as well as live advices to give. The girl in charge is such a darling and the crew is so cool. \\n\\nGuys, take the chance to go with Red Dolphin.
