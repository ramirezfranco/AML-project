But the unorganized, unprofessional and unbelievably rude staff we encountered here make this place almost not worth visiting. For the last day of the trip &amp; her birthday, she wanted to visit the Frida Kahlo museum. We both went to art schools and Frida is one of her favorite artists since high school, so this visit was supposed to be the highlight of our trip. The process for this was a bit weird and complicated, where she had to first email the museum, then follow up with two letters: one officially asking for a tour &amp; another thanking them for the said tour in advance. Our guided visit was scheduled for 10am, which is also when the museum opens. We had to talk to two other staff members until someone finally let us in to pay for our tickets &amp; guided tour.

At this point it was around 10:45am, and all these people who arrived before us kept going into the museum, even though we planned ahead and made an appointment for 10am.

However the earliest ticket they have available on the website is 10:30 a.m., though the museum opens at 10:00 a.m. If you want to get in at 10:00 a.m. you have to show up probably around 9:a.m  and wait on the non-ticketed line until the museum opens at 10:00 a.m. Learned a couple of things that I didn't know such as how Diego Rivera dabbled in cubism,   and Frida had a day bedroom and a night bedroom! The only annoyance is obviously how crowded it can get, and you can not avoid that unless you show up at 9am get in at 10am, and sort of rush through the museum, but then who wants to do that?!", " Coyoacan is a great place to spend the day and this museum should be just one part of it.", " We were very excited to visit this museum and ordered tickets online in advance. I highly recommend doing this or you will wait in 2 long lines to enter the small museum, instead of one.", " Another part of the museum that was truly annoying is the way they do the Q.

If you are not Spanish speaking,  then check to see if audio guides are available because most of the exhibits on the museum's in side are in Spanish.", " You can see the ruins for free from the outside of the museum; however, the underground museum is excellent. The museum has quite a few impressive artifacts, and we found it to be a nice complement to the Anthropology museum.", " A world class museum! Proud of it!", " Due to the many explanatory signs I actually learned a lot and the museum itself comes up with spectacular pieces that can compete with the ones at the Anthropology Museum.", " When I saw the outdoor of the museum, I thought it is only some ruins. The museum has more inside the building, lots of interesting stuff to see!", "This museum has a mix of actually exploring the templo mayor and an indoor museum with artifacts from the ruins.", "Personally, given the choice between this museum and the cathedral, I'd choose the museum every time.", "there is a lot to be seen and read here, and worth the fee to head down the stairs through the museum.", "Awesome site, cool museum included with admission.", " Museum itself with explanation in English but recommend to use a local guide at very reasonable price.", " The museum on the grounds was much larger than I thought it would be.", "Went on a your that included this museum.", " This museum was our sweet surprise this vacation. It wasn't even on our list to see initially .... glad we went. This is an archeological site with a museum attached. It is well maintained with nice bathrooms.", " Blown away by this amazing archaeological site and adjacent museum right in the middle of the historical center of the city. Because of the aforementioned things it was a very creepy / somber walk through but the museum did very well in presenting the history of the archaeology itself, which I found to be a fascinating and different take on a ruins site/museum! In the museum we were able to follow along with the timeline of when various artifacts were discovered and the teams who worked to preserve/present them. Also a highlight was the cool diorama of the greater historical area we were in, with every place each artifact came from; ie -- this was under that cathedral, this one came from under these buildings, etc...", " The museum was great and takes about an hour to go through at a rapid pace... allow more time if you want to read everything! Very reasonable price to visit the museum too!", " I have to admit, I gladly paid the admission to Templo Mayor thinking we were going to tour the site and that was it. I didn't realize there was a world class museum of artifacts as well. The museum was one of the best museums I'd ever been to.", " I didn't realize there was a world class museum of artifacts as well. The museum was one of the best museums I'd ever been to.

Do yourself a favor and don't miss out on this one.", " The museum itself has some really nice items, displayed very nicely. It is not modern with all the interactive stuff you see in the newest museums but it is not a stuffy old museum.", " I was amazed by the ruins and the content within the museum. Within the museum you'll find many artifacts from both the Aztecs and the Spaniards. However, the museum is designed in a bit of a maze with many steps and a slow elevator.", "You cannot miss this Aztec Site and Museum.", " Don\u2019t miss the walk through the archaeological site and the adjacent museum. The museum is engaging and well designed.", " What you will see at this museum, is an excellent glimpse of the time before the conquest, the museum has palace pieces of the Aztec culture. More on my introduction.", " The Museo del Templo Mayor really is a &quot;must&quot; for visitors to Mexico City. It's an impressive site outside but it's the exhibitions inside the museum that are most memorable. It is an intriguing glimpse into the one part of Mexico's fascinating history. It's quite a compact museum and centrally located, so it could easily be done in half a day or even just a few hours if you're pressed for time.", " A museum which is fascinating (takes a good 2 hours to see it well), but it palls in comparison to the incomparable Museum of Anthropology in Chapultepec Park.", " The museum itself is much better than expected. The layout itself is very interesting, divided as the actual temple was; the right half dedicated to war, human sacrifice and death. We'd spent the previous day at the National Museum of Anthropology (Museo Nacional de Antropologia), and the Templo Mayor museum definitely rounded out/supplemented what we'd learned the day before.", "The museum is fantastic.", " To go inside the walled off outside ruins and the museum/small gift shop, there is an entry near a plaza with large sculptures. The museum has ruins/artifacts in it. We were told there is a pyramid there, but all there is is a small replica. The museum is 4 stories, and you can from above at some artifacts. The museum is interesting, but if you are short on time or money, you could skip it and just view for free what you can see of the outside ruins, which is a fair amount.", " Also, make sure you take your time in the museum.", "It's a great museum.", " In fact, we may just skip the anthropology museum for other sites, as this museum is just so extensive in it's collection. Beautiful and we'll done displays of artifacts with excavations as part of the grounds.", " A visit to Mexico City without visiting the excavations and museum of the ancient Aztec temple in Mexico City is just incomplete. The museum and archeological excavations will give the visitor an opportunity in understanding the very interesting history of Mexico and its amazing capital. The  museum's exhibition is outstanding, a must when visiting Mexico's capital.", " The museum and archeological excavations will give the visitor an opportunity in understanding the very interesting history of Mexico and its amazing capital. The  museum's exhibition is outstanding, a must when visiting Mexico's capital.", " After you've finished traversing the elevated walkways of the Templo Mayor itself, occupying the very same spaces the ancient Aztec priests did so long ago, practicing  their elaborate rituals interpreting their fiendishly complex but profound religion, enter the museum just a few paces away to help you bring it all together. If you can, you should see this museum BEFORE you head across town to see the National Museum of Anthropology, because the Museum of the Templo Mayor will give you a very good introduction to the time in Mexico's history when the Aztecs reigned supreme. Visit the museum's web site to learn more about its specific exhibits. When I visited the museum in late April 2017, one small area was closed for renovation and neither of the two elevators were working so this would have made it difficult for people in wheelchairs, but the bathrooms were perfectly clean and in good working order (always a plus with me.) One can go through the entire museum easily within the space of 90 minutes or so, give or take 30 depending on your level of interest. Then, take a stroll over to the corner of the block overlooking the temple itself (address: Terraza de la Liberia Porrua, Republica de Argentina 17, Centro) where there is a bookstore on the corner. Go in, locate the elevator and this will take you to the rooftop restaurant called &quot;El Mayor,&quot; where you can sit at a table overlooking the ruins of the temple itself with the towers and domes of the Metropolitan Cathedral partially visible as well, and have a fresh hot cup of good Mexican coffee. -Or a drink, or a meal. Service is slow so don't be shy about signalling your wait-person and letting them know you're on a tight schedule and need to order or get your check (whether you're REALLY rushed for time or not, or you might wait a long, LONG time...) \n     In a nutshell, I heartily recommend this museum, as it is well worth seeing.", " There's also an area where you can see some of the ruins outside of the museum. The museum is located next to the National Cathedral this is a must do when you're in Mexico City", " The museum takes you through the beginning when they first inhabited the island in the middle of Lake Texcoco through the conquest by Hernan Cortes.

It is also located just off the Zocalo", " Lots of artifacts to see in the museum. I liked the way the museum was laid out. It was a good restroom stop, too.", " Amazing place to visit after the church and BEFORE the National Museum of Anthropology. You will see lots of things discovered in this temple on display in the museum.", " We weren't expecting to find such a large museum after touring the ruins themselves. It houses a great collection, is very well organized and designed, and is (in my opinion) comparable to the National Anthropology Museum in terms of must-see museums in the city.", " Easily one of the best museums I've experienced, and I believe the best with regards to the pre-conquest history of Mexico City. Exhibits begin outdoors with paths through and around excavated temples, then leads inside into the museum itself. Most of the major marques and description panels will have both Spanish and English translations, but mostly all of the minor one will be in Spanish only. While non-Spanish speakers/readers can hire an interpreter outside the museum, we didn't find it to be necessary. Be sure to allow at least three hours to this museum, preferably more to give it justice.", "because the museum inside is pretty impressive, too.", " The museum at the end has multiple levels.", " I think you need to see both as this museum shows you the amount of time that people inhabited this area, while teotihuacan gives a more impressive complete picture. The inside museum has many of the artifacts that were unearthed during the excavation and is extremely well organized. It is to date my favorite museum.", " The museum is beautiful and well thought out. Without seeing the museum, the outside walk-about has little meaning.", " This museum also has special exhibits.

The museum will take time to navigate, it is at least 3 stories.", " One of my favourite books is 'AZTEC' by Cook; and visiting this Museum/Temple brought to life the words that i have imagined. Located off the main Plaza, I recommend this museum to those interested in Mexico's history.", " Don't spend too much time in the museum though, there are more ruins to see after the museum! They placed the museum portion right in the middle of the tour.", "This gem of a museum is a little bit hidden, but very much worth a visit.", " Visited here on our first day of vacation. The museum is full of artifacts that allow us to understand better the fascinating history of Mexico.", " The quality of this museum is again fantastic! Tourists do not have a choice of an audio guide that can help them truly understand and appreciate that the wonderful collection the curators of the museum have pulled together. But take nothing away from the quality of the museum itself. It is fantastic.", " My husband actually enjoyed this museum more than the Museum of Anthropology. Even the kids enjoyed it.", " I wasn't expecting much but the ruins have been well kept and the museum is even better. Spent hours here altogether as the museum was over 3 floors.", " The outside part of the museum is interesting especially with an audio guide. The more impressive part I found inside the museum, from the way things are place and lightened, with all the historic explanations and the amazing sculptures!", " The site is well posted in both Spanish and English, as is the museum. The museum is outstanding and has loads of information about the area and the people who inhabited it.", " But there was much more to see at the excavation site than we expected and the associated museum was very good, with almost everything provided with English translation for those of us who are linguistically limited. I would (and did) rate this a much better experience that the Anthropology Museum for that reason, even though the other museum is larger and has a more extensive collection.", " The museum is large and easy to navigate. Everyone should see it!", "This site is definitely not as impressive as many but the attached museum is great.", "Going in, we were under the impression the museum was all outside.", "My husband particularly enjoyed this museum.", " This museum &amp; ruins are well worth visiting. The museum has a huge display of artifacts &amp; are brilliantly exhibited. We loved it.", " Part of the museum is an open air self-guided walking tour of the temple area.

I loved it and have been several times.", " The museum is also interesting and big. The ticket to the museum is 60 pessos and they accept cards.", " If you do this museum get a guide otherwise your looking at artifacts you won't understand fully. The artifacts found are laid out in this museum giving the guest a look at what this culture was cab able of.", "This is the other great museum in Mexico city; a must see!", " It is however attached to a museum that's interesting but not as great as the Anthropology museum. If you are short on money or time do the Anthropology museum instead of this.", " It's a requisite if you are in Mexico City to see the uncovered ruins, but if you go to the Museum of Anthropology first, this won't be as impressive.

We were a group of four travelling together and we thoroughly enjoyed the museum - and photography was allowed both inside and outside the museum.", " This is an amazing museum but you must see the site first.

Then you head into the museum where you continue to learn about the history of what you have just witnessed.", " The museum of the great Aztec temple has two parts, the archeological excavation and the museum building where some of the more important pieces are housed.

The indoor museum features Aztec art which consists, mostly, of pieces recovered from the dig.", " If you've ever gone to Chichen-Itza or Teotihuacan (to be fair) the ruins here are not surprising, I mean there are a few things here and there but what is totally worth it is getting inside the museum.

Also they currently have a Martin Luther king Jr exhibit that just brings into perspective the current issues facing the USA.", " I've been to this museum with my best friend and it is a thrilling experience. I adore this museum and have told everyone I know to go visit it, my father had the chance to go see the Martin Luther King temporal exhibit and was touched to the soul.

A must for anyone visiting the city.", "Amazing European quality museum.", " I went to this museum on a whim while riding the Touribus, as it stops right outside.

It's designed in a very organized and modern way.", " Obviously (and fortunately) not really Mexican as the topic of the Museum is the genocides of the last century. The Museum is well done in a modern and interesting building.", " I was walking around downtown when I saw a small entrance to this museum, I was really amazed by the beauty of the building once inside, the museum is dedicated to the genocides of the world, it has a permanent exposition on the holocaust and has many items and rooms of the theme.", " I was walking around downtown when I saw a small entrance to this museum, I was really amazed by the beauty of the building once inside, the museum is dedicated to the genocides of the world, it has a permanent exposition on the holocaust and has many items and rooms of the theme. it is not a well-known museum so it doesn't get many visitors but the lack of popularity is what makes this museum really great. the cost is around 6 dollars and you can choose to rent a hearing device with the explanation (recommended), it has a gift shop and you can take pictures. it is not for kids since the material is very explicit and hard on the soul. you can plan your downtown trip and getting to this museum at last since it doesn't get very crowded.", " My family and I were so amazed by the quality and content of this museum that we are definitely considering returning the next time we visit Mexico City. The guided tours are the best way of getting to know the generalities of the museum, so you can return and spend additional time in the areas that were of most interest for you.", " I walked by -not looking for this museum and decided to check it out as I had some free time. The name      ( memory and tolerance ) doesn't really prepare you for the content of the museum .", " This museum is very close to Palacio de Bellas Artes and just across the street from Almeda Park. About half of the museum is about the Nazis with the other half dedicated to various genocides around the world. The museum is not too big so it shouldn't take more than 2 hours.", " I would never have expected to find a holocaust museum in Mexico - of all places! I was pleasantly surprised - the set up of the museum is extraordinary. That in itself was worth seeing - I was personally surprised to see the scale of what was done. Only brickbat is that all the exhibits are in Spanish - and you have to rely on the audio (I got the English one) to get a better understanding of what is on display.", " This museum is out of this world!

As the name suggests - the museum is dedicated to two topics : Memory and Tolerance. Visit of this museum is a very powerful and moving  history lesson and if you are in Mexico city   - you should see it.", " The museum is there  to make people reflect on making a difference in the world and taking a stand to not let things like this happen ever again, even if human suffering is happening still and in the present time. There are a few interactive games and activities, a cute big area where kids can be taken care of and they can play while parents go around the museum. The museum has an amazing array of artifacts and real historical objects all over the museum.", " Visiting this museum was very moving. Exploring genocides of the 20th century, it helped me understand the more subtle causes/conditions that lead to such human suffering. The first part of the museum took us about 2 hours to move through. The tolerance part of the museum doesn't quite have the same coverage with the English audio guide as the memory part though by then, we were getting full anyway. Might be a good attraction to break up into two visits (or six...).", " The first part of the museum took us about 2 hours to move through. The tolerance part of the museum doesn't quite have the same coverage with the English audio guide as the memory part though by then, we were getting full anyway.", " Although not your typical idea of a tourist museum, the Museum of Tolerance was a very moving and emotional experience. The majority of the museum focused on The Halocaust, but there were other examples of genocide such as Darfur, Serbia which were also very moving.", " I went to the museum and I was very amazed by the great production that the museum had.

And it has a very interesting little museum of the city, too.", " The Dolores Olmedo museum is located far down south and best combined with a day tour at the floating gardens in nearby Xochimilco but it is WELL WORTH your time and true art lovers will happily spend an entire day to marvel over the private collection that Mexican business woman and early philanthropist Dolores Olmedo gathered during her long life where artists like Rivera and Kahlo received generous support toward their art crearions. Home to over 170 paintings of Rivera and Kahlo alone, this museum also has a fascinating and HUGE collection of pre-hispanic art and sculptures, modern, contemporary, folk and colonial, in addition to extraordinary pieces in her private house that was also opened as an additional collection to the public after Olmedo's death in 2002.
