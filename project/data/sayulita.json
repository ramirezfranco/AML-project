The price and service were great.  \\n\\nSorry I don\\'t have the name of the restaurant (directly in front of the beach).  The town is small and the locals can point you in the right direction.

We did encounter a couple of people along the way, Europeans, who had a guide along with them.  Definitely not necessary to do with a guide, but just be sure to read my tip at the bottom of this review.\\n\\nWe took a taxi ($500pesos incl tip) from Nuevo Vallarta to Higuera Blanca, a small pueblo at the foot of the mountain.  \\n\\nOur taxi driver had to stop several times in the pueblo to ask for directions.  This was a blessing, however, as we stopped at a tienda, where we purchased another 1L bottle of water. This came in very handy, as the heat of the day required more hydration.  We had packed water, but we went through all of it by the end of our day.\\n\\nIt is a short walk (3 1/2 hrs total) easy for anyone in fairly good health.  We are mid fifties and in good shape, hiking and cycling at home.  The climb is not too steep, only a 400m increase in elevation.  There was a bit of scrambling over rocks at the end, nothing really difficult, if you are wearing proper hiking shoes.\\n\\nAlso, some people mentioned a lack of signage.  This was no problem at all, as we found the trail well marked, with signs along the way.\\n\\nThe views are spectacular, with the opportunity to see whales breaching out at sea...360% view of the Bah\\u00eda de Banderas.\\n\\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  There are no taxis back to Nuevo Vallarta or Bucer\\u00edas or anywhere for that matter.  Knowing some Spanish is a real asset, as I asked a couple of locals, who told us to flag down a bus.  This cost $31pesos each, taking us all the way back to Nuevo Vallarta.  We got off the bus at the Chedraui on the highway to pick up a few things, then took an Uber back to our condo.  The trip on the bus took over an hour, on the old winding highway.  \\n\\nNice diversion from sitting on a beach all day.

Unfortunately the smaller summit is well traveled and although easier it is about half the height.  This is about a 1000 foot climb and there are lots of tricky spots for those not use to trail walking.  I\\'d say advanced intermediate for skill and fitness levels. \\nIf you make it to the top of the wrong mountain top there\\'s a small trail leading off to the right at the top which will take you to the very farthest point.  Not terribly difficult but not for the faint of heart. We did this the one day and then the correct trail a few days later.  You can easily do both the same day if you make a mistake and you are very healthy.  That didn\\'t included anyone in my group.  We were all around 60 years old. \\n\\nTraveling there we took a taxi from el centro for 100 pesos.  There\\'s no cell service most of the time there and definitely none near Jaqueline Hacienda.  We ended up walking most of the way back until a taxi happened along.  This is about a three hour hike from the Hacienda and back with no errors in trail decisions.  Book a taxi for your return about 4 hours later and walk to the beach if you have extra time and back to the hacienda for your scheduled time.  \\n\\nLike the other reviews you will be crossing over gates etc.  The taxis may take you to the farthest point they can which will save you some time but it isn\\'t a bad walk. I\\'m guessing it won\\'t be for 100 pesos like we paid.  Tip:  when you get to the first place it seems like it will take you up to the mountain stay left don\\'t be tempted.  It looks like a washed out riverbed and it is wide. The trail to the left looks less used but when you come to a tree across the trail you will know you are on the right track.  After this point it is only well used where you are supposed to travel.

(MexiTreks also gives back to the community by helping to clear and maintain hiking trails and are upfront about where your tour fee goes.)\\n\\n- Most of the terrain is dusty and rocky. Wear shoes with good traction and apply sunscreen and insect repellent. \\n\\n- Be prepared for steep uphill climbs and downhill semi-crawls.

Someone had made a lean-to with palm fronds in the sand so we set up there and felt like we were castaways. The only caution is the surf. I saw other people mention it in their posts. There was a wicked undertow, so we never got more than knee deep, and even then there were times we had to fight to keep our footing.

Also a few concession stands and a bar on the approach road. Just like downtown locals will rent chairs and umbrellas and shrimp on a stick and trinkets will be offered. Amazingly there was a manned lifeguard tower! And a buoy line restricting swimmers. That was a good thing because the waves were big and the undertow strong.

You can search Sayulita Beach Water Quality. \\n- Want to go swimming or surfing but the beach is crowded? The beach of the dead - Playa Los Muertos - is only a 20 minute walk away from the beach or if you have a car La Lancha is a great option. You can also get a shuttle from wildmex for USD $20 return. \\n- Be conscious of your food, if your cooking at home buy the food antibacterial Microdym - even fruit/veg that has a skin you\\u2019re peeling off - soak it! You can use this for when you\\u2019re washing your dishes too.\\n- Always use your hand sanitizer, and be wary of your phone hygiene too.

Beautiful and amazing time, we should have stayed on property the entire week. We made the horrible decision to have a surfing excursion to Sayulita. We actually had a really fun time hanging out at El Break and Tigres were great surfing instructors, but fast forward 18 hours and 6 out of the 8 of us were vomiting back at our hotel with aches and chills. Only 3 of us entered the water, myself and my teenage son and daughter. Sadly, I always expect to get a little sick when traveling to Mexico. What happened to our group was beyond getting a little sick.  However, what happened days later when we returned to the States is truly unimaginable. We went to Sayulita on a Tuesday. By Sunday my teenage daughter was complaining of pain in her vagina. She could not urinate and was in tears just trying to move. On Monday I took her the pediatrician who recommended we go to the gynecologist immediately. Something did not look right during her clinical exam.  The gynecologist said the exact same thing. My daughter was raw on the inside, so the doctor took samples to send for culture. By Tuesday we were at the ER because her pain was so severe (one week after our excursion to Sayulita). They thought she had a UTI so she was put on an IV antibiotic and given narcotics for the pain. Fast forward 7 days later. My daughter has improved tremendously. We just received the results from the culture. She tested positive for having the enterococcus bacteria. Look it up, this in the water at high levels in Sayulita. This basically means we were swimming in feces.  Our gynecologist contacted the infectious disease center to make sure every precaution was taken to kill the bacteria and stop it from spreading and causing further issues. I cannot believe the Mexican government, both federal and local, allow this blatant disregard for public safety to occur.  Do not risk your health. Stay away from Sayulita.  Trust me. No person, let alone child, should suffer because they went to a beach and swam in the water.

The beach is horribly crowded and polluted, the town (at one point I am sure was charming) is overrun by tourists and locally run businesses are being replaced by Gringo owned restaurants/ shops that have no local flavor.  There are several beautiful towns nearby where we wished we had stayed.  The only thing we loved about our time there was getting up for a daily walk around the village (when well enough) at 6:30 am to see all the locals starting their day and enjoy the views and village before the crowds of tourists flooded the street.   Charm abruptly ended by 9:30 am.  Oh...we also enjoyed getting out of Sayulita whenever we were well enough to do so.\\n\\nThis place has totally lost all its charm.

Instead they booked us in another villa that was recently added to the property. 2nd, we were told that we had to climb a lot of stairs to get to our room (approx 123), and 3rd, the room had a partition between the bed and the bathroom. So already the vacation had a few strikes against us. After our first night, my husband got sick in the middle of the night waking up with a virulent bout of diarrhea and vomiting - this went on for hours until he lost consciousness, fell down and hit his head on the tiled-floor. I ran into the bathroom to find him lying on the floor with blood streaming down his face. Luckily the bleeding stopped and I was able to help him to bed.  I was spared with only a minor bout of vomiting but I am also a savvy traveler having been to many 3rd world countries. Long story short, we were traveling with our family who were staying at a private residence, but were still stricken with vomiting and diarrhea, so it wasn\\'t just at the place we were staying. Of the 7 days we were there, 5 of them were spent not eating much, and laying low. The pool at Villa Amor was the only thing that kept us going, because all we did was lie on the lounges. Then there is the extremely high prices that we were being charged for food, like ordering mashed potatoes and side of vegetables which cost $27 - but when you\\'re up 123 stairs, and sick, you\\'ll pay the asking price. When we were in Sayulita in 2014 for our son\\'s wedding, there were at least 50 people, and none of us got sick. Since then, Sayulita has become a popular destination for people looking for beach resorts, low prices and great weather. Unfortunately, Sayulita has become a filthy, disgusting and over--priced hell-hole. I will never, ever go back there -- it will take them years to get that city to a decent level of health. My biggest gripe is with the booking agencies, i.e., BookingDotCom who should have warned us before we booked our hotel, and the airlines should have been notified that there was an epidemic here. I\\'m sure there are many other great areas to visit other than Sayulita, such as San Pancho, which is very clean and less crowded, or Punta del Mita.

We have not been swimming in the ocean and we do take care to wash all fruits and vegetables before cutting or eating them. \\nWe have been to Mexico countless times on both the East and the West coast and I have never seen anyone this sick before. We ate the exact same things yesterday so I know it\\u2019s not food poisoning. I do hope this ends soon because he looks like a wrung out dish rag. Hopefully I won\\u2019t be updating this post because I came down with the same. \\nSayulita has a lot to offer but we won\\u2019t be back until they sort out the sewage problem.

Approx $25 usd to make a $300 withdrawl (ouch).  Come with plenty of Peso and a wad of usd to make your life easier.  Also, important to know that the ATMs often run out of money over the weekends and then you are stuck.  \\n2.  The street food is prolific and smells wonderful.  Do not eat it!  4 of the 5 people in our party had late night street tacos and were violently sick for 3 days.  The 1 person who held out was the only one who enjoyed the trip.\\n3.  If in Sayulita during the winter busy season, be sure to make reservations for dinner.  Many of the good restaurants fill up early.  Also, be prepared to pay in cash, even if the restaurant takes credit cards.  The network went down several times causing last minute payments in cash.\\n\\nMy overall impression is that Sayulita is a charming little town with alot to offer.

We swam there last year with no incident so blew this off as an American being too sensitive to a crowded Mexican beach.  I wish we had listened.\\n\\nWe spent a nice long day taking surf lessons and then swimming in the waves.

An hour later my daughter, followed by our toddler, my wife, and my bother and sister in law.  It came on quickly and was terrible.  The friends we were swimming  all day with us also collapsed.

It was a nightmare -- just the worst sort of sick.\\n\\nWe soon heard from locals that this was happening to so many families, always right after they swim.

I suppose its designation as a Pueblo Magico gives them the impression that it is alright to gouge the tourists.  I have been to several other Mexican cities that have the Pueblo Magico designation and Sayulita doesn\\'t hold a candle to these places. Service and attitude of waiters etc was terrible.

We walked through the festive streets- fun chill vibe with a big market going on, flags strung across that made for a great ambiance. Then we headed to the beach area which is very happening. Tons of people out surfing, hanging out at the beach, walking around. We stopped at el Break cafe and bar for margaritas. I loved the outside seating area amongst some big palm trees with large fabric pieces hung for shade. Blissful break! There were lots of peddlers coming by selling things so we had to say many times no thank you, but they weren\\'t overly aggressive and we were able to sit and enjoy our drinks.

The trip was great, I would recommend it, lots of good points but you should be aware of some of the negatives. Our trip started on the 9th of January, next time I would go in the period, the last two weeks of January to the first two weeks of February. The first part of our trip was loud and busy. Visitors are a very mixed bag, singles in their 20/30/40s, young families and retired but fit couples. We fall into the last category. Bring ear plugs, the bars are loud and stay open til 3 or 4 in the morning. We could not keep our windows open. Spoke with younger singles and they complained as well. Restaurants and food are great and reasonably priced. Roads are dusty so any restaurants with outside seating, you might want to stay away from busier streets. Lots of traffic, golf carts and atvs everywhere. The beach is nice, big waves, lots of vendors. You can just walk further down the beach to get away from the crowds but most people do not. Surprised that the water treatment plant runs their out water right into the ocean in the middle of the beach area and the out water did not look too clean. As mentioned, we walked a lot and felt very safe [just be careful to look for dog poop], dogs run freely everywhere. Fun because you are a visitor but there are lots of locals to share food carts and sights.

As far as the beach goes, yes it is a scenic setting with rugged jungle hills in the background. Be aware this is the open Pacific Ocean so waves break short and the beaches generally have a noticeable slope and can be a bit cooler - not the greatest for swimming. The sand is generally larger so maybe not as smooth as Florida or the Caribbean, for comparison. Local dogs roam the beaches here (yes they are friendly and cute) but they leave poop so step carefully! Constant loop of vendors - they have nice things and are willing to negotiate on prices but sometimes I just want to lay down and relax for a few minutes :-) \\n\\nMost troubling is that the town infrastructure hasn\\'t kept up with growth especially the sewer sytem. A recurring theme you will see on online forums is the reports of sewer smells and of murky water pouring from pipes directly into the town\\'s river that pours into the ocean right next to downtown Sayulita. This causes the ocean near downtown to smell bad, and since I don\\'t know if it is untreated or not, I avoided the ocean during my recent trip. It smelled and looked off to me, so I finally got into the water after walking about 10 minutes north to a more remote area farther from downtown.\\n\\nI really enjoyed it before when it was a sleepy little town where you could disappear and witness a slice of small town Mexican culture. But it has now gotten too popular with the party crowd so you can\\'t barely walk around town or find a place to eat that isn\\'t mobbed with people. Restaurants are getting shady by adding items you didn\\'t order or adding gratuity without telling you. And, I withdrew money from an ATM that charged (without showing it on the receipt) a $16 service charge, in addition to a ripoff exchange rate. Those are the types of tactics that drove me away from the bigger touristy areas in nearby Puerto Vallarta so it is sad to see those elements so prominent in Sayulita.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Sayulita Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/c5/24/8c/sayulita.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Sayulita", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "554594119": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Sayulita Beach", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g445056-d6467604-Reviews-Sayulita_Beach-Sayulita_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/c5/24/8c/sayulita.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The vibrant seaside town of Sayulita could be a lovely place to spend a Mexican holiday, but its success comes with serious drawbacks.  \\nThe town is booming and the infrastructure can\\u2019t keep up.

Then, I could choose between the main beach with lots of folks, beach vendors, perfect easy waves or I could walk 15 minutes south and be on a less busy beach (Playa de los Muertos) or walk 20-30 minutes south or north and be on an almost empty, wild and gorgeous tropical beach\\u2014all beautiful places with jungle backdrops, and clean sand and water. I saw about 25 different kinds of tropical birds, the trees all over town are full of green iguanas, and you can see whales from the beaches or take a tour to the Islas de las Marietas and see whales plus snorkle and watch the blue footed boobies. Then, back in town, pick from dozens of mostly inexpensive fantastic restaurants, enjoy the bars and nightlife if you wish or head home to your quiet rental if that\\u2019s what you wanted. Did I mention that the people are incredibly friendly and welcoming? And yes, there is some trash because this is a small place with a lot of folks in it, but they are mostly keeping up with it pretty well (especially compared to southeast asia if you\\u2019ve tried that).

Let me start by saying that my family and I loved this place. We stayed at a beachfront townhome at villa palmar complex and it was a 2 minute walk to the beach making it a perfect spot as I have a 2 yr old who loves the beach. The host had all the beach gear needed to hang out at the beach. Villa palmar also has a pool and a kiddo pool right in front of the beach and as you step down the stairs heading to the beach on your right you will find a beach bar called sirenitas and a massage tent. The drinks are really good and the massages run around 23 dollars for an hour. Villa palmar is gated and has security guard but all of Sayulita is very safe. It was also a 5 minute walk to Sayulita\\u2019s small town square making it ideal for a family as it\\u2019s much quieter from the night life. \\n\\nMake sure to exchange money before coming to Sayulita as restaurants/shops will give you 4 pesos less for every dollar.

Everything offered was delicious authentic Mexican food. All the staff was friendly, attentive and made sure you were well taken care off.

It\\'s about 30 mins north of Nuevo Vallarta and I gave it only 4 stars because the beach was super super crowded and the surfing was just so-so when we went. Bring booties if you surf, the rocks are cruel! The vendors walking up and down the beach selling yummy grilled shrimp skewers was pretty awesome, I had like 7 of them for 35 pesos apiece. We rented a table, chairs, and a beach mat for $200 pesos for the day and it was well worth it ... man it was hot out there! Plenty of opportunities to buy souvenirs and trinkets from an abundance of vendors so bring some effectivo (cash). Massages given right on the beach for $20 is a killer deal and you can also get the fish pedicure if that\\'s your thing. It\\'s a little tricky to navigate the narrow streets and to find parking but if you\\'re patient, I guarantee you\\'ll love it if you like rustic old beach towns.

I had read a lot about people getting sick while staying here, but whatever, never know until you do it yourself. First off it\\'s a cool little surf, tourist town. Much more active and noisy then I imagined. Our AirBB was one the road where all the traffic was being routed since the main road was closed for repairs. Also the roosters and the local birds were our alarm clock every morning at 6AM. If you love Mexican music then this is your place. Get ready to listen to it blasted well into the late night, thanks Chilly Whilly. The good. food was yummy, coffee in morning was excellent (go to the banana place), cheap beer (Negro Medelo!), weather awesome, nice beaches (Playa los Muertos!).\\nNow to the Sayilita Sickness. Out of 5 people, one being a 6 month old, only I and the baby didn\\'t get sick. Was it from the ocean? The food? The ice? I don\\'t know. I\\'m guessing probably all the above.

We were on the beach every day.  The waves are just great there because depending on which part of the beach you are they change in sizes and intensity.  You can boogie boards, surf and even swim in the waves.  If you get the right timmig with the waves it can carries you up to the shore.  I made few times both with the boogie board and free swim.  If you want to surf you can lease a board for 300 pesos for the full day. It can also be per hour.  If you are new to surf you most rental place also offer teaching lessons but the aren\\'t cheap.  We were lucky enough to meet a local who\\'s nickname is Charlie Brown (almost every locals in Sayulita know him) and he offered to teach us for 200 pesos each.  If you see him tell him you saw Hugo\\'s family review here.  He loved our daughter Valentina (he called her &quot;preciosa&quot; = precious).  Depending when you go there it can be really hot.  You can rent or buy and umbrella for 350 pesos.  Do not hesitate to deal with the vendor.  Rental goes for  150 pesos a day so it worth to buy it.  Also check the technique they use to dig it into the sand so your umbrella is planted solid.   We also used solar cream with a 60 protection and came back so dark.  Probably the darkest I was ever in any trip.  I you want to heat in Sayulita I recommend to not limit you search on trip adviser.  There is a lot of very nice restaurant that are very cheap that are not registered on trip adviser that are as good as any restaurant you could find here.  Also they would be cheaper.  Be careful with the restaurant category on trip adviser.  Most restaurant that are categorized as cheap you would pay for two: meal, small appetizer and drinks for about $60 USD tip included.  But you can find local place for half price of that.  The hiccup is that they are not necessairly on trip advisor.

He pointed to where the beach was and told us he would be back in 90 minutes.  This left most of us confused and unsure of where we could change to swim , where we should go etc.    When he picked us up, he had left the van in the sun without the A/C on and we nearly passed out from the heat before he got the van cooled down again. Then he took us to another town for lunch. We were told we could swim but the beach was so rocky you could not walk in the water without boots on!  \\n\\nBut my biggest complaint was his driving. He kept driving really fast over bumps in the road,  to the point where my head literally hit the roof of the van! He thought this was funny.

The water treatment system is grossly inadequate to handle the burgeoning population and swarms of visitors, and the consequences are evident in the fetid water pouring straight into the river mouth, polluting the river, the beach, the break, and the air. We were here for a month and were stricken with pretty severe illnesses- of the g.i. and respiratory- for half of our stay. We had already been in Mexico (Oaxaca) for 5 weeks, so our illnesses were a surprise... Until we heard from countless residents and travelers about similar ailments. We also met local surfers who no longer surf or swim at this, their home break, due to the poor water quality. This &quot;pueblo magico&quot; - a title recently bestowed by the Mexican government, is allegedly in danger of losing its status as such due to the poor water quality. If you are looking for a vibrant town with an array of nightlife and food/ drink places and you are happy to swim in your pool, this place might be for you. If, however, you are looking to swim and surf, this is not your best option. I wish the residents of Sayulita the best of luck in organizing and advocating for the apparently inept powers that be to deal with this situation.

There are literally dozens of vendors and you can sit all day long and they will bring you food drink and all kinds of local crafts to buy. We had a dozen oysters broth right to our chairs by a local vendor for only one dollar each they were large and the delicious. The restaurants bring you beer and margaritas and there is a constant stream of local vendors try to so you close truly cigars and you make sure you bargain with them. My wife bought a pair of pants for $15 that were originally $35. The beach is amazing as it is full of gold colored sand local high course content and it literally looks like you\\'re walking in Gold water. It is very shallow and safe for kids.  when you get about 100 feet there are 5 foot waves where there are surfers boogie boards and great to just body surf.

It was one hour north of Puerto Vallarta. It was great to be able to park the car, and walk everywhere.

I enjoyed the small town vibe, the international crowd of people who live there full time or half time, lots of canadians at the time. I found some nice guest homes to stay in and enjoyed spending time at the beach. My husband could walk down the beach and score grilled fish and fruit all day. At night by the town square by the church people gathered and people from other parts came down with their offerings of food. I love flan so I tried all types of flan made by local women, all delicious. It was at time noisy living downtown but it was Easter vacation so many people from inland areas came down to the beach. The vibe was super friendly and relaxed even when crowded so I can imagine it would be even more lovely at a quieter time. I want to go again. I loved the architecture and all the colors and the Huichol indian art works you could see in galleries but also buy at the beach from the artists themselves. My only complaint about the trip and Mexico in general is that they don\\'t have drinkable water, which seems ridiculous for a developing country with so much tourism dollars.. I brushed my teeth with the local water and got sick eventually.

Of course this changes with the tide!  vendors selling &quot;the usual&quot; array of handicrafts, junk, soap-bubble wands, hammocks, fruit and drinks and pastries, jewelry, etc., and etc.   We didn\\'t see any boats pulling/towing people up on the parachute/kite things -- and the reason could be that this is also a reknowned SURFING BEACH.  there is a pronounced BREAK perhaps 30 - 70-some yards offshore, which is a challenge for non-surfers to get to, and past.  however, the launches and dive/fish tour motor-boats are all parked at the south (\\'down-town&quot;) end of the beach, and can get in and out by just cutting thru the waves.\\n     if one likes to run barefoot along the coast, (again, this varies with the tide) i found that about 2/3\\'s of the way you could find a &quot;line&quot; where the sand was firm enough to make your work-out not so hard.  about 1/3 of the beach the sand was soft and i had to just buckle down and suffer (yes, just grind away, slowly but steady) through it.  exhilarating.\\n    Every day i\\'d see families on their outing, the kids staying busy and involved with the usual beach fun -- a lot of running into and away from the waves.\\n    LOTS OF DOGS.  Sayulita is one of those places where the dogs are also citizens of the town.  If you are adverse/allergic/just plain scared of dogs, well, maybe there\\'s a dog-less beach somewhere else.\\n     for the most part, the sand quality is &quot;normal&quot; -- that is, the areas of pebbles and/or a sharper-grained sand are few -- the norm is not to have to worry what your bare feet are stepping on.\\n    ONE more thing:  the beach in general is pretty well-maintained in regards BASURA.  That is, very little garbage.  I found one piece of broken glass and (of course) picked it up.

It was our 2nd visit, this time we brought friends.  It is much busier than it was 3 years ago, but maybe it had something to do with the time of year.  What I love about Sayulita is that there are no huge All-Inclusives.  Just a lot of little cute hotels and home/condo rentals.  We learned that you can definitely negotiate on price of a rental.  We had an amazing ocean view/front, (right by the ocean) house.  It was 5 bedrooms on 3 levels, amazing.  When we first contacted they asked $500/night, I said no, they said $400, I said $300, we settled on $330 a night.  Considering we were splitting the cost with another couple I thought that was pretty cheap for what we were getting.  The name of our house was Vista Del Mar.  The rental company we used was Avalos Sayulita Rentals, talk to Tamra, she is awesome!  The first night we went out we visited several restaurants just ordering appies and drinks at every place, it was awesome.  I highly recommend Calypso restaurant, it is on the 2nd level overlooking the town square.  A great breakfast and lunch place is Tierra Viva, ask for Armando, awesome guy!  My wife went to Choco Bananas every morning for her coffee, she said it was amazing and bought some beans to grind at home.  1 of the days we rented a golf cart so we could really see the town.  It was expensive $75 American/24 hours, but let\\'s just say we got our moneys worth!  We went places golf carts aren\\'t supposed to go, haha!  Funny story, that same day we were off on some trail getting aways out of town, my wife thought we were getting a little too far.  Anyways, we got to an entrance with a gate at a dead end, so to turn around I drove through the gate.  We noticed security cameras everywhere, and then the gate started to close with us in it.  My wife almost peed her pants she was so scared!  She thought we got into the compound of some drug lords, haha.  Actually, I did get a little scared when within seconds a truck starts driving our way.  Turns out we were in some private resort and they just let us out, haha!  Story to tell the grandkids one day!  The only thing I didn\\'t like was because we were 4 adults we were offered drugs a lot, just said no gracias, and walked away.\\nFor those of you who like to bring Vanilla home, you can find it in the markets for 140 pesos for a 1 litre bottle, the same bottle at the airport duty free is 240 pesos.  Taxi from the airport should be around 600 pesos into Sayulita.

If you\\'re ambitious, you can walk all the way to San Pancho, the next town north, but you have to trespass for about 100 yards to get from Playa Malpasos to the southern end of the beach of San Pancho.\\n\\nYou can walk via dirt road to Playa Los Muertos which is a very beautiful and less populated beach with an interesting walk through the cemetery.  That sounds creepy and morbid but it really isn\\'t;  it\\'s touching to see all the flowers and candles left for loved ones who\\'ve passed.\\n\\nGo for the long walk to Playa Carricitos which is the most beautiful beach I personally have ever seen, including a load of beaches on all of the Hawaiian islands.  There are cool rock formations to scramble around on, on both ends of the beach.  Looking south you can see all the way to Punta de Mita.

For our kids it was a new experience to see street vendors come in the bus to sell water, snacks and soda, and in one stop we even got to pick up a guitar player who serenaded us for part of the trip!

We have just completed a wonderful week in Sayulita...we traveled for Christmas with our adult children, their spouses and our two toddler grandchildren. Sayulita was the perfect choice. It\\'s easy to get there after a flight into Puerto Vallarta. We had arranged a VRBO in Los Delfines complex in the north part of this sweet little town, right on the beach. We arranged transport from the airport ahead of time as a car is really unnecessary. We rented golf carts to get around which were the perfect form of transportation and great entertainment for the toddlers. \\n\\nOur transport stopped at MEGA the superstore just north of the airport so we could stock up for the week...it\\'s a great place to get everything and anything.  While you can buy anything you need in Sayulita getting diapers, beverages, and enough food for the first few days worked out well. \\n\\nSayulita is a very family friendly place so eating out with the kids was a breeze and very inexpensive. Kid\\'s menus everywhere always included a yummy fruit smoothie along with the main dish (quesadilla w beans and rice, chicken pieces with papas fritas, bean and cheese burrito). And then there were the tacos...tacos...and more amazing tacos. Eat at the local carts..they are cheap, clean and incredible. We did taco take out on more than one occasion.  \\n\\nThe beach near town gets pretty crowded. We loved put beach at the north end...quiet, fewer waves and a short walk to get paddle boards or a massage. If surfing is your things, you\\'ll need to walk down to the beach closer to town where the waves are best. \\n\\nChristmas week was great. Perfect weather, a hint here and there of the holiday, warm water and the wonderful easy going people of Sayulita wh were so welcoming to all those of us who has flocked south to avoid the snow. Be aware that many of the restaurants are close don Christmas Eve evening and Christmas Day. There are still plenty of choices but the beach bars are almost all closed Christmas Day. Stock up and enjoy the day on the beach. Don\\'t worry...oxxo market ( think seven eleven) is still open as are th fish and vegetable market ( get there before noon) if you don\\'t plan ahead. Also, all the ATMs in town were out of cash by noon Christmas Eve. Stock up the day before or really stock up on pesos at one of the banks connected to MEGA before you get to Sayulita. Everyone takes dollars but the exchange rate isn\\'t great. While most bogged restaurants take credit cards the beach bars, carts ( really don\\'t miss these) and smaller restaurants and shops do not. \\n\\nMost of all....enjoy!!

Traditional Mexican streets shops and plaza right out of the movies with all the lights and banners strung across the streets. Cute cute cute. We soon found the beach which was filled with surfing activities and of course the typical vendors one expects in this region. However.... we found all these massage vendors set up with open tents and palapas offering good value massages. If you want to go down to the birthday suit ....here you need to be pretty open minded as privacy is not an option in the tents we found. Level of dress is up to the customer as these talented Mexican ladies didn\\'t mind either way. We negotiated for 1.5 hour deep tissue massages. Both our ladies had strong hands and very talented technique. I had a fabulous massage. I have a back problem due to a car accident this year and my massage lady found all my problem spots almost instantly. For a third the price of a resort treatment.

And, the food that some of these vendors offer is really good.  \\nYou can rent a space on the beach, with your own little palapa, table and beach chairs.  These are available in several areas along the main stretch of beach.  And, several beachside eating/drinking establishments provide beachside seating while consuming your purchase.  \\nThe beach isn\\'t &quot;beautiful&quot;, by some beach standards.  A few of the beachside establishments make an effort to keep their areas litter free, but that\\'s not the case along the entire beach.  \\nMexicans love dogs, but unfortunately that has led to an uncontrolled number of them and many are &quot;homeless&quot; and hang out on the beach.  They are always looking for a handout or scraps of food that were dropped or disposed of.  A lot of these dogs are well cared for, but many are not and they are gaunt and sickly looking.  I believe Sayulita has been making an effort to control this situation.  \\nSayulita has changed dramatically, from my first visit over 15 years ago.  More and more people have made Sayulita their home, and more and more businesses have opened.  It\\'s still a small fishing town, but it\\'s not the &quot;sleepy little Mexican hideaway&quot; I first visited.  It continues to draw surfers, and there are opportunities for lessons at several locations along the beach.  If you are in Puerto Vallarta, it\\'s only about a.$4, round trip, on the bus to get to/from Sayulita.  It\\'s a great day trip.  .

It\\'s basically, from my point of view, the real MIDDLEGROUND between the two.\\nYou can easily find a bar open at night for a couple of drinks and live music, and you can also go to the beach and relax quietly on the sand.\\nIt has a somewhat large national &amp; international tourist base year-round, so you can count on meeting people from all over the world whenever you visit.\\nIv\\'ve been there a couple of times, on different seasons and although there\\'s a noticeable decrease in tourists on &quot;low-season&quot; , theres always people around and businesses stay open year-round.\\nSo, no matter when you visit, you\\'ll be guaranteed a good time, good food, good drinks, good company and a lot of nice, traditional places to enjoy and visit.\\nHowever, if I\\'m being honest, I really wasn\\'t a fan of the beach itself...\\nThe water-temp, the view and the sound are all amazing, it\\'s a beach after all!\\nBut, inevitably I compared it with my beloved San Pancho, and the results weren\\'t that flattering for Sayulita...\\nThe water, to my eyes, wasn\\'t as clear and as turquoise as San Pancho\\'s, and when going into the water, there are some rocks that make the walk a bit uncomfortable, and that was a definite turn off.

But the one on the shore is a darkish-black muddy color that isn\\'t very appealing.\\nBut I found that the farthest I walked from the &quot;main beach&quot;, the clearer the sand got, and the prettier it looked.\\n\\nSo my advice is, if you\\'re looking for a relaxing time enjoying the beach, walk a little longer and find a better spot. If you\\'re looking to meet new people, looking for conversation and people overall, stay on the main beach and you\\'ll love it.\\n\\nOverall, a really nice experience, loved the shops (a lot of places that have amazing locally produced stuff that wiped me out), the food (there are lots of options for any kind of taste) and the people (both locals and toursits are always friendly and super helpful).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Sayulita Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/c5/24/8c/sayulita.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Sayulita", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "301160346": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "The waves!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g445056-d6467604-Reviews-Sayulita_Beach-Sayulita_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/c5/24/8c/sayulita.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The waves were nice here! make sure to were sandals as its really hot!.

Once you arrive into the town you realize what special charm exist in this place. There is a mixture of Southern California surfer beach town vibe mixed with mexican village charm and accented with European bohemian style. This is a surfer, artist town with a very laid back feel. Plenty of good food, nice bars and lots of art stores. The beach and the jungle around it are spectacular and very few placed offer this much beauty and serenity along with a sense that this place can turn up the party at night.

If you are looking for an authentic experience and would like to immerse yourself in Mexican culture and really experience Mexico, (instead of living on the resort bubble), this is the place to visit. There are some hostels/hotels and not many large resorts in the area. However, there are a ton of rental properties to choose from and in my opinion this is the best way to experience Sayulita. My boyfriend and three of our friends rented a house on the hill, with pool, two bedrooms, three bath, open roof tarrace with ocean view and nice ammenities. Price worked out to be about $130/person/night. However, you can get less lavish and smaller places for much less as well. I recommend checking out the website &quot;Sayulita Life&quot; for condo and house rentals they have a lot of properties to choose from. \\n\\nSafety: Compared to many other places I have visited in Latin America, Sayulita is VERY safe. No sketchy vibes, no gangster looking people walking around, just a really friendly and nice place, surfer style. \\n\\nFood: There are lots of cool places to eat in Sayulita. If you are looking for McDonalds and Starbucks you will be disappointed, its mostly authentic and local restaurants - no big American chains. That being said, Sayulita is a great place to experience authentic Mexican food - from street food, to casual cafe\\'s and restaurants to fancy places. My personal fav for lunch, happy hour, and casual dinners is &quot;Aloha&quot;, located just up from the very end of the beach. This hidden gem has some of the best ceviche and fish tacos I have ever had and the owner is really friendly. Located literally steps from the beach it is an awesome place to eat after catching some waves and meet the local crowd.\\n\\nSurfing: Best surfing school located at the very end of the beach is Tigre surf school. Awesome guys fun to hang out with. \\n\\nOverall, Sayulita and Saylita Beach are awesome, great culture, lots to do, awesome surfing and good times.

For those who don\\'t mind walking and do not care for chair rentals or sports equipment rentals, there\\'s a another beach far left of the river mouth, past the cemetery.

The water treatment plant doesn\\'t work well and basically we got sick from unclean water being dumped back into the ocean. The treatment plant is in the middle of town right on the river that separates north from south. It smelled terrible and we would get wiffs of it while walking through town. The bothersome thing is that the locals know that you can get sick when swimming in the bay but they don\\'t tell you that BEFORE you go. One hotel manager at the Kupuri told us oh ya - I had some friends here when people were getting sick from swimming in the bay so they just swam a Los Muertos (another close by beach). There were 4 other people who stayed at our hotel the previous week we were there and the doctor said they had gotten sick from swimming in the bay. I believe this is negligent on the people in charge of running the town. If you look at the roads in town there is a pharmacy every other door - this should tell us alone that this is a town to go to where lots of people get sick. Boo Sayulita!

The towing guy was quick to acknowledge (once he figured out I speak Spanish) we had not violated any ordinance, but apparently we were inconvenient to a business.  By the time we got to our car (parked across the river because there was no parking anywhere near our hotel), the car was on the flatbed, and it took $50 to get him to release it.  Just a shake-down.  As generously as we had tipped every place we actually visited, this left a profoundly sour taste in our mouths.  It holds some charm for folks who love the beachy, sandy communities, but just beware.  You get no credit for being friendly or generous. I am told the bus from Vallarta is convenient and cheap, ao that might be the way to go.  But the ease with which these folks took us for granted made me want to avoid it in the future.

The clothing stores tend to be pricey so look on the beach before you head into town to buy a new dress or ???

Be prepared to dive two or three crashes before you get out past the breaking waves - then you have to get back in!!

Beach chairs and umbrellas front the main beach accesses from the town.  Locals set up their own vending stations.  The OXXO store is a good place to buy your drugs, and I don\\'t mean pharmacia - ( We were approached 4 times in 2 weeks to purchase drugs from a back pack) \\nThere are a couple of bathrooms facilities along the beach -  some cared for by locals who charge 5 pesos or so for using them.\\nThis beach gets a lot of dogs out for their daily excercise, especially Sunday when everyone brings their dog (s).  It is fun to watch, but saw only one guy in two weeks actually pick up his dog\\'s feces.\\nThank fully the tidal surf washes it all away every night, so the beach stays fairly clean.  Also be prepared to not have a moment\\'s rest.  Obviously, there has to be an ecomony for the locals, but the vending up and down the beach gets tiresome after a while.

I usually go once a year so this year I thought I would write a review. We took the buses from Punta Negra to Downtown P.V. to Sayulitas for a day trip since it has been cloudy this week. Since the surf has been high, the opportunity to see surfers in action prompted me to take this trip. Fyi. in 2015 the bus from Mismaloya is 8pesos, the city buses are 7.5p, and the bus from Ave Las Palmas Walmart to Sayulita\\'s is 35p. The fare to Sayulitas drops as you get closer I hear.  Anyway, the bus we rode on was more comfortable than the city buses. Cushy seats and music ! :). We went on a Friday so as we walked toward &quot;downtown&quot; Sayulita\\'s from where the bus &quot;terminal&quot; is, there was a &quot;farmers/flea&quot; type market going on that morning. Since we had arrived late morning, early lunch time, we had lunch at the RiverCafe and then walked around town where the wives shopped and the guys headed towards the beach to watch the surfing action. The waves didn\\'t disappoint and neither did the shopping and surfing. As a baby boomer in my late 60\\'s I surfed the east coast beaches until I enlisted and went on the Southeast Asian Tour. Sayulita\\'s reminds me of what the surfing life was in the 60\\'s in Calif and N.Y., N.J. shore towns. Young people with surf boards and the beach was the focus during the day.\\nThe youthful atmosphere includes the colorful buildings, the young surfer carving the waves, and now the paddle boarders joining in with the occasional bogey boarder. It was fun watching the surfers while our wives visited every shop or bought from the beach vendors that smelled the &quot;open to buy&quot; vibe our wives emitted. You can rent a chair, you can rent a surf, paddle or bogey board. My only compliant is that they charge by the day not hour ! So it is 200p or nothing. Like any beach town there is an occasional riff raft working the beach but it is not the Mexican vendors. A young youth tried to sell me a box of cigars he &quot;found&quot; . Our wives got some great deals on the beach vs the shops on necklaces. My wife got a great deal on a purse in a shop vs a vendor so as you can see, the shopping is everywhere. The surf school youth were very helpful and you can take in a surfing lesson if you wish. I recommend bringing a mat, towel and beach chair to enjoy the beach. The beach is public but not the chairs !  I also recommend bottle water and stay away from where the river flows into the ocean if it has recently rained (dirtier water). Like the title says: &quot;To be young again&quot;  because if I was in my teens-30\\'s, I would relive an &quot;Endless Summer&quot; experience here, alternating with downtown P.V. living. OH one last thing you have to eat a CHOCO BANANA ! You know the concept is good when imitators pop up. A local legend that has grown into a casual restaurant but you can still order from the take out booth, sit on the improved local plaza ringed with restaurants. If you are look)ing for a beach front restaurant, the most elegant is (Don Pablo\\'s? or Don Pancho\\'s?) which has a bar and tables inside and outside on the left side of the beach as you look at it. Enjoy the day or Stay regardless it is a different vibe than other parts of Puerto Vallarta/ Navarit Area.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Sayulita Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/c5/24/8c/sayulita.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Sayulita", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "253993728": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Quint town", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g445056-d6467604-Reviews-Sayulita_Beach-Sayulita_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/c5/24/8c/sayulita.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "we took a taxi from our hotel to this town.

Quite a lot of Galleries offering local textiles, pottery, jewelry, art. Wasn\\'t impressed with the Wall art. Everything else in the galleries was of high standard and thus reflected in the price. Many, many places of Accommodation, but they are not gaudy and in your face. One really has to look for them. Super fresh produce on the sidewalks. Found wonderful big round, weighty Passionfruit that had just the right aroma coming from them. Cut 2 in half and each shared our half right on the main street, slurping the pulp our with our tongues. Bit messy, but delicious. I bought a wonderful silver ring from a young jeweller, who has his own store. He melts silver dollars, so the quality of silver is higher than the 95. The ring is set with Mexican Fire Opals. I have had so many comments on it within a week of coming home. I recommend spending a few days in Sayulita to truly take time to explore. There are many villas and homes that would suit large groups, which would cut down costs. We took a Taxi back that day. We did arrive safely at our Resort after 3/4 hr of crazy 40k over the speed limit, tail gating, passing 3 cars on a double solid line with oncoming traffic; our driver blasting his horn so the oncoming traffic went for the side. all the time he strummed with his right hand to the beat of &quot;Grease&quot; songs - the main one being &quot;Staying Alive&quot;.

Every day at around 6pm the &quot;campamento tortuguero&quot; releases newborn turtles into the sea. One day it is 50 and others it can be hundreds ( one day it was 820). This is great for anyone but especially for the kids as they are allowed to hold and release them. Also very educational. It is a beautiful walk on the beach towards the north. Very clean.

It was a wonderful combination day of beach and shops!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Sayulita Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/c5/24/8c/sayulita.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Sayulita", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "201718101": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Surf beach", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g445056-d6467604-Reviews-Sayulita_Beach-Sayulita_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/c5/24/8c/sayulita.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "My wife and I took a day trip to Sayulita beach while on our yearly vacation to Puerto Vallarta.
