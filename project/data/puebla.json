This might have been the best zoo I\\'ve ever been to. We didn\\'t come to Mexico for the zoo, but we\\'re glad we checked this out. We got tickets from the office in the NW corner of the Zocalo (one weird issue: they only take cash at this ticket office; they\\'re happy to take your tarjeta de credito at the park), and ended up having the van to ourselves. The driver was nervous that we didn\\'t speak much Spanish, but was friendly and spoke slowly and I was able to understand 90% of it with my rudimentary language skills. The van took us through the safari park, driving us so close to the animals that we could almost touch them. All the animals seemed well cared for. Then we had a few hours to get lunch (decent pizza) and do a walking part of the zoo, which was also well done, followed by a fun bird show. Highly recommended.

(I called ahead because of my ability to speak Spanish fluently, but it\\u2019s up to you!) An experience is 1,500 pesos (75 USD) per person but includes a private guide, safari hat &amp; water bottle, entrance to the park, ANDDDDD feeding giraffes. You can do the experience in English or Spanish, and there are options such as feeding lemurs or rhinos too. We did it in English, and our guide Checo was incredible. He took about 50 pictures of us feeding the giraffes so we have incredible photos forever. We fed the giraffe for about 20-30 minutes on a private Jeep, where we could ask questions and just enjoy the awesome experience. Then we did a mini tour with elephants, zebras, and more with Checo. We went into this tunnel and were a couple FEET away from elephants. Checo was incredible. \\n\\nAfter that, the safari is in two parts: walking &amp; safari bus. We walked around and saw birds, Jaguars, kangaroos, and more. Then, we did the bus safari tour with Cristian, who was excellent. \\n\\nHowever, we missed the 3pm tour and one of the park workers drove us in a separate Jeep to catch up with them. \\n\\nOverall, an incredible experience!!!

First of all, I took a &quot;tourist bus&quot; and it was absolutely awful. I am not 100% sure, but it appears that the Puebla Bureau of Tourism contracts out these buses. The driver of my bus refused to use the air-conditioning and the windows did not open. Thus the trip there and back was in sweltering heat. Also, whichever side of the bus you sit on, it is a guarantee that the people on the other side will thoughtlessly stand, effectively blocking your view. I am not even positive that the animals are truly wild since the staff walked among them, seemingly unworried about being trampled or mauled by &quot;wild&quot; animals. So, in my opinion if you go, do so in a private vehicle where you can see from both sides of the car or van.

We paid for an experience you get three choices- To feed Lemurs, To feed Giraffes, or To feed a Rhino. We picked the rhino and were not disappointed. First, you get to hop on a VIP jeep that can hold 9-12 adults. You are taken to a special area where you are asked to wash hands but then we were given silk bandanas. After that, you are taken to the enclosure and you get to feed the rhino. The entire time you are given so much information from the guides and they take pictures the whole time. In the end, you are brought back to the VIP area, asked to wash your hands again, and given a water bottle with USB of the best photos and videos taken. \\n\\nThe safari was amazing and all the animals were so close.

Don\\'t pre-purchase your tickets buying them there makes for a lot less confusion. \\n2.) The experiences are pricey but worth it!\\n3.) Bring a Cooler full of drinks, snacks, and even lunch if you want. You are in the car almost 90% of the time and a cooler fool of goodies would have been amazing. There are plenty of stops to grab some snacks and drinks just would be nice to have the cooler\\n4.) Take your time. You get to go at your pace and almost everywhere is two lanes so if some people are impatient to let them pass enjoy yourself. \\n5.) At the end, there is an adventure park budget 100-200 pesos for.

Sure, it\\'s a zoo, it\\'s enclosures but I felt really comfortable with everything there and the staff all clearly care about their wards.\\n\\nI would consider it a \\'must do\\' in Puebla - even though it\\'s probably not at the top of the radar, if you love animals, put it there.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Africam Safari", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/13/72/1a/fe/jirafas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Boulevard Carlos Camacho Espiritu Km 16.5", "addressLocality": "Puebla", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "72960", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "274531217": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Outstanding Animal Park - Worth the Drive from D.F.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152773-d2538696-Reviews-Africam_Safari-Puebla_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/13/72/1a/fe/jirafas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I did not know what to expect from this place, but friends wanted to visit.

This place is absolutely UNBELIEVABLE!!! I was truly amazed!!! the variety of animals is astonishing! The proximity to which you can approach with the car is really MAGICAL! We saw FIVE bears within just a few feet from our car! it was such a glorious treat!!! But like the bears we saw so many others.  My favorites were probably the giraffes with a new little one posing for the pictures, or so I thought! After we thought it was all done, we discovered a WHOLE new area by foot with hundreds of other animals these more in like a zoo like setting but quite espectacular as well.  \\n\\nthe attraction is so well set up and as I passed by one amazing animal after the other I kept wondering how they were able to keep the place so nice when the attraction itself was so cheap - less than $20 US dollars per head. (you pay per head and not per car 232 pesos per adults and 225 for kids)  We even got to ride on a canoe as they have a water reservoir adjacent to the park which is the largest in puebla.  This ride too was very cheap at less than 20 dollars PER CANOE!!! (200 pesos per canoe which fits 6).  \\n\\nThis was an amazing adventure and I can\\'t wait to take other friends there!  if you are considering going, consider no more and rush there as the weather now is absolutely great but I am told it gets hot in the summer and very crowded.

We went there on a Tuesday morning and the circuit was basically empty. There were maybe five other cars doing the round. We saw the most important animals you would see on a safari: lions, rhinos, elephants (although Asian and not African), water buffalos. But also giraffes, zebras, hippos, crocodiles, tigers, bears, and much, much more.\\n\\nThe most amazing thing was how close to the animals we got, something you cannot get in a zoo. At one point we were face to face with a rhinoceros which was a bit intimidating, but a caretaker walked this huge animal out of the road and we continued our amazing adventure.\\n\\nI found the park to be extremely well kept, the scenery breathtaking, and the animals to be very well taken care of. They are not in caged and just roam around the property in their own section. The tigers were in a smaller space but had plenty of place to move around. Nearly all animals are in groups.\\n\\nAfter the &quot;drive-thru&quot; you can park the car and explore more in a zoo type setting. The kids had a lot of fun with the kangaroos. There is just so much to do and you should plan at least 3-4 hours if you include a lunch break. \\n\\nWe ate at the Kilimanjaro caf\\u00e9 for lunch. Food was average, portions were rather on the small side but pricing was okay, they even have Wi-Fi. There are public bathrooms throughout the property and these are pretty clean.\\n\\nVisiting during the week meant that there were barely people on the circuit but also that some attractions or snack bars were closed. However, these attractions were not animal related but rather items like toboggans and the like (which were also at additional cost) so not a big deal.\\n\\nIf was a fantastic experience for the kids (9 and 11) who liked this outing the best. We have been in the Mexico City/Puebla region for 10 days and Africam Safari was their favorite thing to do followed by the pyramids of Teotihuacan, the city of Puebla, the site of Cholula, and finally the town of Tecali with their onyx and marble shops. \\n\\nSo even if Africam Safari is not the first thing that comes to mind when visiting Mexican heritage and this amazing region, it is a good change for young children who might appreciate a break from ancient ruins and old churches regardless of how much they are in awe of this culture.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Africam Safari", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/13/72/1a/fe/jirafas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Boulevard Carlos Camacho Espiritu Km 16.5", "addressLocality": "Puebla", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "72960", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "160475332": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Unique experience with the Family", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152773-d2538696-Reviews-Africam_Safari-Puebla_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/13/72/1a/fe/jirafas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Hello, we have been visiting Africam Safari for a long time.

When you finish the tour, go to the place where they have the kangaroos, it is great, you can touch them and be literally inside their cage!!.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Africam Safari", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/13/72/1a/fe/jirafas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Boulevard Carlos Camacho Espiritu Km 16.5", "addressLocality": "Puebla", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "72960", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "153812723": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Fun Place to Spend the Day", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152773-d2538696-Reviews-Africam_Safari-Puebla_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/13/72/1a/fe/jirafas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is not San Diego Wild Animal Park - don\\'t expect that level of attention to the habitat.

I had LOVED the sound of it - it sounded huge, like the animals had so much space to roam in natural habitats, with other animals.  The reality of it is, it is a drive-thru zoo, and not a good one either.  There are a few different climates themed, but they were missing much-needed vegetation.  They were only 1 or 2 or 3 of each different type of large african animal, not nearly enough for social herd animals to live happily or behave naturally.  There were few or no small animals, which are just as important to ecosystems, and just as interesting.  Information about the animals was limited to &quot;African Elephant&quot;, &quot;Zebra&quot;, &quot;Giraffe&quot;.  Nothing about their native range size, migration habits, behaviours.  All the animals looked SO SAD!  I felt horrible knowing I had given money to a business which was clearly neglecting and exploiting these poor creatures!\\n\\nPlease, please don\\'t come here, and don\\'t bring children here.

Too bad the planning and management of such attraction, no other thing that a big Ferris Wheel, has a lot to improve. On three different times I have attempted to ride the wheel.  The first year, over 2 years ago, upon our arrival we were told the wheel was not functioning because of maintenance issues, the second year the same.  This month, a friend drove all the way from Veracruz to meet with me in Puebla, I live in North East USA.  My friend took her granddaughter for the only purpose she could ride the wheel.  In the Tourist Information Office, Downtown Puebla,  we verified that the wheel was in operation, as it is advertised in the Travel brochure issued by Secretaria de Turismo,  we were assured it was, Saturdays and Sundays 11 am till 9.30 PM.  The following day, December 13,  after 11 AM,  we took a cab to ride the F-Wheel.  Several workers, over 10  were there, we asked at what time would they wheel be functioning,  were informed that the F-Wheel was not in operation because of maintenance.  We asked how long the maintenance issue would take place, we were told it could be an hour or more. We waited an hour, were back to the same group of workers, who were doing nothing but chatting, we asked whether they knew when the issue would be resolved or whether the following day SUNDAY, would be in operation, they did not know, they could not give us a website or a phone number to check out whether the wheel would function . From my observation and talking to other people around,  I think there were not mechanical issues with the F-Wheel,  only POOR Management. It would be better to inform the public the Star of Puebla only shines week-ends at night ( maybe), or at least have a phone number or website where you can verify, before you go,  whether it is operation or not.  The workers told us....IF YOU SEE THE WHEEL MOVING, THEN IT IS WORKING...it is hard from Downtown Puebla to see whether the F-Wheel is moving or not. Unless you can verify it is working before you go I would not recommend to go unless you want to visit the Shopping Mall, and for me a Shopping Mall is another Shopping Mall as many others around the world.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "1"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Estrella de Puebla", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/9b/5b/c4/una-atraccion-increible.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Osa Mayor 2520", "addressLocality": "Puebla", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "72190", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "328593881": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Fantastic view of the complete City", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152773-d4701262-Reviews-Estrella_de_Puebla-Puebla_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/9b/5b/c4/una-atraccion-increible.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This place is a nice opportunity to see the complete City view and to realize how large is Puebla, the access is very quick and the fare is very affordable.

We were literally accosted by a museum employee who insisted very aggressively and rudely that we leave immediately, and go through the museum in order. He told us we couldn\\'t come back until we understood a little about the baroque period. As a university professor I found this assumption offensive, but it was his demeanor that was the most offensive. Nonetheless, in an effort to be agreeable, we began to walk out of that section to try to go through rooms 1-6. The nasty employee then called ahead to a colleague on his walkie-talkie to make sure we left his section. This man accosted us and literally escorted us out. \\nAfter that terrible experience we should have left, but we wanted to give the place a chance and dutifully completed rooms 1-8. We then decided to try the highly reviewed restaurant. Then things went from bad to worse. The restaurant, like the museum, was beautiful but empty. We ordered two meals and a bottle of wine. As is customary in fine restaurants in Mexico, the waiter poured the wine and we did not have access to the bottle. When we were finished and asked for the check we were charged for a bottle of wine and three glasses. We politely asked why and reminded the waiter that we had ordered a bottle. In fact, the wine we were drinking was not even on the menu by the glass. That was when the trouble began. Not only did the waiter try to fight with us over this, his captain did as well. Their rudeness was part and parcel of the whole nasty experience at this museum.

We recently went with a friend to visit the new Museo Internacional del Barroco that has opened on the outskirts of this wonderful colonial city.  My wife is a professor who has studied colonial art and literature, and she sets a high standard for anything having to do with the Baroque period.  She was not disappointed in this new museum.  They have correctly hired an outstanding Japanese architect, Toyo Ito, who has designed  stunning post-modern building that evokes but does not imitate the curves of Baroque art and architecture.  The museography is outstanding.  The permanent collection is well displayed, and very instructive, and the opening temporary exhibit that opens the museum, which will close June 15, is on the &quot;Nao de China&quot;, entitled Return Voyage -- The China Galleon and the Baroque in Mexico, 1565-1815, dealing with the fascinating exchange of trade in art, objects, ideas, etc., that took place during the Spanish colonial period.  If this exhibit is emblematic of what the Museo Internacional del Barroco will produce in the future, I am sure we will return many times.  The Museum, supported by the state government, is very well staffed.  There is a lovely restaurant, though we only had coffee there, and hope to dine sometime.  We noticed some student groups, young children as well as teenagers, and they seemed very taken with the museum.

If this is one of your first stops in Mexico, prepare to be amazed by the gold that heavenly adorns this side chapel! Colonial Mexico art and architecture truly produced some of the greatest works in the history of the world!\\n\\nFor tourists running on a strict schedule, make sure you check out this church and chapel well before or after a mass is scheduled, as the gates to the chapel are closed and you should vacate the sanctuary area when mass is in session. During my first group study abroad trip to Puebla, we arrived to the church of Santo Domingo about 10 minutes before a scheduled mass, so we only were able to briefly see parts of the chapel from the closed gates. The next year, thankfully, we arrived a little bit early. I\\'m not sure if the chapel gates are open throughout the day and only closed for mass, but it seemed like it was only open for limited slots of time before the gates were closed again. We had to gather at the closed gates before a staff person opened the gates, allowed the chapel to fill to capacity, and proceeded to give us a full tour albeit without a microphone or loud voice. Try researching the history of this magnificent chapel before visiting, as it will only enhance your experience. Regardless, enjoy the real-deal gold decorations, and take a moment to send up a prayer! iAmo Puebla!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Rosary Chapel (Capilla del Rosario)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/ad/00/f3/rosary-chapel-capilla.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Santo Domingo Church", "addressLocality": "Puebla", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "72000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "468304811": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Amazing !!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152773-d156071-Reviews-Rosary_Chapel_Capilla_del_Rosario-Puebla_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/ad/00/f3/rosary-chapel-capilla.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Amazing chapel, 8th wonder of the world, the gold and details, the love for God and worship at this history chapel is amazing", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Rosary Chapel (Capilla del Rosario)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/ad/00/f3/rosary-chapel-capilla.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Santo Domingo Church", "addressLocality": "Puebla", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "72000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "467936185": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Awe inspiring.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152773-d156071-Reviews-Rosary_Chapel_Capilla_del_Rosario-Puebla_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/ad/00/f3/rosary-chapel-capilla.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We walked by this church on a Sunday afternoon, just before 2pm.

Description pales; there is really no way to put in words the amazing workmanship and the sheer quantity of gold leaf covering the walls and high vaulted ceiling.  It\\'s even difficult to take pictures of the Chapel, as the light that reflects off every gilt surface confounds eye and light sensor alike.

The lighting at night is something to be seen and enjoyed either walking around the park or simply sitting on a bench and watching the world go by. The Cathedral lit up at night is not to be missed if you like Colonial architecture.\\n\\nThe streets are very clean and not overly crowded  and I felt very safe at all times, day or night. Restaurants are many and varied with some very tasty food for quite reasonable prices.  A bargain of a City! Enough to do both inside the City and the surrounding area to keep you busy for 3-4 days easily. And an added bonus for us was that there didn\\'t seem to be a lot of &quot;Norte Americanos&quot;  wandering around which tells me that this city is still somewhat undiscovered, which is so much the better.\\n\\nEven though we have been traveling in Mexico for the past 20+ years, this was our first trip to Puebla, but it won\\'t be our last!

However, only a few dollars any other day its open. \\n\\nThe museum has several different types of exhibit including a contemporary modern art section, a photographic section - black and whites taken in the 60\\'s of Mexico City and surrounds, although not sure if this was a temporary exhibit and furniture, paintings and such like set out in rooms of one of the houses of the museum. However, we visited particularly for the mexican artifacts and we were not disappointed. Some amazing pieces here some of which look as if they were made a few years ago rather than hundreds, they are in such good condition.Shame there wasn\\'t more explanation in English but it didn\\'t matter too much. Definitely worth a visit as it is rare to find ancient sculptures and pottery of this type in such fantastic condition.\\n\\nThe museum building is also beautiful set in two historic houses with lovely courtyards and there is a good cafe on the top floor.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Amparo Museum (Museo Amparo)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/14/b1/e2/58/centro-historico.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle 2 sur 708", "addressLocality": "Puebla", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "72000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "649738501": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Enlightening ", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152773-d153773-Reviews-Amparo_Museum_Museo_Amparo-Puebla_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/14/b1/e2/58/centro-historico.jpg", "datePublished": "February 2, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Interesting .

The museum is full of Mexican history with exhibits featuring pre-columbian artifacts including Mayan, Olmec, and Aztec.  The building is walking distance from the Zocalo.

I had heard so much about the Barroco museum and was urged to go there by friends. No one mentioned Museo Amparo and frankly, this museum was a lot better.\\n\\nI\\'ll start off with the terrace, don\\'t miss it. You can easily spend an hour up there sipping on tea or coffee as you read a book or look at the city skyline with dozens of cupolas rising into the sky. There\\'s a coffee shop up there as well. This terrace is beautifully designed with seating, walking areas and greens. \\n\\nThe museum itself is separated into three floors with a permanent collection of Pre-Hispanic art on the ground floor. The works on display are beautiful and very well kept. These are works of arts I remember reading and seeing in history books growing up in Mexico and to see them live was surreal. The collection is very extensive so give yourself plenty of time to see each artifact and read about. \\n\\nthere are also works of photography and books on display on the other two floors. Some displays are permanent while others are temporary but judging from the temporary exhibits I saw this museum goes all out when acquiring and putting art on display. \\n\\nThe building itself has a colonial facade but once you walk inside you\\'ll be pleasantly surprised by how modern this museum is. The lobby itself is breathtaking. There was no money spared when they built this museum and I\\'m glad they saved the facade to make it fit the historic neighborhood. The museum itself is housed in what used to be two building, a hospital and a private home.\\n\\nThis hotel has been around for 25 years and frankly it doesn\\'t get the attention it deserves. I highly recommend a visit to this museum. Photography is allowed but  backpacks must be stored in their locker room.\\n\\nI was really surprised by the use of technology at this museum. Again, they didn\\'t spare expenses. The way they incorporate technology to further the experience and to learn more about the art on display is excellent.\\n\\nThere is also a gift shop, restaurant and library on site. \\n\\nThe museum is closed Tuesdays.

Fluid design, well framed displays and the right kind of light for flashless photography makes for an informative and entertaining experience throughout. In my view, one needs at least a full day to truly appreciate its collections. Be sure to watch the video that shows an interview with an indigenous woman in her native tongue. It is a testament to the variety of Indigenous languages still spoken in Mexico and provides the historical continuity with the collections. In terms of logistics, their entrance fee for foreigners is ridiculously low compared to other museums of similar standing worldwide. They are strict about the no liquids rule past the reception area, so be sure to leave your large purses or other large objects at the front desk.

I have difficulty with the merit and what seems to be lack of effort that goes into what is called art in this gallery. There were, in my estimation, a multitude of similar disappointing examples. The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis MN, which I really enjoy,  made, what I thought, a lack luster contribution. All said, you cannot beat the view from the roof of the gallery.

It inncluded artifacts from Tolteca, Totonaca, Nayarit, Azteca, Maya, Huasteca, Olmec, and other civilizations.  The museum was clean and very well maintained.

Visiting the museum was our favorite stop in Puebla!  \\n\\nThe only thing which was slightly annoying was that if you wanted to take photos, you had to pay an extra 50 pesos (~$5).

It occupies a long vaulted hall with a splendid altarpiece from the mid 14th century gracing the far end. The altarpiece is covered with gold leaf, and the center is dominated by a painting of the Madonna of Trapani by Sicilian master Nino Pisano. \\n\\nThe library has been recognized for its antiquity, originality and artistic value: in 1981, the Mexican government declared it a historic monument and in 2005, UNESCO added it to the Memory of the World list.

It runs for a couple of miles. Unluckily we did not have the time to walk it all. Any serious tourist in the area should take the time to visit them. Besides, they are on the way to Xalapa 10 minutes from the highway.\\nThe best / worst thing is that they are unknown so there are no visitors even on the weekends.

Perote was settled by farmers from Spain and they are are famous for the smoked meats.  At the restaurant we had remarkable spanish tortillas of egg and potatoes with Jamon Serrano.

So if you\\'re not fit you\\'ll need to take your time going up &amp; down the many many large steps on the site\\n\\n- take plenty of water and a hat, as the site\\'s altitude &amp; wind means the sun is deceptively strong and the air very dry &amp; thin; there\\'s little shade onsite too\\n\\n- take your own food, as there even though there is a museum at the site entrance, there is no cafe or even vending machines and no shops until Tepeyahualco, the nearest village, 8km away (and not IMHO walkable).\\n\\n- public transport options are not for the fainthearted, esp solo female travellers!  If there are more than 2 or 3 of you I\\'d seriously suggest you look into hiring a car for the day, as it\\'s much quicker and less stressful - it took me 3h 45mins each way by public transport, and I didn\\'t wait a long time in Oriental for connections either way.  I really don\\'t understand why there are direct bus services running from Puebla to Cantona!\\n\\nHere\\'s my advice on how to get to Cantona from Puebla by public transport.  Please don\\'t let this put you off!  It\\'s just I hope if my experience can make anyone\\'s else\\'s a little easier, all the better! :-  \\n\\n1) take a bus to Oriental run by \\'Via\\' bus company from the CAPU bus station in NW Puebla.  I took a taxi from where I was staying near Zocalo which cost 60 pesos and took 20 mins (although note it wasn\\'t in rush hour).  I\\'m sure there are buses running to CAPU too, but no-one at the Tourist Info office could tell me which/when/where(!)\\n\\n2) there is a Via bus ticket office to the right as you enter the main CAPU hall.  They weren\\'t over-helpful and it was lucky I spoke Spanish as there was no Spanish (it was the same in the Tourist Info office too).  They will ask you to confirm what service on which you want to return from Oriental.  This is tricky as the mini-van services from Oriental to Cantona don\\'t run to any kind of timetable!  So I was sold an open return (70 pesos x 2 + taxes), but the man checking tickets before we got on the bus at CAPU said this wasn\\'t possible and I\\'d have to book a definite service once I got to Oriental.  When I got to Oriental they said no that\\'s fine, its a new type of ticket.  However I had the same problems on the way back (although I was eventually allowed on the bus, thanks to a very helpful female Via member of staff at Oriental.\\n\\nNote that CAPU has plenty of food outlets to stock up on, and several public toilets.\\n\\n3) the bus to Oriental is quite comfortable and takes about 1hr 40 mins.  There is no toilet onboard.  There are several stop before Oriental, and no announcements: Oriental isn\\'t the last stop for the service, so it is worth asking the driver to tell you when you reach the right stop in Oriental as there isn\\'t a recognisable bus station (I nearly missed the stop because of this!).\\n\\n4) there isn\\'t a bus service as such from Oriental to Cantona.  Instead there are white minibuses (\\'combos\\') which are shared between several passengers.  They don\\'t run to any kind of schedule - they just wait until there are enough people.  I was misdirected as to where the combos where, and was a bit annoyed to find after walking 20 mins around the town in the midday heat that there was a pick-up point literally 2 mins walk further down the road from where I got off the Via bus from Puebla!  Look for turquoise building just after the Via ticket - the white minibuses wait on the corner just after that.\\n\\n5) the minibus journey from Oriental to Cantona took about 40 mins, and cost 30 pesos.  The bus makes several stops (all on demand from passengers) in small settlements between the two locations.  Try to agree a return pick-up time at Cantona to go back to Oriental with the driver - although note that doesn\\'t mean they\\'ll turn up! (see below)\\n\\n6) the journey back from Cantona to Oriental is, in short, partly the lap of the gods!  I paid for &amp; agreed my return journey, but the driver didn\\'t turn up: I was lucky after waiting another 25 mins another combo turned up, so I took that one.  I was talking to one of the guides and he said even though the site is open until sunset, after 5pm very few combos come up to the site, and it is quite common for drivers not to turn up even when agreed in advance.  There\\'s no mobile signal at the site, so you can\\'t even try to call a combo/taxi.  The nearest village is Tepeyahualco, 8km away (and not a walk I would ever want to do) but I\\'m not even sure there were taxis there - I certainly didn\\'t see any.  So that\\'s why I advise you go to the site earlier in the day, as there are more combos running and you\\'re not at risk of being stranded if your booked combo doesn\\'t show up.\\n\\n7) note that the combos will drop you off at their waiting area in Oriental, and the stop for the Via bus back to Puebla is on the opposite side of the road to the Via office.  The Via office has a toilet, but there is little seating.\\n\\nEnjoy!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cantona Archaeological Ruins", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c5/02/27/another-impressive-view.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Cantona", "addressLocality": "Puebla", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "333110821": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Outrageously large complex of Ruins", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152773-d1068422-Reviews-Cantona_Archaeological_Ruins-Puebla_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c5/02/27/another-impressive-view.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Cantona is magnificent in every way from the physical infrastructure that still remains (to the vastness of what was once and is lost) without a knowledgeable guide and with alcoholic beverages one could become lost among the remains - HIRE A GUIDE, it is Mexico, they are not expensive! \\n\\nThe very small town of Tepeyahualco has the most lovely ex-Hacienda Hotel you will find in small town Mexico.

Previous reviews tell how incredible this place is. I will add what I did not see before: This site is built up to side of a large hill/small mountain. Every section is terraced so you do quite a bit of climbing. At every turn there are new vistas, ceremonial plazas, pyramids, ball courts. There are lots of signs (in English) explaining each important area so we felt no need for a tour guide. The route is very clearly marked. You can go three different length loops. The first will tale 1-1.5 hours, the second (a continuation of the first) will take 2-2.5 hours, the third (again a continuation) will take 3-3.5 hours. We took the 2.5 hour loops and time flew by. We could have gone on to see the rest. In the distance we saw two other people the whole time. The museum is finished now and is beautiful, well lit, and new and shows many items mentioned in the trail signs. It 55 pesos to get in the site. NOW: To get there, that is the trick. We spent 2 days asking around Puebla. We decided we just did not want to go on public transportation (too much time involved). At the tourist info center (north side zocalo) we went to the desk on the far right. They offered tours at 550 pesos per person with a four person minimum; or you could pay the entire 2,200 pesos and have the tour to yourselves..This included up to 8 hours and an English speaking guide. We offered them 1,800 pesos for just the driver (we did not need the guide) and only a total of 6 hours. They accepted our offer. Our driver, David, knew enough English to explain things we passed. The drive on the toll road was under 1.5 hours. On the way back we took the longer route but saw several small villages with beautiful churches, a saltwater lake made by a meteorite, and endless cactus gardens. We spent 2.5 hours touring the pyramids (hard to call this beautiful city ruins) and were back at the zocalo 6 hours after we left. No photos I have seen even begin to do Cantona justice.

None of the structures individually match the impressive size of, say, the pyramids of the Sun or the Moon at Teotihuacan; but this is a very different site. As you follow the walking trail into Cantona, you climb onto hills that are covered with the ruins, and progressively wider vistas open around you.  This was once a city inhabited by 90,000 people, according to the descriptive text in the site museum, and it must have been a teeming hive of activity.  Now, when you climb to the top of the highest hill on the site and take in the stunning view of the ruins below and the dusty plain and mountains in the distance, all you\\'ll hear is the wind...\\n\\nWe visited on a Thursday and stayed for about three hours.  During that time, we saw seven other tourists and three employees; in total, ten people scattered throughout the site.  If you\\'re driving here from Puebla, it seems easiest to take the toll road route 150.  We took the free road route 129 and had some problems finding our way.  As of March 2014, the access road running between  Cantona and route 150 is well-paved. You don\\'t need to drive down any dirt roads.  The site museum seems new.

Archaeologists think this is the biggest pre-Colobian site in the Americas. They have only excavated about 10% of it, and it takes easily 3 hours to check out in its entirety. The site becomes more dramatic as you get deeper into it. It starts with a long raised stone &quot;street&quot; of sorts, which connected many different living quarters. You begin to note that this really was a city, with streets and houses one after another, densely populated, not unlike a city today. After a brief but steep climb, you get to all the ceremonial and ritual areas. Here there are at least a dozen different ball courts and even more pyramids, one after another after another. They also increase in size. When you get to the far end of the site, you are graced with an expansive sweeping view of the Pico de Orizaba, a beautiful semetrical volcano not far away. Also in the foreground is the rest of the site - unexcavated, covered in cactus. It is not hard to imagine, seeing the small rocky hills - whcih are pyramids - how enormous this place once was. On the way back (you take a loop), you pass some of the biggest pyramids of all and a few grand squares. It can get quite hot out there, and there is little shade, so I recommend bringing water. The site has just a bathroom, a kindly old man who watches your car (please tip him) and a person who charges the minimal entrance fee, though the last time I visited the parking lot attendant said the museum contructed there was about to open. I was told this as well when I visited the site two years prior; we shall see when it actually opens. Anyway, a great undiscovered gem. You won\\'t see stucco paitings or intricate carvings here, but pure grandeur of quantity and size of construction, as well as beautiful cactus filled surroundings and unobstructed mountain views. Hard to get here without a car.

If nothing else, you have to stand on those parapets and become one of the very few Americans who have any idea where Cinco de Mayo originated. There is a very interesting museum within the headquarters building, wbich will provide all the background you can absorb.

This marvelous architectural achievement - a combination of the Renaissance and Baroque styles along with 14 domed chapels - dominates the downtown area landscape of Puebla (especially when lit up during the evening!) \\n\\nI highly suggest walking all around the exterior of the building just to properly soak it all in. Research a little about this legendary church before visiting. I really am emotionally moved by my visits to many of the stunningly-amazing churches in central Mexico, as several have near their main entrance a life-size model of Jesus following his crucifixion (see attached photo). Seeing and relating to the suffering and death of Jesus in this way seems to be a commonality in Mexican culture, and it has a profound impact on this American, as we don\\'t see this kind of thing in the U.S. \\n\\nFinally, if you\\'re looking for a mass to attend, look no further than the Cathedral. The Catholic mass is universal, in that the layout of having the liturgy of the word and Eucharist is the same throughout the word, albeit in different languages. It was amazing to be in the first 20 pews and to experience a holy mass in this church. Even using the hard wooden kneelers (see attached photo) were a nice example of culture shock! And as it was a Sunday evening mass, I was privileged to be one of the only students from my study abroad group to see the Zocalo and Cathedral lit up at night!

Outside, there are two lines, with no one to tell you which line is what. When they let you in they just move you in groups to another waiting area, then to a another waiting (seating) area until you get to the elevator.   Once you take the elevator, you wait upstairs again.   Takes about 15 min to move from area to area, plus the time you spend outside in line.  \\nThe ride is short, tower to tower, the explanations are in Spanish only, and the view depends on the time of day and weather conditions.    I suspect that early morning rides or sunset rides are better.  My view that day was mediocre. \\nWhen you exit your first ride and if you have a round trip ticket (don\\u2019t!) you have to wait for the elevator, go downstairs outside to the back of the line, and wait another hour or more to return.  RIDICULOUS! \\nWe purchased the round trip ticket from the Turibus (don\\u2019t) and did not get preferential priority in line as promised. \\nWe did not use the return trip, ordered uber to get back to town and continued enjoying our day. \\nTip: if you must do this thing, buy a one way ticket and then call uber from the second tower.  I suppose this is a good option for people who have plenty of time and don\\u2019t mind standing up waiting for hours.  \\nHowever, my suggestion is to skip this ride and visit beautiful churches and museums instead.

Only a few blocks away is Los Sapos, where\\u2014 yes, I admit, is a tourist trap during the day\\u2014 but at night, the place is ALIVE and hopping with the locals at all the bars along the Los Sapos strip (which are closed during the day, but all open at night). I know, because I used to live in Puebla and dated a young Poblano. And this was one of our favorite places to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night.

Extensive exhibits of Prehispanic ceramic and stone sculptures tell the story of past religions, artistic achievement, and the significance of the area through Mexican history. There are historical and contemporary folk art exhibits as well. I was particularly fascinated by two exhibits: an interactive room explaining the glyphs that can be found in so many Prehispanic sites, and the videos and digital reconstructions of stages of the Great Pyramid\\'s construction (and sometimes destruction). The museum is beautifully designed and laid out, using traditional as well as progressive exhibition techniques.  Staff are very helpful, and we had a friendly and invaluable discussion with a museum intern. We spent a whole afternoon there, but it could be seen in just an hour or two.

The rich Pre-Hispanic collection that occupies the second floor of the main building had some truly unique pieces that blew our socks off.  There is a fine collection of Mexican folk art and Talavera ceramics.  Also, do not miss the exhibit of alebrijes...fantastical creatures created from paper mache or wood and painted in eye popping colors and patterns, including a towering dragon.  As a frequent visitor to Puebla and Cholula, I can tell you this museum really should be at the top of your list and combines perfectly with a visit to the Cholula pyramid next door.  As a final note, we had a wheelchair bound family member with us and had no difficulties navigating the different buildings that make up the museum.  An elevator takes you to top floor.  \\n\\nSince the museum is so new, it is not widely known yet.  Be amongst the first to discover this jewel.

Si s\\u00f3lo compras el boleto de entrada te permiten una sola vez por actividad, pero el personal  a veces da permiso de m\\u00e1s, son buenas personas.\\n\\nPasando la hora de cierre uno tiene acceso a todo el parque para pasear en bicicleta que ah\\u00ed mismo proporcionan (no hay bicicletas para ni\\u00f1os) que eso le da un valor extra, m\\u00e1s tarde prendieron las &quot;fogatas&quot; y nos dieron bombones y caf\\u00e9 listo para la convivencia con otras familias o en solitario, nos gust\\u00f3.

El fr\\u00edo es muy fuerte as\\u00ed que tomen medidas.\\n\\nEl personal en el restaurante muy atento y aunque pedidmos varias veces hielo, nunca hubo una mala cara o negativa, los precios son moderados y cosas sencillas como un chocolate para un ni\\u00f1o estaba muy caro (80pesos-4 d\\u00f3lares). \\n\\nCuenta con \\u00e1rea de estacionamiento, tienes que avisar que ya vas a usarlo o salir de el para que te abran una reja.\\n\\nContras\\nPor el costo de entrada + Hospedaje + Consumo en restaurante puede resultar elevado adem\\u00e1s de que es mismo precio de adulto y ni\\u00f1os. Por la zona geogr\\u00e1fica no tuvimos se\\u00f1al AT&amp;T y un poco de Telcel, as\\u00ed que fue un enorme problema comunicarnos con la familia y no existe WIFI en el parque, uno va a divertirse y olvidarse de todo, pero para cualquier emergencia, necesidad de comunicaci\\u00f3n o s\\u00f3lo usar Spotify en la noche es imposible, por el costo de hospedarnos deber\\u00eda haber WIFI aunque sea s\\u00f3lo para cuartos. Hay un tel\\u00e9fono en la habitaci\\u00f3n pero es s\\u00f3lo de adorno, no hay l\\u00ednea.\\n\\nEn el restaurante venden unas marcas de refrescos y cervezas, pero si fue molesto que hubiera un problema por llevar una botella ya que nos pod\\u00edan cobrar descorche, entendemos quieran obtener la mayor ganancia posible pero ya fue mucha inversi\\u00f3n como para seguir pagando descorche.\\nUna vez dentro del parque no puedes salir y perder\\u00edas la entrada cosa que no nos gust\\u00f3 ya que en nuestra experiencia en parques y balnearios puedes salir y entrar sin problema al fin de cuentas ya pagaste entrada (mismo problema de las ganancias).\\nEl personal del restaurante junto a la cama el\\u00e1stica muy fr\\u00edo y los tacos una miniatura.\\n\\nLes recomiendo ir a un OXXO y comprar hielo, refrescos, cervezas, botanas ya que el m\\u00e1s cercano est\\u00e1 a 20min en carro y las tienditas del pueblo son muy peque\\u00f1as y modestas.
