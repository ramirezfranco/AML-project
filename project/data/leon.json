The project has quite a bit of parking, both surface and in a parking garage.  Visibility from the adjacent Blvd. Aeropuerto (also known as the Carretera Leon-Silao, and effectively the extension of Av. Adolfo Lopez Mateos south of the intersection with Av. Torres Landa). The project requires some good maneuvering if you are arriving by motor vehicle because of the complexity of the adjacent multi-level interchange.  The project is located just south of the Centro Max shopping center, a Home Depot, a Costco and a Mega hypermarket. This project does not have quite the number of stores that Plaza Mayor (in the north of Leon) has, but it has a better layout and design and offers a better pedestrian experience.  The project presents a bold and colorful facade to Blvd. Aeropuerto.

The collection is surprisingly varied. It\\'s a good way to spend several hours in Leon and a nice way to get some exercise in the city. \\nThe night safari was a lot of fun: there was a musical/dancing presentation in the lobby area, then we moved on to small open buses, and took a guided tour (in Spanish) of the area with the extremely funny and engaging guide. Using a spotlight we were able to see many of the different species present in that part of the zoo, and we were able to hand feed some of the cattle which approached the bus. We were on the bus about 45 mins, and it was entertaining the whole time.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zoologico Leon", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/0f/4e/89/zoologico-leon.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Camino a Ibarrilla s/n", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "37663", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "157535658": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Much better on a cloudy day", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g154240-d3737586-Reviews-Zoologico_Leon-Leon_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/0f/4e/89/zoologico-leon.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "One of the few places in Leon for the kids, the zoo is well maintained.

With me, my brother and my best friend being avid football fans and myself a Barcelona fan, I was more so excited to visit the camp nou and it didn\\'t disappoint. Arriving at around 10am I was worried about large waits for tickets as literally thousands of people flood through the stadium every day. Although there was a long line of people waiting at the ticket office for the \\'camp nou experience\\' the line went down very quickly and tickets were obtained promptly, service was also very friendly. First, we were lucky enough to visit the &quot;Messi area&quot;-a temporary exhibition I believe where his golden boots and balon dor\\'s were displayed-the rush to get pictures with messi\\'s awards was unreal-a lot of pushing tourists but for the vast majority of photo opportunities people were generally polite and courteous allowing each other to have equal photo opportunities. So much to see here including the fantastic museum which is cleverly designed to evoke emotions-which in turn makes you willing to spend a considerable amount of euros on a photo edited image of you with your idol. Well done Barcelona marketing team! You also get to go on the stands, have a sit down and admire the marvel of the stadium, take your picture with the \\'mes que un club&quot; stand behind you. See the tunnel and walk through it up to the pitch. You can also view the away changing rooms, as well as the commentators area of the stadium. Overall, a brilliant trip for any football fan or non football fan alike. Truly a museum/stadium of emotions. Also the museum is not just about football but rather you can view basketball trophies and hockey and futsal trophies. However, price is maybe slightly on the high side for some and the shop is atrociously highly priced!!-although even that is a photo opportunity in itself. I would recommend taking your own food or eating outside of the stadium grounds because the pans company restaurant is highly over priced- nearly \\u20ac3 for a small packet of Burger king sized fries. Also wear comfy shoes-plenty of walking to do. Highly recommend to any fan of football!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Estadio Nou Camp", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/39/01/e0/dsc-0856-largejpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Boulevard Adolfo Lopez Mateos Oriente 1810", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "37500", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "188987869": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Very good experience! 23 Euros per 1 ticket", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g154240-d2032524-Reviews-Estadio_Nou_Camp-Leon_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/39/01/e0/dsc-0856-largejpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I visited the Camp Nou, 23 euro each, including a Museum tour (pictures and all of the awards) and the internal stadium tour up to the field!

MOst of the problem is size...many shoes may go to nine but that is it for women.  I found Purse store where prices were 33$ and they look and feel like 150$ purse.  THe store is on the upper level about half way and only sells good purses...good display too. I bought three and wish I had gotten some more for family and friends.  FLexi shoes for men were from 800-1200 pesos...a very nice shoe, not super high end though there were a few..wing tip shoes were about 1200 pesos or sixty dollars.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Plaza del Zapato", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/3f/7d/30/20161007-134117-largejpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Blvd. Alvaro Obregon # 261", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "430671535": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nice but small!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g154240-d547626-Reviews-Plaza_del_Zapato-Leon_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/3f/7d/30/20161007-134117-largejpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "It is a nice plaza, cozy but small!\\nYou immediately feel the need to find more stores to have more choices of shoes!

Also, I remember seeing many stores that offer many pretty, sophisticated and modern styles for men, women and children contrary to what another reviewer mentioned about seeing only cowboy boots. I also saw some of the reviews mention that you can walk up two streets and find another mall with shoes and leather goods, yes it is true! but you have to be aware that many of those shops sell counterfeit items. A few years ago this same mall was being bombarded by outside companies (mostly the ones that manufacture in China) and thus they were selling lower quality and many times counterfeit products to tourists. The locals complained about it to the government given the fact that Le\\u00f3n is known for its leather products, especially its boots. If you are looking to spend less money then I would suggest going to the neighboring towns, like Celaya.
