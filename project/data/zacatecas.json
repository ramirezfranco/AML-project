This is a very small site of ruins with a small pyramid (Votiva), ceremonial site surrounded by stone columns, and the remnants of a few rooms. Each site is marked with a sign in both English and Spanish, but if you want a little more detail, there are guides at the entrance who will take you up to the top for a a dollar or two and a tip. Entrance is only 50 pesos. \\nVery few people make the trip to this site, so you\\'re likely to have the entire hike to yourself, as we did. The views are fantastic, spanning 180\\u00b0 to almost 300\\u00b0 at a time, and by the time you hike to the top, you will have seen almost all sides. The view includes the mountains, flat farmland that stretches forever, and clear, blue sky. There\\'s no shade there and the sun was quite warm, even in November, so bring a hat and sunscreen. \\nThe hike only takes about an hour to go up, maybe twenty minutes down. It\\'s almost all steps of natural uneven large rocks, or cut stone steps, some of which are gigantic (about knee high). It\\'s a bit of cardio, I won\\'t lie. I recommend going in the morning when it\\'s a little cooler. \\n\\nThere are nice restroom facilities at the foot of the trail (though there wasn\\'t any toilet paper or soap), but nothing but nature once you start the trail. There aren\\'t any restaurants or food stands inside the front gate, but I think I saw a street stand back out at the highway. \\n\\nThese ruins are located off the main highway 54 about 40 minutes south of Zacatecas and 20 minutes north of Villanueva. There are buses that run to Villanueva and will let you off roadside at the turn off to the ruins; however, there was some confusion on the bus when I was asking for &quot;La Quemada&quot;. Other passengers kept asking if I had family there. Apparently, to the locals - including the bus driver - &quot;La Quemada&quot; refers to a large area of ranchland. If you plan to walk to the entrance, be sure to ask the bus driver to let you off at &quot;Las Ruinas&quot;. I believe the exit sign is the other name for the site - Chicomoztoc.\\n\\nWe decided to continue on the bus to the next town, Villanueva, after passengers explained that it\\'s a few miles from the turn off to the entrance gate at the ruins (with nothing to see). Taxis do not pass there, so rather than walk that, we went to Villanueva by bus and took a taxi to the ruins entrance. It was a 7-minute taxi ride from the turn off to the gate (20 min total from Villanueva and about 180 pesos). \\n \\n*Villanueva is not a place to spend the day, nor grab a bite. It\\'s extremely small and quaint and devoid of restaurants. We wanted to grab a bite around 10am and walked in circles until we finally found a tiny restaurant to grab some tortas. Better to eat before leaving Zacatecas. \\n\\nMany people hire a taxi to wait at the bottom for two hours, but we didn\\'t because I wasn\\'t sure how long we\\'d be there, so we hitched a ride back out to the highway in our guide\\'s truck. Once there, we caught a passing combi van after about 20 minutes. \\n\\nIn sum, if you have a half day to spare and you\\'re up for a hike away from the tourists, hop over to Las Ruinas/Piramide Voltiva/La Quemada/Chicomoztoc, where it takes longer to figure out its actual name than to hike it. \\n\\nHope that helps!

It also has a  concrete mini-plaza area with four very large bronze statues of Mexican Revolutionary War Heroes. There are basic restrooms (5 pesos) and garbage cans. There are souvenir stands and a snack bar with soda, chips, elote, and I think tacos and quesadillas. There\\'s a small church with a museum on site, as well, but I can\\'t comment on it since it was already closed when we visited. I believe they both close early, around 3 or 4pm. \\nBehind the statues is a small trail (5 minute walk up stairs and a concrete path)  that leads to the mausoleum and another viewpoint. There aren\\'t any garbage cans there, so be sure to finish your food below or carry your trash back with you.\\n\\nLa Bufa is a nice place to go to take a look around and see the entire city below. But it\\'s not a bustling &quot;mini town&quot;, as some reviewers imply. I can\\'t see spending more than an hour there. It\\'s no &quot;Bas\\u00edlica de Santa Maria de Guadalupe&quot;  (Mexico City), but it\\'s worth a look around and some photos. \\n\\n**Transportation Info**\\nThe telef\\u00e9rico to La Bufa is no longer an option as the tram operation has been suspended indefinitely while residents and environmental groups battle the  government over the proposed project to expand the tram system. \\n\\n     However, you can still go to La Bufa overlook by:\\n1. Taxi or Uber (about 75 - 100 pesos, depending on where you start), and the ride takes roughly 15 minutes. \\n\\n2. There\\'s also a train tram (like an amusement park tram) that shuttles visitors up and down the hill. I don\\'t know where the pick-up point is in town, or how much it costs, though. I just saw it waiting at La Bufa for customers. \\n\\n3. You can climb the stairs and alleys through the town. I recommend taking a taxi to the hill, then walking DOWN the stairs. It takes about 20-30 minutes to walk back down (mostly steps and downhill narrow streets) to end up at the main Catedral de Zacatecas on Hidalgo.  *I wouldn\\'t walk through the neighborhoods at night; however, as the alleys are dark and a bit dicey, but by day or sunset, it\\'s a nice walk.\\n\\n *The stairs back down to the city are accessed from a staircase found between the main plaza and the mausoleum. It\\'s easy to find. Then just walk down about 4 or 5 flights of stairs until you reach the city edge and the main road. Cross the highway and continue down the staircase lined with houses. Then you wind through the streets and alleys in a sort of switchback fashion in search of stairs. It\\'s very easy to get back to town, but not direct. The most direct manner (by foot) would be to follow the main highway once you reach it (instead of crossing it), but it\\'s not at all scenic. \\n\\nHope that helps! Enjoy Zacatecas!

The visit of the cathedral can be fruitfully coupled with the visit of this Palace, which contains a historical museum of the city and lots of murals in the stairway that goes up to the first floor: admission is free.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Catedral de Zacatecas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/82/18/34/cathedral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Hidalgo 617", "addressLocality": "Zacatecas", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "98000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "653512148": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "magical Holyday visit", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152772-d153312-Reviews-Catedral_de_Zacatecas-Zacatecas_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/82/18/34/cathedral.jpg", "datePublished": "February 19, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Zacatecas is a city with many attractions any time of the year.

It was exploited by the Spanish conquerors starting from the end of the 16th century, and its operations continued until 1965, when it was closed because the mine was too close to the city centre. Thereafter it was adapted as a museum, a tourist attraction, and an entertainment place (I was told that there is a discotheque in its bowels). This mine is a must for any visitor of Zacatecas. \\n\\nThe mine is practically in town. The entrance is on the slopes of the &quot;La Bufa&quot; hill, but there is also a second entrance nearer to the Z\\u00f3calo, which is however used only as an exit. The visit is very informative and educational; it is guided and is carried out in small groups; it lasts about one hour, plus the time needed for visiting the museum, which is also located within the mine. The visit starts at the upper entrance, where a lift brings you into the bowels of the mine; you are then guided through a certain number of tunnels and terminate your visit in the museum; then you are transported by train to the lower entrance of the mine, from where you exit.\\n\\nThe guides are very competent, but in most visits the explanations are given in Spanish language. The guides narrate the history of mining in this area, from the pre-Hispanic times until today; they describe the horrible conditions in which the miners had to work, often accompanied by their children who, in case that their father died, had to replace him in the work; they illustrate the dangers incurred by the miners, from the f\\u0131redamp gas (gris\\u00f9) to the flooding, from the poisoning caused by arsenic and chromium to the painful death by silicosis. They also illustrate the techniques used for mining and show the silver veins still present in the walls and in the vaults of the tunnels, together with the veins of other minerals. The working conditions are clearly represented by reconstructions made with life-size manikins wearing the clothes of the time and holding the instruments of the time. The visit terminates at the museum, where a rich collect\\u0131on of samples of the various minerals is displayed. At the end of the visit it is customary to tip the guide.\\n\\nThe mine is open every day from 10:00 to 18:00.

This is one of the most visited mines in Mexico. It\\'s within walking distance from Zacatecas Centro (about 10 min.), just one block past Parque Alameda. The tour is interesting and you get to walk through a few (restored) tunnels of a real mine. Entry fee is 80 pesos ($4). \\n\\n The mine has seven levels, but the tour only takes place on two of them. There are many platforms with railings that were built along the tour path that allow visitors to peer down at the lower levels. If you\\'ve been in a mine before, you may not be as impressed, as this mine is quite touristy; it\\'s renovated with dramatic colored lighting, a smooth, wide walking path, and viewing platforms. However, the explanation of the history of the area, importance and development of the mine, and the hardships of the miners was very good. For those wanting a photo op at a unique place, come back in the evening to the underground club. The tour passes by it and points it out. \\n\\nI think the tour is ideal for families with kids because it begins with a little train shuttle ride into the mine and then there are many lighted props and figures throughout the tour. Be prepared for a lot of waiting around, though. The tour is roughly 1 hr, but you only spend about 30 minutes actually touring the mine.\\n\\nThey run a tour about every hour or two, so while you\\'re waiting for the next tour group to assemble, there\\'s a snack bar near the ticket booth. When the tour begins, you put on a plastic helmet and board a little shuttle that takes you inside the long first tunnel, descending about 1,500 feet into the mine. Then you disembark and are led to the rock and mineral display, and after a few words about minerals that were mined here, the guide leaves you to peruse the mini museum and use the restrooms before the walking tour begins. There aren\\'t any restrooms inside the tunnels, so 20 minutes is spent here, basically waiting for everyone to have an opportunity to use the restrooms. It was a pretty long wait. \\nThen the guide assembled the group and we walked a long, wide tunnel as he explained about the history of the mine and area. Mannequin figures are found at each stopping point to help visitors visualize the mining conditions. Then we walked up a flight of stairs to a higher path for more of the same.\\n The tour was entirely in Spanish and although our guide, Cristian, was very friendly and conscious of speaking slower for me, I found it very difficult to understand him because I couldn\\'t hear him over the crying babies, whining toddlers, and the three kids running around playing tag and calling out to each other. (That\\'s what I get for visiting in the mid-afternoon during prime Cranky Kid Time.) So after a while, I just gave up and trailed behind. I think I would\\'ve enjoyed the tour more if I had been able to hear more than half of what was said.  You\\'d probably have better luck with a quieter, smaller group if you visited the mine when it first opens in the morning. \\n\\nThere are many platforms with railings overlooking open spaces, where you can  look down at the river that flooded and washed out the lower levels of the mine in the 60s, effectively shutting it down.  It\\'s visible despite the darkness because it glows a bright metallic blue, due to the minerals and sediment the water carries with it as it runs through the hill, La Bufa, before flowing into the mine. It almost looks radioactive.\\n\\nAt the end of the tour, the guide presented us with 3 different options:\\n1. Climb a set of stairs to more paths in the mine and continue the tour with another guide.\\n2. Turn back and walk to the train for the return ride to the entrance.\\n3. Walk to a different tunnel to the elevator which leads to the upper exit and the teleferico (which he warned us is no longer running) and street above. \\n\\nWe chose option 3, and had the tunnel all to ourselves since the rest of the group headed back to the train. With everyone else gone, the mine became deathly quiet and in the darker stretches of the tunnel, we started to identify with Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher, wondering if we should\\'ve been marking our path...and if it\\'s even possible to get lost in a tourist mine . .?  We giggled as we started second-guessing the directions we were given. Just as I started to wonder if anyone has ever had to spend the night in a chilly mine, we saw footpath lights up ahead, and soon after, the elevators. I think I was actually disappointed. \\n\\nThere is nothing at this exit now that the tram is no longer running, but we planned to catch a taxi to the Cerro La Bufa. This proved more difficult than we had anticipated as the road outside is a very narrow side street with no passing cars.  We decided to walk up the road in search of a taxi, since Hotel Baruk was about 5 minutes up the road, rather than walk over a mile back down to the lower mine entrance. (Visitors may not re-enter the mine after exiting, so don\\'t exit at the top unless you plan to do as we did). At the hotel, we caught a taxi to La Bufa, which was about a 15 minute ride, and after checking it out, walked back to town using the flights of stairs that eventually lead to the Catedral Zacatecas. \\n\\nHaving been in several mines before, I still felt Eden was worth seeing, as the presentation of the mine was striking, and the tour informative. Personally, I enjoyed wandering around in the dark, empty tunnel after the tour, but if that\\'s not your cup of tea, just stick with the herd headed back to the train. \\n\\nHope that helps! Enjoy Zacatecas! \\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Mina El Eden", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/06/aa/64/zacatecas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Cerro Grillo", "addressLocality": "Zacatecas", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "450992354": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Intresting!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152772-d153081-Reviews-Mina_El_Eden-Zacatecas_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/06/aa/64/zacatecas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "La mina El Eden is THE &quot;must see&quot; place in Zacatecas: a little scaring train trip take you to the heart of the &quot;Mina&quot;.

But as it wasn\\'t too far a walk to the entrance of the mine from Gorditas Do\\u00f1a Julia, where I had had a quick lunch, and because it was an easy way to get the Teleferico entrance, I figured I\\'d give it a go. \\n\\nIt was not crowded the day I went - just two guys from Sonora and me, which was fine. You enter the mine from this entrance in a small and very short train. Because you have to wear a hard heart (provided) and because I am tall (6\\'3) this short trip proved a tiny bit tough as my head kept hitting the top of the train. Hey, but I was wearing a hard hat, so no problem, right? Anyway, the train stops in the middle of the mine, where there is sort of a museum of minerals and fossils. The guide (and more on that in a second) walks along and tells stories and provides info while also giving you time to look around and see what is on display at your pace. They also give you a glimpse down another shaft at the disco that is there (open at night). Then you are walked to other parts of the mine where you see and hear more on the conditions of the workers in their day as well as some local mine legends. Eventually you get to the end and have the option of going back from when you came or heading to the other exit, where you can catch the Teleferico. All in all pretty handy. By the way, there are gift shops, snacks and clean restrooms available at both ends.\\n\\nNow onto the guide. My guide was a youngish woman (18~22?) named Jackie (not sure of the spelling). When I first arrived at the mine, I bought my ticket and walked up to the entrance gate. Jackie zoomed and explained that the postcard that I had received as a receipt was also my ticket, and then explained when the tour would leave, etc. She then switched to perfect English (apparently having had lived in Texas) and asked me where I was from and told me she could explain as much to me on the tour as I liked (a nice touch since I was trying to learn Spanish and thus wanted to try to follow along when I could). She offered to take pics of me with my camera at popular along the way because I was there alone, provided me with good explanations when I wasn\\'t able to follow along, and basically took very good care of me on the tour, as well as of the other customers. So basically here is a shout out to a really good and helpful guide who started off my trip in Zacatecas right. \\n\\nAnyway, to sum up, the tour is actually pretty nice (good escape from the heat as well), and a great way to get to the Teleferico station.

When you arrive at El Eden you need to put a helmet on your head to enter in this place, then, there is a little poky train to takes you inside the mine. \\nIn addition to this, the streets of the downtown are bustling with many people buying craftworks and typical clothes.\\nSo, You need to visiting Zacatecas.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Mina El Eden", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/06/aa/64/zacatecas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Cerro Grillo", "addressLocality": "Zacatecas", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "346426911": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Mina el.eden ", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152772-d153081-Reviews-Mina_El_Eden-Zacatecas_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/06/aa/64/zacatecas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Nice place to visit with family.or.friends is a minning place with some nice stores inside nice rocks and history insude of the place ", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Mina El Eden", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/06/aa/64/zacatecas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Cerro Grillo", "addressLocality": "Zacatecas", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "345957253": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Interesting", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152772-d153081-Reviews-Mina_El_Eden-Zacatecas_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/06/aa/64/zacatecas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "It was a very good experience visiting this mine.

I\\'m not sure if they offer tours every hour or just when they collect enough people. I waited about 20 minutes and the group was about 8 or 9 people, which was a bit too large for the small rooms.\\nYou first walk up a flight of stairs, and then weave in and out of about 6 or 7 small rooms, often exiting through the same doorway you entered. It\\'s very dark (to set the mood), and the wood floor planks are uneven in some places, and sometimes the doorways have a small lip, so watch your step. There\\'s no wheelchair access. \\nFor each room, the guide explains the  historical time frame, purpose of the instruments of torture (type of pain infliction), and reasons for punishment (victims).\\nIn sum, this is a cheap, quick tour that can be fit in between or after other activities.

Te\\u00fal is one of Mexico\\u2019s Pueblos M\\u00e1gicos, or Magic Cities and well deserves the name. I found the houses pretty, the streets clean and well paved, and there seemed to be picturesque arches everywhere. It can also be said that everywhere you wander in this town, you can always see the Cerro de Te\\u00fal on the horizon, so stately and imposing that even the notorious Conquistador Nu\\u00f1o Beltr\\u00e1n de Guzm\\u00e1n, remarked upon its grandeur.\\n\\nOn October 5, 2018, the archaeological site on the Cerro was inaugurated, and it seemed the whole town turned out for the event. There was standing room only as politician after politician alluded to the deep love of the local people for this mountain of theirs and to the wholehearted support the archaeologists had received for their project. \\u201cMy friends,\\u201d archaeologist Laura Soler told the crowd, \\u201cWe are finally finished doing our work and we will no longer keep you away from your beloved pe\\u00f1ol. From now on it will be open to the public every day of the week but Monday.\\u201d\\n\\nI learned that excavations and studies had been carried out by Soler and archaeologist Peter Jim\\u00e9nez for ten long years and that this particular site is considered of monumental importance because it was occupied continuously for 17 to 19 centuries, so its history matches and reflects the history of northwestern Mexico.\\n\\nA very wide, smooth, well-marked trail leads from the town up the mountainside, with stairs built in a few strategic places and occasional shaded spots with benches where you can catch your breath and take a rest. The most dramatic \\u201crest stop\\u201d is a very long shelter cave with seats carved into the living rock by ancient peoples. Here you can sit in the shade and enjoy a magnificent, panoramic view of Teul de Gonz\\u00e1lez. Also carved into the rock wall are horizontal and vertical channels for collecting the spring water which oozes out of this mountain at various points.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s good that there are plenty of places to rest along the trail, because this is one steep hill, with a vertical difference of 171 meters between the town and the shaft tomb up at the very top, but it\\u2019s only a one-kilometer walk through spectacular scenery. Scattered along the way are well-designed explanatory signs (sorry, entirely in Spanish), each of which is linked to an app called \\u201cExplora Cerro del Te\\u00f9l\\u201d which you can download free from the Google Play Store. The app uses GPS to recognize where you are and presents lots of info, cartoon style. People were oohing and ahhing about this ultramodern guide, but as for me, I\\u2019d still rather read a sign than squint at a tiny screen obviously not designed for bright sunlight.\\n\\nUp, up you go and suddenly you reach a wide, flat area with a plaza, the ruins of a pyramid and a sunken patio where great crowds used to gather for \\u201cMitote Ceremonies,\\u201d dances held, for example, in May to assure the arrival of the rains and in October or November asking the gods to end them. Here the archaeologists found many fragments of simple ceramics that had been used to prepare food for these big crowds. \\n\\nSomething else the archaeologists found buried beneath this patio, I was surprised to learn, were around 60 skeletons, probably the remains of ancient VIPs. \\u201cThese people,\\u201d Laura Soler told us, \\u201ctypically had artificially flattened heads and their teeth had been filed to sharp points.  All these skeletons have been sent off for study by bioarchaeologists, but there are probably many more bodies under here that we haven\\u2019t uncovered yet, just a few centimeters beneath your feet.\\u201d\\n\\nA few steps from the patio we came to the I-shaped ball court, which is very nicely preserved. There, our guide showed us two of four big statues carved in stone, which had once stood at the four extremities of the ball court. \\u201cThese figures,\\u201d said Soler, \\u201care shown dressed in the typical sportswear and gloves of the day.\\u201d\\n\\nMost curious of all was the fact that one of the four statues found here had been deliberately sculpted in two parts: a body and a head, apparently in relation to the preHispanic custom of honoring the captain of the winning team with decapitation.\\n\\nA few steps up above the ball court, you come to the last feature of the archaeological tour: a shaft tomb, clearly indicating how far back the Cerro del Te\\u00fal goes. This method of burial was in vogue 2000 years ago, but probably died out around 400 AD. The pit or shaft could be as deep as 20 meters, with several chambers at the bottom, each containing at least one body accompanied by many ofrendas, offerings\\u2026perhaps in the thousands. To protect the tomb from looting, the shaft would typically be filled back in with dirt.\\n\\nBack down at the Visitors Center, who did I bump into but Peter Jim\\u00e9nez, with whom I had previously corresponded\\u2014all in Spanish\\u2014without ever realizing he spoke English. \\u201cActually, I\\u2019m from Rochester, Minnesota,\\u201d he told me. \\u201cI came to Mexico to study archaeology when I was 17 and I just stayed here. I\\u2019ve been doing archaeology here in Zacatecas for 34 years.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow long have you been involved in this project?\\u201d I asked Jim\\u00e9nez.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, I first came here to Te\\u00fal in 1984, hoping to work on this site, but we realized that the ruins at La Quemada, further north in Zacatecas, were in dreadful condition and we\\u2019d better fix that place up before starting on a new one. At one time I had 520 people working for me at La Quemada, picking up the stones so we could put everything back together again. That site was like an old man in an emergency room, with kidney problems, liver problems and brain problems. So we had to do emergency archaeology there to save the site.\\u201d\\n\\nEventually Jim\\u00e9nez came back to Te\\u00fal, where he has been working for ten years. \\u201cThe Cerro del Te\\u00fal is tremendously important,\\u201d he told me. \\u201cWhile La Quemada had only about six years of occupation, Te\\u00fal has been continuously occupied for 15 to 16 centuries, stretching from the Shaft-Tomb period to the arrival of the Spaniards. It shows us that dramatic changes did not mean people died or vanished, but simply that new ideas came along and the directionality vector changed. People started imitating lifestyles from somewhere else. Long-duration sites like this one at Te\\u00fal help us to see these changes.\\u201d\\n\\nThe newly opened archaeological site has a Visitors\\u2019 Center, restrooms and a First Aid Center and is open Tuesdays to Sundays from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. To get there, ask Google to take you to \\u201cZona arqueologico del Teul.\\u201d", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cerro del Teul", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/fc/42/04/portales-del-teul-de.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Hill of Cerro del Teul", "addressLocality": "Zacatecas", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "610333376": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Strenuous but beautiful hike", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152772-d7396118-Reviews-Cerro_del_Teul-Zacatecas_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/fc/42/04/portales-del-teul-de.jpg", "datePublished": "August 25, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "If you like history and beautiful views, this is the hike for you. The climb to the very top of the hill is strenuous but the trail is now well maintained with frequent rest stations with benches and shade. Cerro del Te\\u00fal, Cerro del Sombrero or the Caxcan hill top community of Tonaycac\\u00e1n, &quot;from where the mother watches&quot;,  is an active archaeological site with exciting discoveries being made. The site is currently the longest continuously inhabited site in Mexico and its record is reshaping our understanding of Mesoamerican cultures. The hill is an Atlpetl, a &quot;water hill&quot; both in the literal and metaphoric sense. Springs of water flow from one side of the hill and Atllpetl was the nahuatl name used to describe religious and cultural centers of influence in Mesoamerica. Some of the uncovered artifacts have been a sunken plaza complete with a small pyramid, a ball court with a pair of statues at one end that allude to the hero twins of the Popol Vuh. Also, undisturbed shaft tombs, a copper furnace and many other artifacts dating up to the most recent inhabitants, the Caxcan confederacy. If you look at the hill as you climb, you will see parapets. These were built to defend the hill from rival indigenous nations and lastly from Spanish invaders. Nu\\u00f1o de Guzman or as he was known among his peers, &quot;Bloody Guzman&quot;, attempted to conquer the region with violence and imposing slavery on the indigenous communities. Guzman\\'s behavior was so extreme that even his Spanish soldiers were aghast. He was taken back to Spain and tried but Guzman\\'s actions sparked the Mixton War, a conflict between the Spanish colonizers and their Tlaxcaltec allies and a united indigenous alliance of nations which challenged Spanish colonial power so severely that they considered abandoning the region altogether. The hill played a role as a pe\\u00f1ol hill fortress where the Caxcanes and their allies resisted the Spanish for many years. After a peace was achieved, the present town of Te\\u00fal was founded as a villa. A villa was a place where indigenous people were instructed by the Spanish indigenous allies into the new ways of Spanish colonial society. The very top of the hill, offers stunning views of the town and surrounding area. I recommend starting early in the morning or late in the afternoon as the sun may make it hard to climb. Bring comfortable shoes, pants (ticks are common) and plenty of water.
