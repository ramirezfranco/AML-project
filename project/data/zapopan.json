Information about the Jalisco location pre-game was limited or was available too late to be helpful, stadium seating configuration obstructed viewing, and security and access to and within the stadium were at best disorganized.\\n\\nInformation about the Guadalajara, Jalisco Stadium location was made available weeks (nearly months) after information and ticket sales for the first round (D bracket) were available. Even when ticket information was available, seating charts available on line at time of ticket purchase indicated large areas only, rather than where specific seats were, and no sense of whether tickets purchases were on the 1st base or 3rd base side of stadium. A detailed seating chart was posted outside the main gates, but this information was not available through MLB or tickemaster Mexico at ticket purchase time. On the second day of the series (Friday 10 March 2017) we attempted to upgrade our tickets (B-type, BUT220, at $1622 pesos apiece), but were informed this was impossible. We were told that ticketmaster Mexico had control of the tickets, and our only option was to buy, at full price, tickets in the location we desired.\\n\\nEven with modifications, the Jalisco Guadalaraja stadium, designed for Pan Am Games,  setup is not to MLB standard. The temporary seating in the wings (red section) on both sides does is insufficiently raked and the long walkway along the front meant that anyone seated in the red sections had to use this access to get to and from their seats. In addition, security and other staff also used the walkway, as well as vendors (who typically stood in front of the crowd concerned only with making sales, oblivious to the fact that they constantly blocked the game. The number of vendors was also excessive.  In MLB stadiums, major walkways such as this are set below seating in order to ensure viewing is not obstructed. In Jalisco, this was not the case, and view of the games was constantly obstructed (we can provide numerous photos to demonstrate this).  \\n\\nSecurity at the Jalisco Guadalajara Stadium involved military, police, and two (one internal one external) private security firms. We were required to show our tickets a minimum of four times in order to reach our seat. This ticket showing was directly related to keeping us as contained as possible within the stadium \\u2013 contained to the point of near claustrophobia. Truly we could only access our seating area. It was not possible to access the same area on the other side of the stadium to take pictures during batting practice (up to 3 hours before game start). No information about these severe restrictions within stadium was posted online.\\n \\nSecurity at the Jalisco Guadalajara did little or nothing to control the public. Over the four days we were there, our bags were never searched. People we met did have their bags searched, but only to have baseballs (brought to the stadium with the hope of getting players\\u2019 signatures) confiscated \\u2013 for \\u201csafety\\u201d reasons (even though baseballs were sold in the stadium store). We witness people pulling full bottles of alcohol from their bags, as well as smoking in the stadium, and (as noted in the news) fights broke out. \\n\\nAccess to and within the stadium were at best disorganized: three hours early on Thursday and Friday, one hour on Saturday, and two hours on Sunday. On Saturday, exit after the first game and re-entry for the second was disorganized to the point of dangerous. Security at the gate at barely manages to collect ticket stubs.\\n\\nFurther evidence of the lack of preparation and readiness to host an MLB sponsored even was evident at the airport upon departure from Guadalajara. Security at the Guadalajara airport confiscated baseballs in carry-on luggage, again \\u201cfor security\\u201d reasons. \\n\\nWe have contacted Major League Baseball, but they have put the responsibility for this  on Ticketmaster, Mexico.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "1"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Estadio de Beisbol Charros de Jalisco", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/27/42/33/estadio-de-beisbol-charros.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Santa Lucia 373 Colonia Tepeyac", "addressLocality": "Zapopan", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "45150", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "466406238": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "World Classic Baseball Estadium/ Sede Latam", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g1006488-d11806218-Reviews-Estadio_de_Beisbol_Charros_de_Jalisco-Zapopan_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/27/42/33/estadio-de-beisbol-charros.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "nice stadium, small but very new, you can park at streets and pay 100 pesos o r use uber. the access is very quick, a big store, a lot of food kioscs with mexican or snacks. inside nice view, confortable seats, Charros is the local team and we sent for world classics baseball!!

The Stadium wasn\\'t formerly a baseball stadium and you can tell somehow once you are in the field. Anyway the place is very confortable and you can enjoy the game wherever you are seated. If something can be improved is the food options. The variety is high, maybe too high and that\\'s why even with the stadium full you never feel like they are working hard. You know the feeling when you want to order but it looks like they never turn on the kitchen. You want to see the orders coming out, the cooking aroma, the crowd. You\\'ll never see this here. You feel like they just heated something they brought from their hq. Maybe less options better selected would work better. I\\'ve been in big stadiums where there are 3 options, the best hot dog, an amazing pizza and an extraordinary hamburguer. That\\'s it. Besides the food, parking and prices could also be improved but is not too bad right now. Overall the experience is very good and baseballs is becoming an option in the city. Congratulations!

Since then, various reforestation plans have produced impressive growths of eucalyptus, pine, ash, oak, acacia and silk-cotton trees, among others.\\n\\nThe eucalyptus grove near the highway is wide and flat: a fine place to have a picnic or just let the kids run wild, and it even has public toilets. However, if you walk only 600 meters east, the scene changes dramatically. You come to low hills and steep arroyos covered with smaller trees, bushes, wild flowers, thorns and fox tails. Here there are very large, smooth rocks whose tips barely break the surface. There\\u2019s also a small lake where you can always find plenty of ducks. Turning north on one of the many trails running through the area, you eventually come to a steep cliff overlooking the community of Las Ca\\u00f1adas.

Centinela means \\u201csentinel\\u201d and you\\u2019ll see several of them keeping watch from high on the tower, 24 hours a day.\\n\\nHow to get there\\nTake the Ring Road (Perif\\u00e9rico) north to Plaza San Isidro Shopping Center. Here take Avenida Camino a Bosque de San Isidro 2.16 kilometers north and carefully watch for a big Bienvenido sign on your right. Next to the sign is a large iron gate to the park, but the public is not allowed to use it. Instead, immediately past the gate, you\\u2019ll find a small, easy-to-miss entrance to an unpaved public parking area. Leave your car here and walk a few steps to the trail head of an easy 1.8-kilometer-long hike (N20.76146 W103.38206) at the southwest corner of the park.You can download the 1.8-kilometer trail to your smartphone by going to Wikiloc.com and searching for \\u201cCentinela Loop One.\\u201d Driving time from the Perif\\u00e9rico to the Park: about 4 minutes.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Bosque El Centinela", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/cc/be/a8/this-is-a-favorite-area.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av.

While we were there we walked around the town.  \\n\\n    We visited the small modern art museum, Possibly called MAZ (Museo Arte de Zapopan)  This small museum hosts rotating exhibits and may not have a permanent collection.  On the day we were there the only exhibit had to do with sustainable agriculture.  there was a rooftop of corn in five rows of planter boxes and a room that celebrated corn with, among other things, a wheelbarrow full of popcorn.  I suppose you could recreate either of these fascinating works of art in your home.   The young folks at the desk said that a new exhibit was opening the next day, but we were not permitted a preview.  Que lasstima.\\n\\n    We walked across a small plaza and were attracted by a building from which was emanating martial band music.  The guard (who stood in front of an impressive carved door) invited us in and we ran upstairs to the lobby of a conference room where a band was playing.  We listened to two stirring marches after which the band put away their instruments and left.  As near as we could tell, this fanfare was for the alcalde and the city council conducting a hearing.  A very interesting look at Mexican culture...they really like their military bands.  \\n\\n    The municipal building also had a fine mural in the stairwell.  On the main floor there was a notice posted to the effect that you did not have to have sex with your boss to retain your job.  Good to know!\\n\\n    In the same neighborhood there was a small but interesting shopping district and a mercado.  Inside the mercado there were several food stalls where we bought lunch  and a guy selling tripe, which is something you don\\'t see every day in the EUA.   \\n\\n    Zapopan ios definitely worth a visit for the basilica nad its large planted square.
