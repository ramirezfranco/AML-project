There were some cool tablets they had set up, but most are pretty worn down and the signage is missing on quite a few that tells you what the tablet is all about.\\nI have to say Grupo B was my favorite, because there is just this HUGE mound of dirt, leaves, and rocks with trees growing on it, and underneath is a well buried temple.  I just kept tripping out on the whole thing, because there is was, totally hidden in plain sight, with little kids riding bikes on top of it.  If that was the United States, it would be fenced off, completely dug through, and they would be charging admission.\\nHere all you did was sign a guest book and walk wherever you wanted.\\nThere is a lot more I could say, and some people who visit are probably totally disappointed, because there is not much going on at these places.  But I thought it was super cool, and a total trip, because I am from Los Angeles, and everything in L.A. is so polished and overdone, and here we were walking all over places that are pretty much left alone and waiting to be excavated.

There has been a great deal of effort (and expense) made to develop a very nice cruise ship terminal area and the local people try very hard to make it a nice experience for cruise ship travelers.  There are two big (and I do mean big) Palapa terminal buildings.  \\n\\nThe main Palapa has several small shops, selling souvenirs (Amber, Silver, Jade jewelry - nice stuff; Coffee for $8 per bag, T-Shirts/clothes/bags).  It has large clean bathrooms and located next to them (on the wall) is a RED mailbox.  You can buy/mail your postcards from here.  Postcards sell here 3 for $2 USD and International stamps cost $1 USD each.  There\\u2019s also an Internet Cafe selling wi-fi at $3 for 20 minutes. \\n\\nThe other Palapa has a restaurant/bar and a swimming pool. So if you don\\u2019t want to go to town, you can find things to do at the terminal for a few hours.\\n\\nCruise lines offer shore excursions but inside the main Palapa you can easily get shuttle transportation into Tapachula (and go on your own) or book a tour from the people selling them inside.  There is a tourist information booth that will offer you advice. Tapachula (meaning &quot;Between the Waters\\u201d) is approx. 15 minutes away from the cruise port.  Don\\u2019t hesitate to go to Tapachula on your own, the people are nice.  Just keep in mind it is a small city and walking around to see the people and sights, will be your main entertainment.\\n\\nWe visited the House of Culture and the Soconusco Museum of Archeology in Tapachula where they have some artifacts that were originally found at Izapa.  It\\u2019s small (2 floors) and you can see most of it within 10 minutes but there are a few nice pieces; don\\u2019t miss the turquoise skull on the main floor. Washrooms are also located on the main floor.\\n\\nThen we went to the Izapa ruins which is 10 Km away (approx. 20 minutes) from Tapachula.  The site is small (you can see it in under 1 hour) but worth a visit if you like visiting ruins.  The site has a variety of plants - fruit trees and flowers and a few local vendors selling souvenirs - handicrafts, nice carvings, chocolate, bottled water and coke/other soft drinks - for reasonable prices (bargain). There are washrooms on site (go to the yellow building near the main entrance) and some chairs set up near the front entrance, in case you get tired in the heat and want to rest.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Izapa Ruins", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/46/f4/0a/izapa-ruins.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Highway 200", "addressLocality": "Tapachula", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "184865374": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Basic but historically interesting", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g317141-d3228491-Reviews-Izapa_Ruins-Tapachula_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/46/f4/0a/izapa-ruins.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The ruins are very basic but given the city was an extreme outpost of the Caribbean based Olmecs, its significance makes it a must-see in my mind.
