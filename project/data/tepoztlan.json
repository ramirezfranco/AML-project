In this instance, the trip is centered around a certain event, the four or five days preceding lent, known through much of the world with a Roman Catholic influence as carnaval.   \\n\\n    Back in the Land of Bobby Jindal, carnaval is known as Mardi Gras.   On both the Pacific and Gulf coasts of Mexico,  most remarkably Mazatlan and Veracruz, it bears a striking resemblance to the famous carnaval of Rio de Janiero.  Or so we are told.\\n\\n In the Mexican highlands, there is a different tradition.  Dating back 200 years, to a time when the blancos held the high hand on most of the indigenous population, some of the uppity Indians in Xochimilco took advantage of a loosening of class differences associated with carnaval.  They wore masks and poked fun at their European masters.  Over the subsequent centuries, this parody has been refined, especially in the state of Morelos, south of Mexico City, to the carnaval of the Chinelos. \\n\\n     The word chinelos is derived from a nauhatl word meaning disguise. (Nauhatl is the language of the Aztecs, which is taught and spoken among their descendents.)   There are perhaps five pueblos in Morelos  where the village revs up for carnaval with the chinelos being the focal point of the event.  Latter day Chinelos have a stylized costume comprised of a robe and a mask that imitates the European landowners of the 17th Century.   Apparently these guys wore colorful capes, pointy beards and tall hats in the shape of an inverted cone.\\n\\n     Being a literary fellow, my preparation began with a book, specifically the Lonely Planet guide to Mexico City, which includes outlying communities such as Cuernavaca and Tepoztlan.   Published in 2008, each year it becomes a bit more out of date.  In this instance, the book suggested that the Chinelos of the outlying communities made their way into Cuernavaca during the week of carnaval, thus sparing the less adventurous traveler the trouble of going to the small, primitive villages. \\n\\n   Before accepting this premise, I attempted to verify the information.  If I truly spoke  Spanish  and was\\nOur new friends, Daira, Samara and Japhet\\n willing and able to call Mexico, I might have phoned the chamber of commerce in Cuernavaca, assuming that such exists.  As a substitute, I attempted to phone the Holiday Inn Cuernavaca using a number that I found on line.  I suspected that the guy who answered the phone at that Americanized hotel would speak English better than I spoke Spanish.  What I got was a central Holiday Inn number.  A man with a German accent was unable to connect me to the hotel, but put me on hold while he called the hotel in central Mexico and posed my question:  Does the Carnival occur in Cuernavaca and are the carnaval activities close to the hotel?  \\n\\n   After a modest hold, he returned to say that the person at the Mexican hotel said that carnaval did take place in Cuernavaca, but the activities were not walking distance to the Holiday Inn.  However, the hotel would provide transportation. He went on to say that he couldn\\u2019t understand the concierge in Cuernavaca very well, as he spoke with a Spanish accent.\\n\\n     \\u201cWhere are you located?\\u201d  I queried.  To which he replied, \\u201cI am in Delhi, sir.\\u201d\\n\\n    So at this point we had information obtained by an Indian (spots not feathers) who was taught English by someone from Germany, communicating with a man in central Mexico who might not speak English very well at all.  And most definitely not with a Hindu accent. Perfect.\\n\\n   Well, the rest is history and a couple days ago we ended up at a really nice little hotel in the historic center of Cuernavaca.  By this time we had ascertained that if carnaval was ever celebrated in Cuernavaca, that was not currently the case.  Not even to the smallest degree.  To see the Chinelos, we would have to travel to Tepoztlan, about twenty kilometros from Cuernavaca.\\n\\n    On our first day here in the City of Flowers, we visited the Museo Brady.  Robert Brady was an American artist of some considerable means.  He settled in Cuernavaca in a large home that backs on to the catedral.  He then proceeded to paint the rooms in bright colors  and fill them with art which he collected while traveling the world.  Hence, this large home has been converted into a delightfully eclectic museum.  The ante room to the master suite is the Crucifix Room, the guest bedroom is the Oriental Room., there is green bathroom full of ceramic frogs.  It goes on and on.\\n\\n     While at the Brady Museum, we met two people that provided further information about the carnaval in Tepotzlan.  The first was Sergio, a long haired artistic type who was the only person employed by the Brady Museum who spoke a word of English.  Although Sergio had never been to Tepoztlan to see the carnaval (it just didn\\u2019t interest him) he had some useful insights.  It was his impression that the carnaval would be preceded by a mass which would end at 4 PM.  Following the religious ceremony, the Indios would pour forth from the church and head to the carnaval.  If this were true, we wouldn\\u2019t need to arrive before three, with the intent of doing some sight seeing and shopping prior to the appearance of the Chinelos.\\n\\n    A short while later, Sandra cornered two charming girls for a photograph in the Oriental Room.  Their father was pleased to have them talk with us as they were learning English.   At the end of our museum tour we joined  Daria and Samara at a table in Sr. Brady\\u2019s courtyard.  The girls, remarkably poised at 7 and 9, study music, piano and flute respectively,  in addition to English and they clearly enjoyed taking pictures.  Their father, Japhet, named after Noah\\u2019s son, was well spoken and exceedingly friendly.  Although he had been to Tepoztlan, he chose not to go to the carnaval because of the associated drunken, rowdy behavior. He agreed that this was most likely to occur later in the evening.\\n\\n     In the process of settling in to our hotel, the Villa Bonito les Terasses, we met Mario, the owner and manager.  Born in Colombia, he grew up in San Francisco and Orlando.  He agreed that arriving in Tepoztlan later in the afternoon would be a good plan.  Further, he offered to drive us there and pick us up for 500 pesos.  This may sound like a lot of money, but the current exchange rate at MEX was 17.15 per USD.  One does not need to be especially skilled at arithmetic to deduce that this is less that $30.  To have this service provided by a dependable friend was almost too good to be true.  Furthermore, although he had not been to the carnaval, he was fairly certain that the proceedings would be quite safe and there was little likelihood of violence of any kind.\\n\\n   Yesterday at 2 PM we took off with Mario driving us in his comfortable Nissan Pathfinder.  By 2:40 we were in Tepoztlan, Mario driving the back streets to provide us with the best view of the piramide.  This particular piramide is about 1,000 feet up on the cliffs.  Mario invited us to wonder how the Aztecs, or more likely their minions, got the stones all the way up to the top of the mountain.  Nobody knows.\\n\\n   He dropped us off with intent of seeing us back at the entrance to the village at 7 PM.  Before starting our site seeing, we stepped into a tiny restaurant where the hostess/ chef served quessadillas for 15 pesos.  We ordered two, but before she could get them out of the pan, we heard a brass band.  We ran out into the street to see a band warming up a block up hill and a family preparing their chinelo costumes.\\n\\n   As the father donned his mask, his lovely wife was dressing their toddler.  At first the youngster didn\\'t like it, throwing off the headgear, but mama outlasted him.  As the band approached, father and son took their place behind.  Chinelos began appearing in the street.  Soon there were twenty or so behind the band, with young men holding banners leading the way.\\n\\n   At this point Sandra was befriended by a gentleman who insisted on pouring her a tequila and sprite while exhorting the joy of carnaval and los chinelos.  When it became apparent that she was associated with a certain hombre, he had his assistant pour me a tequila, as well.  We put our arms around each other and shouted,&quot;Amigos!&quot; while the redoubtable SKG took a photo from a safe distance.  No fondling these love handles tonight, bucko.     \\n\\n    Sipping on our ersatz margaritas, we walked up the street with the band and the chinelos, which every now and then absorbed a new comrade.  There were thirty or forty chinelos in front of us and then suddenly there were none.  We looked around and listened, finally hearing some band music coming from the far side of a midway.  Walking through, we came to a balcony overlooking the zocalo.  Below were gathered between 150 and 200 chinelos and four brass bands.\\n\\n    Before embarking on our journey, I had found a youtube video of the chinelos in Tepoztlan.  it showed roughly two dozen men and one child dancing a shuffling step under an awning on a dusty street.  Nothing had prepared me for this spectacle.  While the brass bands played their dancing song over and over, the chinelos hopped, shuffled and twirled.   The entire zocalo was full of them.\\n\\n     Clearly the town has grown.  Our source in the pulqueria said that there are now 20,000 potential chilenos living in the puebla magica of Tepoztlan.  Its not clear if you need to be invited to be a chileno.  I doubt that just anyone can whip up a costume and join in uninvited.  It was clear from the divisions and the bands that there were four groups, perhaps representing four parishes.  And no parish was to be outdone by the other, either in noise of their band, twirling and jiving or, especially, endurance. \\n\\n   We made our way down and took  a bunch of photos.  One might have thought that the music would stop and the party would become less organized.  But it did not.  A band might stop for a minute, but begin again\\n\\n shortly, and the chinelos danced and danced.  After about fifteen minutes,  Sandra and I took a break.  On the opposite side of the zocalo stands the catedral in a large wooded complex.  the church was not open, but the famous sign depicting the Carnaval de Teopztlan surmounted the cathedral gate.  This sign is made of attached seeds and is re-created with fresh seeds each year.  We rested, photographed the festival gate and then rejoined the dancing, which had gone on unabated.  We met an older gentleman, just donning his chinelo costume.  In by the dancing, I photographed a chinelo who had dropped out, albeit after half an hour of non-stop dancing, to share a few frosties with his friends.  \\n\\n   After about forty minutes, the ropes were let down and we were permitted to enter and dance with the chinelos.  We danced for a while, took some more pictures and retired back up onto the main street.  Food booths, novelties and midway games lined the street for its entire length.  It was barely less noisy than the zocalo.  Even some of the chinelos had had enough; we saw a few walking the street, hat and mask in hand.\\n\\n    Deciding that we had accomplished our goal, at a little after five we called Mario, who said he would pick us up in an hour.  Just as we were wondering where we might go for that period, a young man offered us a sample of pulque.  It was delicious, so we repaired into the pulqueria where we purchased a half liter of the pinon pulque.  It tasted vaguely of strawberries,  Made from agave and only slightly alcoholic, it was delicious.  and the peaceful pulqeria was the perfect spot to decompress after our dance with the chinelos.\\n\\n   On the practical side:\\n\\n1.  the residential town is greatly removed from the lower town where the festival is held.

Designed only to meet the basic needs of the friars, unlike the more expansive convents in Spain.  \\n\\nBuilt with stone and \\u2018mud\\u2019 (mixture of clay, slaked lime, volcanic sand, and nopal cactus \\u2018slime\\u2019).  Ivory color used in the background to lighten up the space.  The designs you see today are three different layers.  The first layer (mostly the black designs of kings, shields of the Dominican order, and the virgin Maria) was eventually covered with white lime then painted with red flowers or geometrical patterns.  The lime was later removed revealing the black, and a bit faded, patterns we see today.  The designs are of tempera with iron oxide (red) and mineral coal (black).  \\n\\nNo more than 3 or 4 friars ever lived here at one time.  The majesty of this convent was a response to the utopia of the founders who believed it would eventually house many friars in the future.  They taught the doctrine and did literacy work through community work.\\n\\nSome of the distinguished friars are buried in the hall they call \\u2018From the Depths\\u2019 in Latin \\u2018De Profundis\\u2026\\u2019  \\n\\nSixteen arches surround the central patio.  They used to have small walls between them to prevent access to the patio.  You can still see the outline of these walls that are no longer there.  The corridors and rooms have vaulted ceilings.  The friars entered the corridors around the patio in a counter-clockwise fashion to face each of the four altars painted at the corners.  \\n\\nThe old orchard has been turned into a secondary school.  The convent was used by the military for a while.  It was turned into a museum in 1935.  The space has a small store and photo gallery.\\n\\nA religious festival takes place here every September 8th.  It could be an interesting sight\\u2026", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ex Convento Dominico de la Natividad", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/62/a7/bc/ex-convento-dominico.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ignacio Zaragoza & Arq.

Don\\'t expect it to be filled with things to look at. The attraction is the building itself.

It\\'s cool and quiet inside, a nice break when the sun gets too hot out in the streets and you want a break from the noise of the marketplace. The building is quite large and lovely to look at. It has a peaceful atmosphere. If you know anything about the history of colonial Mexico, you\\'ll like experiencing this building. Hopefully you can find some information about it online and read about it before you go. Tepoztlan, although a small town, was of strategic importance in the 16th century and it has an interesting history, much of it connected to the church. There is no entry fee. No restaurants inside. But there is a charming small bookstore. The state of Morelos has many ex-conventos in small towns, and it\\'s worth doing the entire &quot;ruta de los conventos&quot; if you enjoy history and colonial architecture. Some of them are in remote places so you need a car to go there, but it\\'s easy to get to Tepoztlan from Cuernavaca (bus or taxi), and if you go on a Sunday when they have the big market in the street, it\\'s a very lively atmosphere.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ex Convento Dominico de la Natividad", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/62/a7/bc/ex-convento-dominico.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ignacio Zaragoza & Arq.

The pyramid itself is not big (you can see it perched on the edge of the bluff from down in the town) but the view from the site is spectacular. You walk down the craft-stall lined street leading out of the zocalo, and you begin the climb. At first it is fairly easy, with stone steps, but this gives way to climbing up over rocks, in parts with little evidence of a formed path. The last part is up steel steps through a narrow chasm (when you come to the steel steps, you know you\\'re almost there - phew!) When you come to the top of the steel steps, you are there. There is a small entrance fee, which you pay as you enter the site. You can walk along the edge of the bluff, and take in the spectacular views of Tepotzlan down below, and the surrounding mountains This is the best place to take photos of the pyramid, off to the right. You can climb to the top of the pyramid, where there are the remains of a temple. It took us about an hour and a half to get up, a little less coming down.\\n\\nThis seems to be a popular visit for locals - we went up on New Year\\'s Eve morning, and were amazed at the number of locals going up, so I would recommend, if you are going up in a weekend or on a public holiday, get there early.

The view is extraordinary, both to the colorful town below and of the sun-filled blue sky above. Standing atop the small temple, above the world and with majestic black birds circling overhead, you can understand why this space was considered holy and close to the heavens.\\n\\nAll that said, these are sights you need to earn to see and the hour-long, almost vertical trek up makes you pay fully for them. Prepare yourself with the following:\\n\\n* water\\n* something energy-filled to snack on\\n* a device to take pictures\\n* shoes that are both comfortable and that you can hike with\\n* 55 pesos for the entrance fee\\n* an abundance of patience\\n\\nFollowing a straight line from the historic center of town\\'s main road, you basically walk to the foot of the mountain and then climb up. And up and up. As you ascend from the road to the foot of the mountain, you\\'ll pass through a market which will be both your last chance to use the restroom and get water for the next hour of so. And you will need plenty of water to do this hike.\\n\\nThe way up is delineated by a stone path which at best are actual steps but for the majority of the hike are stones which sort of suggest a pathway. It can be hard on the knees and you can feel going up in your whole body as you try to pick out which is the best stone to step on next. The pathway is thankfully shaded by jungle trees, so you may be exhausted but at least you\\'re not being roasted by the sun as you climb.\\n\\nThis is a hike that can test your resolve, or at least it tested mine. You feel like you keep climbing but the top never comes; there are only more stones ahead. But if you persevere, and take as many rest stops as you need, you\\'ll eventually be clear of the trees. The top will be closer, but there\\'ll still be more stone steps then a metal ladder going up and then even more stone steps and then you\\'re there: at the small rest area before the ticket table/tent where you can catch your breath along with everyone else who made the hike. (And take a moment to consider the people who work there who have to trek up and down every day)\\n\\nTickets as of November 2018 are 55 pesos, and you can choose not to purchase one if you\\'re just there for the view. But if you\\'ve just spent an hour climbing straight up, scrambling up stones through a jungle, you might as well see the temple.\\n\\nThe temple Tepozteco itself is small compared to what you can find in other areas, and time and history have stripped it down to its most basic structure. But the view is stunning and a well-earned reward for your hard work up. \\n\\nRemember going down is as vertical as going up, so take your time again. The market you passed on your way up will now be a welcome place to get some food and a drink (or two), though you can also find more formal places to refuel as you walk back to town.\\n\\nTepoztlan is about an hour away from Mexico City and can be reached by bus from Tasquena/Autobuses del Sur. A number of bus lines go to Tepoztlan on the way to another stop. From the tiny Tepoztlan bus station you can catch a taxi into town. Total transportation costs for me as of November 2018 were:\\n\\n* 10 pesos to/from Tasquena on the 2 metro line\\n* 269 pesos roundtrip bus to/from Tepoztlan\\n* 40 pesos taxi to town from bus station\\n* 35 pesos taxi back to bus station\\n\\nThis, plus the temple entrance fee, comes to about $22 USD.

Please disregard all the reviews that say this trip is not worth it because you have to walk a lot or the building at the top is very small and they were expecting something more. Having said this, allow me to explain what the Tepozteco is and what will you find.\\nThe Tepozteco is a hill located in the town of Tepoztl\\u00e1n in Morelos state. At the top of it there is a small temple constructed to honour a minor god called Ometochtli the god of pulque, which name translates to \\u201c2 rabbits\\u201d. \\nThe temple is a very small construction, the roof is gone and you will barely see some glyphs on the interior walls (please see the pictures for reference). \\nIf you\\u2019re lucky enough, you\\u2019ll find coatis at the top of the hill, a raccoon kind of mammal, I did not see any of them, I think because I hiked at noon, and the weather was very hot.\\nBesides the temple and the local fauna, you\\u2019ll have an amazing view of Tepoztl\\u00e1n from the top of the hill.\\nTo get there you will walk uphill following a stone stair. The path is very well delimited so you just need to follow it. It will take you like one and a half hour to get to the top (more or less). At the end of the road you will need to pay $55 pesos (around 3 dollars) to enter to the archeological site, except on Sundays, when the access is free. Be prepared because they only accept cash.\\nYou will be walking uphill for at least an hour so remember to bring enough water, confortable shoes, and sunscreen. The path is covered with trees that provide shadow during the walk, however at the top there are just a few places to take cover from the sun. It is also recommended to start the walk early in the morning, to avoid the hot weather at noon.\\nRemember how I started my review? If you do not like long walks, or you are expecting to see a huge ancient city, it is very likely  you will be disappointed of what you will find when you get to the top of the Tepozteco hill, that does not mean the place sucks or is not worth it. On the other hand, if you decide to give it a try your rewards will be a good hike, a great view, ancient ruins and with a bit luck, some local fauna.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Tepozteco", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/78/aa/eb/tempel-van-tepoztlan.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Tepoztlan", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "566162212": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A rewarding hiking experience", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g616313-d777764-Reviews-Tepozteco-Tepoztlan_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/78/aa/eb/tempel-van-tepoztlan.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Climbing the Tepozteco is a rewarding spiritual and mental experienc.

Unfortunately due to September\\u2019s earthquake the actual entry to the temple was closed (you can climb all the way up but once you get to the base of the rock which the temple sits atop of, a high, gated fence stops you from going any further). My friend and I were lucky enough that at the same time we reached the furthest point a legitimate tour guide was there offering to take us to a different point in the mountain which actually looks back on the temple. Francisco (contact details on picture attached) was our terrific guide and explained the meaning and the past in so much detail. The final point was higher than the actual temple and provided a magnificent 360 degree view of the region. It was such a beautiful day we could even see the volcano at Puebla. I would strongly recommend Francisco\\u2019s services to anybody. He does not speak any English though which might hinder people who don\\u2019t speak Spanish.

The base of this pyramid is at the top of a steep climb from Tepotzlan. Tepotzlan is easily accessible by bus and the climb is a short walk from the town center. You can\\'t miss it --as you walk through town you will see it looming above you.\\n\\nThis is a very steep climb, much of it made of small stairs. You know your own abilities so you know if you can do the climb, bring a child with you, etc. You will find people carrying babies and those from the cities dressed up in pretty clothes. Those of us who are less hardy need hiking shoes or solid sneakers and comfy clothes. \\n\\nA few pieces of advice: a) it is very crowded on the weekend, and the more crowded, the more difficult the climb as you\\'ll have to go at other people\\'s pace.  b) Use the bathroom before you climb :).\\n\\nc) Bring water but do not bring flavored drinks, food, gum, dog treats (yes, a friend of mine had dog treats in her bag!) because as you\\'ll see in one of the photos, there are badgers at the top who will get into your pack and will find whatever you brought even if you do not turn your back on your bag for a moment.  \\n\\nTo get to the archeological site, you will pay a small fee at the top -- at the time of my visit it was something like $50 Pesos, or ~$3USD. It is worth it. \\n\\nWe were lucky to have arrived just as a professional guide was setting up incense, blowing a conch and praying. When he completed these rituals, he gave a talk about the history and culture of the area.

On Sundays, they do not charge an entrance fee. Hence, the climb was extremely crowded - as in there were hundreds of people ahead of us and behind us the entire time. I would strongly suggest that to enjoy the most out of this hike, which climbs up a beautiful, wooded area and ends in ruins overlooking the town of Tepotzlan, to go on a different day of the week, preferably earlier in the morning.\\n\\nGETTING THERE:\\nGetting to Tepozteco is very easy from Mexico City. You can take an uber to the bus terminal in Taxqueno and take a Pullman bus straight to Tepotzlan. The bus ride takes about an hour and a half. You can buy the tickets online or buy them in person at the bus stop. You could also try to take a cab or Uber from the city; while we did not end up using this option, when I requested a fare estimate it was projected to be about ~700 pesos. You can also take a bus to the town of Cuernavaca if you want; it\\'s a popular place to visit along with Tepotzlan/Tezpoteco. However, to get from Cuernavaca to Tepotzlan, you will have to ride another bus or take a cab (about ~45-50 min drive). \\n\\nOnce you arrive in Tepotzlan, it is a very small town with a long main road called 5th Avenue that leads up right to the base of the Tepozteco. \\n\\nCLIMBING TEPOZTECO:\\nLeading up to Tepozteco there are dozens of food stands and other carts selling trinkets. Once you pass these many tents, you get to the base of the climb. The climb is very steep and often slippery. Wear comfortable shoes such as sneakers or hiking boots. The climb is up some carved stairs and mostly rocks. The climb up takes about an hour to an hour and a half. The end of the climb is some ancient ruins which you can also climb up and take in the views of the surrounding mountains and town. The climb down is tough on your knees and ankles - be careful and make sure you have steady footing as you make your way down. \\n\\nMake sure to bring enough water to drink. There are no bathrooms anywhere on the trail so make sure to use one of the restrooms in town before you climb. There are many stores offering use of their bathroom for ~5 pesos. \\n\\nIN THE TOWN:\\nIn Tepotzlan, there are many little restaurants and stores. We ate lunch at El Chinelo, on 5th Ave. They serve hearty Mexican fare; we had chicken mole and breaded steak. There is also a very popular ice cream place, called Teponieves, which serves hundreds of flavors of ice creams. The flavors are mostly fruity and some are quite exotic. You order your vessel first (cone, cup, etc.) then you go to the flavors counter and get your flavors. \\n\\nLEAVING TEPOZTECO:\\nThis was the most stressful part of our trip. You get a cab from Tezpotlan to the bus station, which should take 5-10 minutes and cost 30 pesos. At the bus station, buy your tickets for back to Mexico City. The buses do not always run on time; our bus was quite late and there was lots of traffic getting back into the city as well, so we did not get back until late. Keep this in mind as you are deciding when you want to get back to Mexico City.

It consists of a small temple to the Aztec god Tepoztecatl, a god of the alcoholic pulque beverage.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Tepozteco", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/78/aa/eb/tempel-van-tepoztlan.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Tepoztlan", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "345480952": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Tough hike, but worth it!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g616313-d777764-Reviews-Tepozteco-Tepoztlan_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/78/aa/eb/tempel-van-tepoztlan.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I was definitely humbled on out clime to Tepozteco today, much more difficult of a hike than I expected.

This was one of my favorites. \\n\\nPROs:\\n- adventurous, albeit strenuous, hike\\n- clear-cut path, stone steps and step-like stones of various shapes and sizes\\n- Not as crowded as Coba in Tulum, Teotehuacan near Mexico City, or Machu Picchu in Peru.\\n- Most people hike around the same pace, but will move aside for those who are faster\\n- entire hike is shaded by trees, which you will appreciate greatly as you huff and puff up the mountain\\n- a cool, fresh air can be felt from a nearby stream\\n- do-able hike - I\\'m not a fan of hiking, but made it up in an hour and a half at a slow, steady pace with 3 or 4 few-minute breaks. I saw people of all ages (and footwear) climbing. Tennis shoes would be wise.\\n- I believe I saw bathrooms at the top\\n- obviously, the view from the top is the highlight\\n- tropical raccoon families will greet you along the last leg of the trail and are everywhere at the top. They are quite bold and while they did not bite, they growled angrily if not given more food. Please don\\'t feed them. \\n- you can sit along the edge of the pyramid and enjoy the view / take pictures (there is a fee of 43 pesos / $3.50 US )\\n- spend time in town after the hike. The convent is worth a quick look, and the market has really good, interesting food. \\n- only 25 or so minutes outside of Cuernavaca\\n-Many buses go there and there\\'s a bus stop there with buses to bring you back to town. The price is like...17 pesos ($1.50) each way.\\n\\nCONS:\\n - the climb is strenuous for un-seasoned hikers. Just climb slowly and take breaks. \\n- you will sweat a lot (from the hike and the warmth). Obviously, an earlier start is preferable. I hiked mid-day from 12 to 3 and it was only the first half of the hike that I was drenched.

The temple which resembles the top part of a pyramid is built on top of one of the peaks of the Sierra de Tepoztlan, overlooking the valley of Tepoztlan.\\nThe pyramid is at approximately 2150 meters (7054 ft.) above sea level and at an altitude 400 meters (1,300 ft.) higher than the city of Tepoztlan; It takes approximately an hour to reach the top of the pyramid on foot; the path that leads the top of the pyramid is paved with river and quarry stones.

It consists of a 6.4-meter-high platform supporting a 3.3-meter-high temple base. Upon this stand the remains of the temple building, the remains of which now stand 2.7 meters high.[1] The temple was formed of two rooms. The first room opened onto the temple stairs, with two pillars flanking the entrance. In the centre of this room a small hollow was found, containing traces of charcoal and copal.\\nThe entry to the small inner sanctum was also flanked by two pillars. The sculpture of Tepoztecatl was probably kept in this room. (Wikipedia)\\n\\n4-There is only the temple but there are glyphs that make this site important. It was built between 1150 and  1350 before Christ. It is 600 meters up from the pueblo.\\nNote: There were several persons that I didnt think could possibly make it.

Once back at LVB, we went to work and made ceviche, salsa, mole, arroz, pozole, roasted zucchini with melted cheese and flan for dessert.\\nIt was a mesmerizing experience because Ana works with no recipes and instructs us in a very non-intimating instructional style.   Everyone was helping in the open air kitchen, eating, laughing, drinking and enjoying each others company while we were at work cooking.  I was a little nervous about not remembering all the techniques but she shared all the recipes with group so we can make at home.  Since returning, I\\'ve made many of the same recipes (with the exception of her mole, which I don\\'t think can ever be replicated since it was the most unbelievably delicious  mole I\\'ve ever had and had at least 50+ ingredients in it which is a feat in and of itself).   I am a Mexican-American and learned so much about cooking Mexican food and have impressed so many of my friends and family on my new cooking skills.

We had two extra days to explore the village and nearby Cuernavaca.  Ana speaks beautiful English so language was not a problem.  The staff was courteous and helpful and Mojo their dog was a friendly addition.

Avoid climbing it with rainy weather, it gets very slippery and dangerous. Bring a bottle of water for each, you can only buy it at the bottom or at the top of the mountain. Don\\'t bring a lot of things, try to walk light. Bring sunscreen and a cap and try to climb it early (8-9am), after that it gets very hot and very crowded and you will have to wait for people to climb or to go down and that is not fun at all.

But do contribute because once you climb the small pyramid, you feel your body filling up with energy and replenishing itself.  the views of the town and mountains are phenomenal.  There is even a little store up there- yup they have to follow the same route to bring up their supplies, quite remarkable.  You will most likely see some &quot;tejones&quot;  - raccoon looking like animals more interested in food than us...unless you have food to offer.
