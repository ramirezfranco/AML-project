I followed up regularly for months, and the gallery manager kept telling me it was &quot;en route.&quot; After 6 months they said they lost it, and the artist was going to remake the painting.

I didn\\'t see this variety even in Tequila. Equally outstanding are the candies; a fabulous selection and very thoughtful range of sizes. You can get just a small treat or pre-packaged size for the whole house. The arrayan jellies and a wonderful local treat to try, with natural tartness. Hubby\\'s favorite is the tamarind with chile.  Buy all you think you\\'ll need for yourselves and souvenirs. Then pick up 1/2 dozen or more small bags of sweets for all the souvenirs you\\'ll wish you brought back. Not expensive and so nice to share something so local.

I have been to Tlaquepaque many times, having gone with family that lives there only to shop &amp; walk around (and of course listen to Mariachis, drink, and eat). When I told them I was planning on doing a food tour they were very suspicious of it and very much against it. Apparently food tours aren\\'t as well known there as they are here in NYC. After much push back (and believe me there was quite a bit), my brother, his girlfriend, my husband, and I met with Amaya for our tour. There was a sanitation workers strike, so the otherwise picturesque main street of Tlaquepaque was blocked by very fragrant garbage trucks..our poor guide Amaya felt so bad about it but we\\'re from NYC and used to worse smells! LOL It didn\\'t bother us in the least nor did the manifestations at the government building. For us, this was just a new experience and we were happy to be a part of it. \\n\\nSo let\\'s get down to business... 8 tastings &amp; 9 different locations visited! We ate a lot! And did I mention that beverages were also included? YES! To preserve the intellectual property of the tour, I won\\'t name every place we went to because you definitely have to experience it for yourself. Amaya did a beautiful job of planning this itinerary that weaved us through the streets of Tlaqupaque, balancing out food and drink tastings artfully, all the while giving us history of the area. We talked about art, architecture, and of course the politics of food culture in Mexico. We visited a market to learn more about traditional ingredients in Mexican cuisine and boy did we learn new stuff! Having grown up with a big Mexican influence, it was great being able to learn new things and learn more about my heritage. Our first tasting was the way every tasting should start.. tacos &amp; tequila! Ok, it wasn\\'t straight tequila, it was a drink called a &quot;casuela&quot; and it is literally a bowl of grapefruit soda, grapefruits, limes, oranges, and a fruit called lima with salt and the &quot;optional&quot; shot of tequila on the side to add to it. Uhm, tequila is not optional in our family... so we poured the entire shot in the bowl.. yes, at 11:30am. It\\'s 5 o\\'clock somewhere right? Again, having been to Mexico before I had never seen this drink and was very happy to have discovered it. The taco de birria (or shredded goat stew) was tasty and like all the other servings, sauces-spicy and not- are served on the side so that each person can gauge what is best for them. This place offered seating, bathrooms, and you are there for a good amount of time. \\n\\nOur next tasting led us to a &quot;neveria&quot; or an ice cream shop where we tried something else I had never tried before, called &quot;tejuino&quot; which is lime sherbert mixed with water, ground corn, and salt.  It is definitely an acquired taste but if you like salty and sour then this is for you. \\n\\nFrom here we moved on and talked history and art, slowly walking through the streets of Tlaquepaque, never feeling rushed. Amaya was so patient with us stopping to take pictures even though we were on a food schedule &amp; had places to be. \\n\\nThe next tasting was also one I had never had but had always wanted to. This tasting was an actual full portion and I wanted more after I was done. The &quot;chile en nogada&quot; was hands down one of my favorite tastings on this tour. It was the perfect balance of sweet and salty with some nuttiness thrown in for good texture. Delicious! Again, here is another opportunity to sit, relax, and use the restroom. Oh and we also had a drink here  called &quot;horchata rosada&quot; which was made with coconut milk &amp; grendadine... usually not an horchata fan but this one turned me into one. This is a pretty filling tasting and it\\'s only #3 so what better way to digest and make room for more than by sipping on some tequilas somewhere else! We sampled a variety of tequilas and liqueurs (I did tell you we don\\'t shy away from drinking) and again Amaya was incredibly patient while some of us shopped and the rest of us drank. ;) \\n\\nOur next tasting led us to yet another item I had never tried before, the &quot;torta ahogada&quot;. This literally translates into drowned sandwich so the idea is to drown your sandwich in the tomato sauce and spicy sauce provided. Of course the sauces were on the side and you can either dip the sandwich in them or pour them over it. I tried the dipping method, but let\\'s face it, i like to get messy so I poured the sauce all over and yes it was indeed messy! But totally worth it. I would do it again and again. We also had a delicious agua fresca made with mint and lime juice and of course water. \\nYet another chance to sit, relax, and use the restroom. \\n\\nAlready filling up, onward we went to an artisanal choclaterie where we tasted a beverage called &quot;tascalate&quot; made with cacao, corn, water, annatto, and some other ingredients I can\\'t recall. This was a lovely little drink. And the best part was not one person in my extended family had heard of it and now want to go try it! HA! We also sampled tasty chocolates here as well. \\n\\nAlmost done with the tour, we still had a couple of places to visit. And so we went to another place to try Mexico City style quesadillas with a mixed berry margarita &amp; finally to a tradtional candy shop selling home made candies, Mexican egg nog &quot;rompope&quot; and so much more. \\n\\nOverall we had the best time with Amaya. As a guide she is very knowledgable, friendly, patient... everything you want a guide to be. It felt as if we were hanging out with a friend instead of a tour guide. It is very clear that she has a huge love and passion for Tlaquepaque and for guiding overall. \\n\\nNote: What I have not said is that I am a NYC food tour guide and went on this tour 1. because I am a foodie 2. because I wanted to learn more about Tlaquepaque from someone other than my family 3. because I wanted to see how other guides work. I did in fact mention to Amaya at the end of the tour that I was a guide for full disclosure. As a guide, I can recognize when someone is working just to make money and when someone is doing this because they thrive from it and love it. Amaya very clearly thrives from it and loves what she does. I would take her tour(s) again and seeing her in action made me realize why I do what I do. So thank you Amaya for a wonderful time and for reminding me that the places where we live and come from should be shared with others with lots of love.

It\\'s well worth the effort to visit. You\\'ll find upscale jewelers and trendy home goods as well as larger than life religious statuary. High quality leather, crafts, glassware, and metalworking shops abound. We found shopkeepers to be friendly, helpful, and willing to go the extra mile to accommodate packaging for travelers on delicate items. We saw a pharmacy and urgent clinic. Most of our group was English speaking but had only minimal language issues. Cash currency is pesos denomination with ample credit card acceptance. There is a bank in the district but I didn\\'t research whether they exchanged US dollars. We exchanged at the airport.\\n    It\\'s part of a district that includes museums, historic cathedrals and government agencies. Charming boutique hotels and B&amp;Bs are within easy walking distance. There\\'s something for everyone. \\n    My group of 5 spent 2 days in the district with family and friends while we previewed the area to plan a destination wedding for 75-100 guests. We sampled several restaurants with consistent high quality. Italian food and pizza were available along with sandwiches andok traditional Mexican options.\\n      There were some individual street performers and we saw flaminco dancers with live mariachi band at a venue at scheduled times.\\n      Our wedding guests will have a couple of hours free on each of two days to tourist and explore. We found a Starbuck\\'s, a sports pub, microbrewery, ice cream shop easily. Our guests will have no problem finding interesting ways to fill time that\\'s outside our function schedule.\\n       It was my first visit to Guadalajara. This district is clean and well populated without being crowded. I had no concerns for personal safety in our small group and feel comfortable that our guests will have a similar experience. We saw police patrols both walking and driving, but it was not any more than I\\'d encounter in my home community. We did see officers with semi automatic wespons and saw one K-9 patrol. Members of our group have lived in the area for many years so we\\'re confident that this is the norm here. \\n        Once you venture off Independencia, the streets in the district have narrow sidewalks with telephone poles in the middle. This prohibits wheelchair access. The side streets are narrow cobblestone paved one way streets for traffic. There is frequently one lane of parked vehicles and one lane moving. The drivers are in a rush to get through. You\\'re not taking your life in your hands, but caution is needed. \\n        I won\\'t spoil the surprise, but you\\'ll find a Guinness Book of World Records location during your visit to this district.

I replied that I do not know since I am a visitor from Cd. Juarez. Once on the bus which only cost 7 pesos, I was on my way here. Another lady who was sitting down told me which corner to get out.

Plus most of this stuff is lower priced in my hometown of Cd. Juarez, Chihuahua. However, I stopped at a shop that sold ceramic stuff..It was so cute. The lady told me that the merchandise was made by the artesans here in Tlaquepaque. I could not resist the small cactus and locket I bought. She took a long time to wrap it, but that is ok. It is going to be transported back to Cd. Juarez on a plane. I noticed no 2 items were alike.\\n\\nI also visited a couple of churches, but not any restaurants cuz I was full from eating at the Mercado. I did get a cup of coffee at the OK coffee shop.

If you are setting off from Guadalajara, Bus 275B, 275 Diagonal or TUR marked \\u2018Tlaquepaque\\u2019 at Av 16 de Septiembre and Madero. To return to Guadalajara, take the bus opposite where you stop and look out for the signboard \\'Centro\\'. Bus trip will take about 30 - 45 mins each way.\\n\\nIf you are not sure where to stop, just stop where everybody gets off or gets off one stop after the university students.\\n\\n- WOW! If you are into ceramic or clay pot or artistic painting kind of stuff, this is the town you should visit. I am not someone who is interested in artistic pieces or ceramic pottery but this town blown me away! Even the prices are reasonable, not too expensive at all. I even saw a very old vintage Singer Sewing Machine selling for only $300. I trust if this item is sold in America, it would be 10 times the price.\\n\\n- The ceramic collection is tremendous, it will take you a whole day too walk around the shops and find the best bargain.\\n\\n- Remember to bring sunscreen or a heat because there is not many sheltered walkway.\\n\\n- Food are quite pricey at Tlaquepaque so make sure you go there with a full tummy. \\n\\nIf you think my reviews have been helpful to you, please click \\'Yes\\' for \\'Was this review helpful?\\'", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Independencia Avenue", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/fe/c8/bd/pedestrian-street-of.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Tlaquepaque", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "250537286": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Shop, shop, shop", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g659617-d7262862-Reviews-Independencia_Avenue-Tlaquepaque_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/fe/c8/bd/pedestrian-street-of.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Lots of shops and historical sites.
