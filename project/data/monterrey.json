The group was too large I think, would be nicer of maybe 15 to 20 but we were about 40+. Before you go up or come down be sure to head to the little museum in the very back after all the shops. Gives great explanation and a few mock ups in English. Restrooms in the furthest back by there were clean and no wait. Also play ground for kids. The snacks area is covered and nice but the snacks selection not so great. Only thing we liked was the lemonade.

We managed to squeeze in near a large tree.  The hike to the entrance was a bit steep which presented a bit of a problem for one of our number who has had some problems with his knees and hips.

I come every time I visit and am surprised at how well it is kept up. \\n\\nPark: on the street near entrance for free and pay $20 pesos to enter walking or drive in and park at one of many small parking lots off the road. It\\u2019s $110 pesos to drive in your car which also covers everyone in it. CASH ONLY \\n\\nBring water, fruit snacks, etc because you can easily spend several hours hiking the trails. You are more likely to see animals the higher you go up. I haven\\u2019t heard of bear attacks but black bears are native to the area. I\\u2019ve heard them on previous trips and even spotted one once so it\\u2019s probably not a bad idea to bring bear mace. \\n\\nThe trails are not difficult it you\\u2019re not in terrible shape. When younger (20\\u2019s) and in excellent shape I would run/race my uncle to the top who would bike on the road. Nowadays I can easily walk up at a brisk pace and run down. This year I carried our infant son in one of those front carry baby packs, had a backpack with water, food and basic supplies and also carried our two year old daughter for most of the hike. The extra ~40 lbs wore me out and required me to sit down and take extra breaks. \\n\\nSome of my friends will think I\\u2019m crazy for taking such little ones on this trip but I\\u2019d say it\\u2019s perfect for most kids ages 5 and up and a little adventurous for anyone younger.

You\\'ll fall in love with foresty-nature! At the end of &quot;El Pinal&quot; trail is the forest Ranger look-out, getting here is a challenge for the exercise handicapped.

We took a cab and had him drop us off at the entrance to the park. There is a hotel at the top that you can go to but we wanted to start at the bottom. It was easy to get there. Getting back might be a problem. But I\\'ll get to that. We spent 4.5 hours walking the winding street and trails up the mountain. It is a moderate hike. You start out below the clouds. We went for Thanksgiving and it was very humid but a comfortable temperature. Because of the humidity some of the rocks on the ground get slippery. I wore my basic athletic tennis shoes. There were some parts I would have liked to have my hiking shoes but I managed without them just fine. My shoes kept caking up with thick clay mud, then you come to a steep incline with smooth rocks. It was hard to get traction sometimes. But again, I managed. You hike and hike then you get stuck in the cloud coverage. You can\\'t see the views at all but it is very green and pretty in that area. It is obvious there is regular high humidity cloud coverage at that altitude all the time because of how mossy and green EVERYTHING was. I joked that I felt like we were in Portland. Anyway, you walk in the fog and clouds for quite some time then when you start to get tired of walking you make it to the top above the cloud coverage. It is worth it. DO IT! And know that it will take up your morning and afternoon to explore. We walked and walked our way down back to the bottom where the entrance was with no idea how we were going to get back. Cabs are not allowed to actually pick you up in the park. We basically just exited the park and started walking away. About 10 minutes later a cab saw us and asked if we wanted a ride and we hopped in. If you bought international cell coverage and could use your phone for Uber or a cab it wouldn\\'t be a problem but we didn\\'t. So we just got lucky to have a cab go past us. I assume a lot of tourists go there so waiting for a cab probably isn\\'t that big of a deal. $450 pesos for the cab ride from Chipuque to our hotel (Barrio Antiguo). \\n\\nYou want to have good tennis shoes at least and or maybe trail shoes.

The city is surrounded by them. The city\\'s elevation is around 2,000 ft., and Chipinque\\'s highest peak, El Copete de las Aguilas or simply El Copete, stands at 7,300 ft. The Park (it is a National Park) is full of options, either for top athletes and as well as for the average person.\\n\\nWhen you arrive at the Park there is a booth (2,900 ft.). You may either park outside and walking in is cheaper, or you can bring your car inside the Park. 50 yards after the checkpoint, to the left is the Visitor\\'s Center (CAV), open from 9:00 to 6:00 daily, where you can snack and get info and maps. There is a 7 km very winding paved road that will take you to the Meseta (4,300 ft), next to the hotel entrance. The driving is scenic, with views of the city. The hotel is not part of the park but the views from there are very good.\\n\\nIf you rather walk or hike, there are plenty of options. You can simply walk up the paved road, carefully, because there is traffic. When taking trails, make sure you know where you are going. Get a map or ask the park people. Road signs are decent, but you can get lost. There are plenty of trails with different grades of difficulty, for hiking, biking or mountain biking. If you want to bike you have to bring your own bike and buy a license plate (around $10).\\n\\nFor regular hiking, my favorite is La Brecha del Chile trail, about a 1,000 ft hike over a mile long. Another option is driving up to Km. 5, what is called Canoas, and take Las Moras , a very flat, shady and somewhat longer trail. If you drive up to La Meseta, you have several very nice options. The road to El Pinar (5,000 ft), taken from here, is a 2 to 4 hour hike. El Tubo Enterrado is another good option. There are other shorter hikes. \\n\\nFor serious hiking to the 3 main peaks: El Copete (7,500 ft, 6-8 hours), La Ventana ( 6,200 ft, 4-6 hours) or La M (6,660 ft, 5-7 hours) you need a permit (3-4 days in advance) and a guide (can be provided by the park). There is a stop before La Ventana called Las Antenas, which is a shorter option with the same spectacular view. You usually depart from La Meseta at 4,300 ft. The views of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains is breathtaking. \\n\\nAnother option is just finding a Picnic spot, of which there are several along the paved road and enjoying the view.

It is a steep winding drive, but the views of the city and the nearby neighborhood  (which reportedly includes some of the most exclusive property in Latin America) are excellent. Monterrey is in a beautiful setting. The park was heavily used when we were there - full of walkers, cyclists, runners and families with the kids playing in the park playgrounds. To get the feel of an &quot;ecological park&quot; you have to get away from the crowds by getting onto one of the trails that branch off from the main road. Some of the trails allow bikes and some just hikers.  There is a small nature museum near the entrance which is informative and entertaining for the kids. We were looking for birds in the park and the two most active areas were in the busy playground picnic area at the end of the road (Mexican Jay, Hepatic Tanager and Black-crested Titmouse) and in the pine forest (including Pine Flycatcher) on one of the side trails. We saw several raptors, including Golden Eagle soaring over. Several species of butterflies were out, even though winter is not the best time for butterflies. We\\'d like to return and try cycling or walking to the end of the road. An easy must-visit for the visitor as well as the resident of Monterrey.

The paths from Fundidora to the museums is beautiful, all green and full of birds, very well maintained with a lot of security and clean. Jogging alongside the water canal was energizing, there is low volume music and several nice fountains and sightseeing points in the approximately 2.5 kilometers of travel.\\nNow I think I am going to do this path more often, I think it is a great option if you are staying in the Fundidora area or the Macro Plaza area. Great for an early morning run, while the temperature is not too high. Actually for walking or jogging I will recommend visiting the Paseo Santa Lucia early in the morning or at sunset to enjoy the place.

We were not interested in the return trip since that would consume too much time out of our day. We had very limited time in the city and wanted to get off downtown and keep going. The guy refused to even let us buy a seat for the cart so we were very disappointed and asked for our money back. Thankfully they did return all of our money and had to go a different route. So beware if you have children, these people do not let on board any kind of carts except wheelchairs. There is a space next to the line where people park their strollers and get them on the way back.

I can\\'t say enought about how well run and maintained this riverwalk is. The water is clear like a swimming pool and all along the way is interesting artwork / murals, water featrues, and landscaping.  We took the boat from Fundidora, got off at the Macroplaza for an couple hours to walk around and shop, and then rode the boat back. There is a small gift shop and nice public restroom at the Macroplaza stop. It\\'s also &quot;underground&quot; so it\\'s shaded. The boats are covered and the breeze from riding the boat is wonderful on a hot day. It was near 100 degrees Farenheit the day we rode. There is one Bar/restaurant along the riverwalk. I would have rated this attaction Excellent if there were more dining / shopping options along the riverwalk itself. The walk would be well worth it even without those things and of course it doesn\\'t detract from the boat ride.

That is ALL my daughter wanted to do while our visit in Monterrey.\\nWe went in June, it was hot and humid.  The place is HUGE!!!, but the layout and just about everything else could be so much better.\\nNot a lot of shade to get from one exhibit to another. The displays themselves could be a lot better! i.e. the ARCTIC display was a small room (with a/c, so that was nice) where they play you a 5 minute movie about the Arctic (in Spanish), then you walk into this mini (and I mean mini) showcase of a mannequin dressed in Arctic attire, a stuffed polar bear and a robotic Abominable Snow Man to give the kids just enough of a scare, they wont want to go into any other display.... let\\'s see, the film was educational I guess, the polar bear was a good picture op, and then Yeti... I don\\'t see the educational or entertainment value.  All this at an extra cost of course.\\nThe safari tram was cool, although we got on a bus with the noisiest family reunion... they were noisy, and kept throwing trash out the sides (disgusting), the driver never once said to stop, or to be quiet or anything.  In fact, our tour was cut short because he just wanted to get those people out of there.  The camels and ostriches are VERY aggressive when getting food, so not so good for little kids.  They let you out at a giraffe enclosure and you can feed them easy, kids like it.\\nDinosaur exhibit was cool and different.  \\n\\nThey have animals you can take your picture with for an extra cost.  These are wild animals who do NOT want to be there posing for tourists.  The lion cub was VERY unhappy, she did NOT want to be there, kept growling and kept trying to swat and bite (she took a swing at my nephew (scratched his cheek), they yelled at my nephew for getting too close, he\\'s 5 and first instinct was to want to pet it. I really didn\\'t want to take pictures out of principle. \\n\\nAll in all, I would have to say, this park has a lot of work to do, improve paths (not wheelchair or mobility issues friendly AT ALL), more shaded areas, cleaner facilities, cleaner EVERYTHING.  The water areas all around (including ones for the animal) smelled like stagnant water... very sad.\\n\\nMonterrey has SO MANY COOL places, I would skip this one.

The admission prices are fare. Needs a bit of input  in terms of $$ for innovation, quality and mainly ideas because the park\\'s got great potential. Could have been a top class experience...\\n\\n-Animals: The park is in general not very clean. On one hand, we saw litter practically in every animal enclosure/cage ,which was sad. Also, It was sad to see a tiger and a lion being handled very un professionally by staff. Some animals like these, are being used to make money out of photographs. On the other hand, the animals from the Safari look very happy and healthy. Safari would be better with more animals/ more variety. (no tigers, no lions, etc)\\n\\n-Staff: In general very unprofessional, some personnel don\\'t even wear badges and uniforms so hard to tell if they can help you or not. However, most staff were kind and welcoming. Staff very unprepared for what they do and they sometimes mislead you or don\\'t know how to provide you the information. \\n\\n-Facilities: Dirty ,all in all. Rubbish/litter everywhere. Lack of good practice in handling the parks rubbish - no sustainable input, no recycling campaigns not even for educational purposes (the park is full of families with children) the park itself could be very educational... in terms of nature/animal  preservation and sustainability. They have a first aid centre, which is a must. Some attraction with no wheelchair access in general the park isn\\'t well fitted for wheelchairs or people with disability.\\n\\n-Attractions: The Dinosaur land best descriptive is : &quot;cheap&quot;.. bad quality animatronics and very unrealistic. But its got potential to be a great attraction, very nice locations. It could be a more thrilling experience if Dinosaurs and prop were more realistic and of better quality. The other attractions are fun and safe.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Bioparque Estrella", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/32/52/32/bioparque-estrella.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera a Rayones Km. 9 A 55 minutos de Monterrey", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "meuw", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "157914861": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "excellent trip with my family", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150782-d184280-Reviews-Bioparque_Estrella-Monterrey_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/32/52/32/bioparque-estrella.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "we had a great day with the family when we came here. lots of fun things to do with the kids, you can go there when they open and leave until park closes, totally recommended.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Bioparque Estrella", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/32/52/32/bioparque-estrella.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera a Rayones Km. 9 A 55 minutos de Monterrey", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "meuw", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "147606833": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Best investment in the area", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150782-d184280-Reviews-Bioparque_Estrella-Monterrey_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/32/52/32/bioparque-estrella.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The Bioparque Estrella was very fun, it has enough activities to keep your whole day full.

So much so that the 2-way street had cars parked on both sides creating a 1-way street in the middle. It made it difficult to accommodate the cars leaving the park, and thus if you plant to leave before 1 or 2 pm, my recommendation would be to part sooner and walk in so that you do not have to fight the traffic. The park \\u201ccloses\\u201d around 2pm, meaning no additional cars can come, because of the distance from gate to hiking trail. \\n\\tUpon arrival, we paid 20 pesos each to get in. No tiendas or cafeterias, just some Coke vending machines (that didnt work). Thankfully we had a bookbag and plenty of water. And thus we began our hike. The park is set up pretty simply - one nice, flat, paved path in a circle from the main entrance, probably about 2-3 km long. At the apex of the paved circular path is a single brick-layered path heading up into the mountain. This leads to the cascada (waterfall) and small river. We took this path, however ended up using the worn away dirt paths on either side, because the incline was so steep, and the bricks so worn, that we were slipping! After about 40 minutes, we reached a concrete platform. This marked about the halfway point to the Waterfall. At this point, we were pretty tired but after some convincing, we decided to finish the hike.\\n\\tThe next 40 minutes were a mixture of beauty, danger, challenge, and reward. True hiking. Steep. Tight paths, rock formation, etc. There is a small cliff about halfway up the second leg that we stopped and took a picture on- great views! You can hear the echo of the waterfall for about the last 10-12 minutes of the hike, creating excitement for your arrival! Upon arriving, the area was pretty busy with other people, all swimming and enjoying the cool, refreshing water. We dropped a towel down and enjoyed about 40 minutes of the sounds of the waterfall and feeling of the cool water on our feet and face. \\n\\tOverall the trip was about 4 hours from parking to driving away. Probably 1:45 to get to the top, 40 minutes relaxing, and 1:30 down, with break in between. I would not recommend this for someone is does not have good balance, cannot hike steep inclines, or is afraid of heights. We thoroughly enjoyed it, and will hopefully return to visit soon!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Parque Natural La Estanzuela", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/26/96/0c/parque-natural-la-estanzuela.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera Nacional entronque a Valle Alto", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "64988", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "474378144": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Best place MTY", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150782-d558772-Reviews-Parque_Natural_La_Estanzuela-Monterrey_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/26/96/0c/parque-natural-la-estanzuela.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is the best place in monterrey if you want to go for a quick getaway.

And its worth writing about! You take a freight elevator up about two thirds of the way to the top of the plant and then you take the access stairs and ladders all the way to the top. Note that you cannot access this part of the plant any other way, the \\u201croof walk\\u201d (separate tickets) which I also did, only goes up about two thirds of the way. And the view from the very top is spectacular! From there you work your way back down over a series of zip lines and rappelling drops. Its really pretty clever how they work the descents in among all the industrial equipment and the vantage points are unlike anything you will experience. I have done canopy lines in wilderness settings and they are fun and scenic. But this felt like you were in a James Bond or Jason Bourne movie, moving through the foundry. \\n\\nThe tour is very well organized. Two guides in bright orange kit you out in safety gear, explain the procedures, and escort you every step of the way. They speak English, Spanish and German so there is no loss of communication. They also had the right mix of seriousness and fun \\u2013 they would take your picture, ask if you wanted to go slow or fast, etc. But they were VERY attentive to the safety matters and I never once felt that I was at risk. Yes, it was a bit scary at times, but it was the good kind of scary that comes from a well designed activity. And like I said, it was the only way to see this part of Horno3.

It took me 3 hours to climb from Bosque de la Pastora up to the Antena. I started climbing at 9 on a Sunday morning. The first hour and a half, I really felt there were too many people, and many are climbing while listening to music on their phones (without headphones...). Many people were going down already, I think many climb up very early to enjoy sun rise and avoid high temperatures. Then you reach an large concrete floor where in most of the people will stay to have lunch or whatever. I found the second half of the walk was much better: less crowd, sometimes I was alone, but the walk is sometimes more difficult. You do sweat a lot. This can be called an easy walk because no specific equipment is required (just a good pair of trekking shoes, stones and rocks on the ground), but this is quite exhausting. The view is off course very nice, but if there are clouds like often at the top, you do not see much, just fog. The Antena spot it self is disappointing, I could not enjoy the view from there we were in a cloud passing by. There was no space there to enjoy a lunch, or else maybe you have to continue on a small path under trees that may lead somewhere but I did not take it. It took me also three hours to come back to Bosque de la Pastora where I had parked my car for free in the neighbourhood just down the Bosque de la Pastora. The Bosque de la Pastora entrance has a gate it seems only residents can drive in. But the way from the entrance of the Bosque de la Pastora to the circuit is easy to find, and lots of people wearing running shoes are on the way too.  I could see on the way a scorpio-like bug, many butterflies, black small animals hiding in the trees, this made it a good experience overall.

There is a surface parking lot and two levels of underground parking (all pay).

The visit to the furnace, it\\'s restaurant, and the museum are really worth while a visit.\\n\\nEnjoy!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Parque Fundidora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/7b/03/11/img-20170829-164325-largejpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Adolfo Prieto S/N Colonia Obrera", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "64010", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "430140679": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Love it!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150782-d184346-Reviews-Parque_Fundidora-Monterrey_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/7b/03/11/img-20170829-164325-largejpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "You can walk around because its vary safe.

It is gleaming white, with sharp soaring angles that will almost stop you in your tracks, and a wonderful location within view of the national palace and literally just steps away from Monterrey\\'s famous river walk. One side of the museum has a beautiful cascade with trees and other plantings. It\\'s a favorite spot for picture-taking (weddings and birthdays, especially girls\\' 15th) but also a nice place to cool off on a hot day or dig into a brown bag lunch. See my picture.\\n\\nA new temporary exhibit, &quot;Between Ideas and Machine Guns: 1913-1914,&quot; will run through June 29, 2014. It offers a look at social and political developments in two confused years of violent revolutionary struggle. If you\\'re interested in colorful figures like Emiliano Zapata or Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa, this is the exhibit for you. Don\\'t miss the display of Villa\\'s ornately embroidered canvas leggings, pistol and knife with beautifully decorated holster and sheath, and fancy belt. See my picture.\\n\\nA second temporary exhibit of much longer duration features Ivory religious effigies, highly decorated with handworked silver from the late 17th to the early 19th century. Whether you are religious or not, you will be thoroughly engaged by these beautiful images, many of them portraying the Virgin Mary in elaborate head dresses. They are stunning to behold. See my picture.\\n\\nThe permanent exhibits are also interesting, featuring fine examples of pre-Columbian art (many objects are delightfully anthropomorphic), a variety of historical artifacts that do a good job of telling Mexico\\'s history in all its glory and tragedy, and a display of historical paintings depicting the interesting and then thought to be &quot;scientific&quot; notions of &quot;castes&quot; or racial mixes. Properly understood now to be examples of pseudo-science, they nevertheless offer insights into Mexican identity. An English-language video  plays on a loop to help non-Spanish speaking visitors understand their significance.\\n\\nFor amenities, there\\'s a brand new book and gift shop, a snack bar on the lower level right by the river walk, and clean modern restrooms. Many days offer free entry, but the standard fee is 40 pesos, about $3 US, which gets you into this museum plus the Nuevo Leon museum connected by a glass walkway over the river walk, and also the exhibitions of the national palace across the plaza. It\\'s a bargain.\\n\\nI have been to this museum four or five times in the last several months. You can do it in a day, or even a couple hours if you\\'re pressed for time. Just don\\'t miss it. It\\'s as pleasant a spot as any in Monterrey, and it will help you understand the city, the country, and the people.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Museo de Historia Mexicana", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ca/0e/92/pesimas-condiciones-de.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Dr Coss 445 Zona Centro", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "64000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "197668005": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Impressive Display of Mexican History", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150782-d184327-Reviews-Museo_de_Historia_Mexicana-Monterrey_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ca/0e/92/pesimas-condiciones-de.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A visually appealing and informative overview of Mexican history from the first arrival of people to the 20th century, all in a large well-lighted and modern setting.

In most recent years this area was plagued by Narco traffic shootings and killings.   Unfortunately the once vibrant nightlife has disappeared and many clubs have since closed.   Even on a Saturday night only a few places remain open, but few people venture there.   Most locals will discourage tourists from visiting Bario Antiguo and the nightlife scene has moved on to other parts of the city.   At this point, it only is worth visiting during the daytime as the former nightlife is just a shadow of its former self.    This all started with a shoot-out and killing at Cafe Iguana (Another user posted a review, which indicates they have since closed).   Locals got scared and stopped coming.\\n\\nI wanted to see this for myself as it was hard to believe - I had very fond memories.   I did visit one of the few places remaining open in this area called Nueva Luna.   It had live music that started around 10:30 at night (I went on a Saturday) and drinks were cheap (30 pesos for a beer).\\n\\nHowever, if you are planning on a night out in Barrio Antiguo itself you would be better off going somewhere else.

My trip ended up lasting 3 weeks, and I must say that all of my time outside of work was spent in Barrio Antiguo area. One of the hottest disco\\'s in this area is the KokoLoco. the club is 3 floors &amp; It features 2 different dance floors, the first of which is Alternative/Rock and was the most fun for me... \\nThe 2nd and 3rd floor feature Pop &amp; Dance Music.. the third floor is a loft over looking the 2nd. Drinks are cheap here and the best night to go is Friday. If you are looking for just a simple bar, I really enjoyed the Nueva Luna. It is a resturant/bar featuring live music every night of the week. There are sooo many bars and discos in this area I have a hard time remembering all of the names but I can tell you that this is one of the hottest cities I have ever been to when it came to a weekend night life. Barrio Antiguo is definatly the place to be as it reminded me alot of Burbon Street New Orleans (with out the bad smell and dirty atmosphere) on friday and sat nights.... I have seen mention of the Blue Moon in other posts.. this too was a very nice bar to visit playing the latest in Hip-hop/rap/dance music. The Blue Moon is not in Barrio Antiguo, but is located in the Plaza area. Drinks here were also fairly cheap. For resturants, I would reccomend the following...\\n\\nLa Bikni - 5 Star resturant with all types of food &amp; featuring live music. La Bikni also features a disco on the roof featuring all types of music.\\n\\nLa Parola - 5 Star Itilan Resturant with all the trimmings. Very romantic to take your specail someone\\n\\nLa Valentina - 5 Star resturant featuring all kinds of food, but dress nice and make a reservation or you wont get in. La Valentina also features a disco (I forgot the name of the disco) with exellent music.\\n\\nBambuka - This is a Resturant/Bar/disco with a New York City atmosphere. This Resturant/Bar sits on the second floor of a building featuring indoor/outdoor dining, good music and Large Plasma screens playing music videos... Again Dress Nice and Make a reservation or you wont get in....\\n\\nAnd remember Taxi\\'s are VERY cheap in Mexico so don\\'t do anything stupid.... take a taxi to and from your hotel if you plan to go drinking... ;-) Hope this helps some of you and I hope you are able to enjoy Monterrey Mexico as much as I did...", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Barrio Antiguo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3c/b8/c2/in-the-team-building.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Padre Raymundo Jardon de Mayo 5 Zona Centro", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "64000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "1229441": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Hottest City in the world!!!!!!!!!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150782-d184276-Reviews-Barrio_Antiguo-Monterrey_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3c/b8/c2/in-the-team-building.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "If you are looking for a good time head to Monterrey,Mexico.

During both trips, we went to a great coffee place located on the main level, across from Starbucks and a popular sushi place, where I enjoyed a good cappuccino and apple strudel the first time, and then a mocha and slice of chocolate cake the second trip, fantastic! They also had soups and sandwiches and comfortable inviting terrace seating where servers bring foods out to your table for you. Oh, and there are free refills for Americanos and also for a few other coffees. \\n\\nThe parking in the garage was free both times that we went, and I love that the shopping center wasn\\'t over crowded which made it so that we could enjoy our time there much more, and we didn\\'t have long lines for anything.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Esfera Centro Comercial", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0f/67/1f/5c/photo1jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av.

The &quot;OVNI&quot; attraction is closed since my 2015 visit; this time, we also found closed the &quot;Maremoto&quot; and &quot;Trenecito&quot;. We stayed 1 hour in the line for &quot;Lanchas del Lago Contar&quot; as they had 3 boats broken and only 2 passengers were allowed per boat. Water attractions are closed at 6, the park closes at 7, even on Fridays or Saturdays; employees are rude at closing times as if they try to run away from there as soon as possible. Closed areas smelled terrible.\\n\\nFood is terrible and expensive. You will only find burgers, hot dogs and snacks. Water is also expensive, a $8 pesos bottle is sold in $25; it is not allowed to access the park with food or beverages, even water.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, they presented a show called &quot;Fiesta&quot; which was a great opportunity for the kids to be with the characters and take photos. However, the parade car looked like made by kids, not at the level it should be.\\n\\nThe park deserves a better management. There is a plaque at the entrance with the logos of 8 or 10 big companies which sponsor the park, I couldn\\'t imagine how will be the park without those funds (if they even exist).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "1"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Parque Plaza Sesamo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/ad/32/fd/img-20170105-134029-largejpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Agricola, 3700 - 1 Ote.

The museum showcases international contemporary art, with a decided emphasis on latin american artists (and not just Mexicans).\\n\\nI\\'m not always a huge fan of modern art which usually strikes me as passionless, antiseptic, and talentless. MARCO certainly has its share of exhibits that fit that stereotype, but they also have a lot of truly excellent exhibitions, like their recent perspective on the great Mexican artists of the 20th century. Even though many of the works were lesser-known works of masters like Diego Rivera and David Siguieros, they were still works of amazing depth and experience -- pieces that reflect insight and passion. I overheard one patron saying that to understand the works of people like Jose Clemente Orozco you must travel to Guadalajara and see the real master-works. There is validity to that viewpoint, but the works that MARCO displayed were still outstanding representations of the artist\\'s tremendous talent, and I was mighty glad to have had an opportunity to see so many wonderful works of the great masters in one exhibition hall.\\n\\nThank you MARCO! Your exhibition of Mexican Masters of the 20th Century was MAGNIFICENT!\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Museo de Arte Contemporaneo (MARCO)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/14/c9/4d/33/marco.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Zuazua y Ocampo Zona Centro", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "64000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "344351": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "what i think about the MARCO museum", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150782-d151189-Reviews-Museo_de_Arte_Contemporaneo_MARCO-Monterrey_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/14/c9/4d/33/marco.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I am a mexican living in Monterrey, N.L. and I love that museum. When I first went to see it and saw how great it was, I couldn\\'t help being proud of being a &quot;regia&quot;. Today, the marco museum is the best museum in Latin America. It is a very lovely place with breathtaking architecture. It has beautiful art and one gets out of the place with a happy feeling and feeling a thousand times more cult than before. It is the best museum I\\'ve ever been to and I love the place so much.

Really, it\\'s worth visiting. It has a lot of programs for poor children and poor women in Monterrey and I think that\\'s a very wonderful thing because Mexico needs more things like that.
