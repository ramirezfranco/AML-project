When I visited with my wife several years ago it was on a Saturday.  My daughters and I went on a Monday this time. It seemed more hustled and bustled, less clean and less hospitable.  But we enjoyed ourselves.  I was disappointed because the craftsmen were not working at the National Museum Of  Copper.  They are probably there on weekends and it is a very interesting demonstration.  The Museum itself is interesting with examples from the first pieces created by the Purepecha right up to recent work done by award winning national artisans.  \\n\\nIn previous trips artisans were insistent that we not only see their finished work on display for purchase, but invited us to their shop to see the works being crafted.  That did not happen this trip.  But the copper work is beautiful, and with the current exchange rate more than reasonably priced.   \\n\\nWe ate lunch at a small hotel and restaurant on the Zocalo.  We did not write down the name because we were sure we could remember it; but we do not.  The food was good, but the waiter was young and missed a few things. One of the things that distresses me most in my travels in Mexico is there are no refills on coffee.  Coffee is considered more of an after dinner drink with desert and they bring you a separate cup each time and charge you for each individually.  Some restaurants make an exception at breakfast, particularly if coffee is included in the price of the meal, but do not count on it.  It can come as a shock if you are a big coffee drinker and not aware of the practice.  \\n\\nParking is something of an issue as it is in much of Mexico.  We were able to find a place a couple of blocks from the Zocalo and go through the courtyard of the Cathedral to get there.  In addition to numerous shops around the Zocalo there are street vendors set up under the porticos around the Zocalo.

They\\'ve been making things out of copper here long before the Spanish showed up, so they know what they\\'re doing. Most of the families have been doing this for many generations. It\\'s unique in Mexico, and maybe in the world.\\n\\nNearly all of the shops surrounding the plaza sell copper items, from touristy things like key chains and so forth, to very serious cooking pots, to sinks and bathtubs. It\\'s worth spending an afternoon here and also having a meal at &quot;El Portal&quot;, right on the plaza. \\n\\nI\\'m revealing another of my little secrets by mentioning El Portal, but I doubt there\\'s any danger of them being overwhelmed with gringo tourists since nearly the entire state of Michoacan is under a US State Dept travel security alert, as in....don\\'t go anywhere except Morelia and fly directly there if you can. \\n\\nHowever, Danger is my middle name. I almost always drive in Mexico, many thousands of kms over the past 15 years, including all around Michoacan, with no problems ever. I will take the bus if I\\'m just going to a specific place and returning to D.F. but otherwise having a car is worth it for the ability to stop and check out anything and everything.\\n\\nThe word from my Mexican friends in Patzcuaro, who are maybe in the best position to know since they have lived all their lives there, is not to go down into the Tierra Caliente, but as they say..... \\'why would you want to go there anyway?\\'. So, if you\\'re contemplating a day trip to Nueva Italia, thinking perhaps the town is a reconstruction of Venice in the middle of nowhere in Mexico, I\\'ll save you the trouble. I\\'ve been there and can tell you that there are no canals with gondolas gliding quietly by, but I didn\\'t get shot at there, either. I\\'ve been way more afraid in South Central LA.\\n\\nAnyway, back to Santa Clara... if you want a copper comal, this is about the only place in the world you will find one, and they are fantastic for cooking tortillas. And further, if you want anything of copper that is made in Santa Clara, it will be at least 25% less expensive than in Patzcuaro, which is only 30 minutes away. Figure double if you buy the same items in Mexico City. And most of the really amazing things aren\\'t sold in other cities. So, for example, if a person was going to buy something pretty expensive, like a bathtub or a 500 lb. 6 foot tall urn or a set of the most beautiful heavy gauge copper cookware this side of France, it would be worth the trip here just to save a serious chunk of money. And it\\'s a really nice quiet little colonial town. \\n\\nWe came back twice in two days, just to make sure we went in every shop. There\\'s also a nice little municipal copper museum with a demonstration forge, closed on Mondays.\\nIt may be best to stay in Patzcuaro and make a day trip. I did see one hotel sign but didn\\'t check it out.\\nI\\'m not sure why another reviewer only gave it one dot, because it is worth 4. Maybe if she/he went in the evening it would be a 1 because there wouldn\\'t be anything at all to do, or maybe if the reviewer doesn\\'t like copper stuff, but during the day it\\'s definitely worth the visit for anyone with a curious streak and a free day to go there. And one of the days we went was tianguis day, so we got a little bonus.\\nVenga y disfruta", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Santa Clara del Cobre", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1e/24/35/plaza.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Patzcuaro", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "61800", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "186114349": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Worth a detour from Patzcuaro", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499420-d608247-Reviews-Santa_Clara_del_Cobre-Patzcuaro_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1e/24/35/plaza.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "After a short tour around the free museum (not especially worthwhile) I visited Casa Fel\\u00edcitas at Pino Suarez No.88 that is both a store and taller (workshop).

In Santa Clara we first saw the busy Sunday market and then we went to the Museo Nacional Del Cobre. There are all kinds of things made from copper, some as low as 10 pesos, some incredibly large pieces for about 15000 pesos: Plates, cooking utensils, sinks, table tops, decorative vases, souvenirs... and even antique looking bathtubs! Great craftsmanship! In the museum courtyard we saw several  craftsmen pounding on a piece of copper after taking it off the fire. There are other places also where you can see how copper is handcrafted, just ask the many stores around. There are other things to see in Santa Clara Del Cobre like the colonial antique portal, the solar clock from the XVIII century, etc. Coming up August 10, 2013 through the 18 is the XLVIII F\\u00e9ria Nacional Del Cobre- LXVIII Concurso Nacional de Cobre  Martillo.

I fell in love with a huge copper bathtub - but it was out of budget and too big to fit in the Cherokee. As we explored the different shops a fellow came by with a flyer inviting us to a demonstration of how they work the copper. Since it was located close by, in a shop/workshop located just up and around the corner from the main square, how could we resist?\\n\\nThe copper artisans showed us how they start with a lump of copper and by firing it and hammering it several times and using different hammers they turn that lump of copper into a glistening copper pot. Quite fascinating. They also told us that the copper mines in the area are no longer in production so they are making all new items from recycled copper. \\n\\nIf you are in the area and you like copper don\\'t miss Santa Clara del Cobre.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Santa Clara del Cobre", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1e/24/35/plaza.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Patzcuaro", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "61800", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "130439686": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A Must See &amp; Buy", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499420-d608247-Reviews-Santa_Clara_del_Cobre-Patzcuaro_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1e/24/35/plaza.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Museum should not be missed.

The start is a little rough with a rocky road climbing through a poor but friendly neighborhood. There is lots of commerce and fellow exercisers on the road to El Estribo making one feel safe. The upper part of the climb is a beautiful, tree-lined road that leads to a fabulous lookout and picnic area. A steep set of 300-400 stairs takes climbers to the very top of the volcano. However, the lookout/ gazebo area has the best view.  In our 7 days in Patzcuaro, we sweated up El Estribo 3 times and loved every 2-hour roundtrip walk.

When I visited with my wife several years ago it was on a Saturday.  My daughters and I went on a Monday this time. It seemed more hustled and bustled, less clean and less hospitable.  But we enjoyed ourselves.  I was disappointed because the craftsmen were not working at the National Museum Of  Copper.  They are probably there on weekends and it is a very interesting demonstration.  The Museum itself is interesting with examples from the first pieces created by the Purepecha right up to recent work done by award winning national artisans.  \\n\\nIn previous trips artisans were insistent that we not only see their finished work on display for purchase, but invited us to their shop to see the works being crafted.  That did not happen this trip.  But the copper work is beautiful, and with the current exchange rate more than reasonably priced.   \\n\\nWe ate lunch at a small hotel and restaurant on the Zocalo.  We did not write down the name because we were sure we could remember it; but we do not.  The food was good, but the waiter was young and missed a few things. One of the things that distresses me most in my travels in Mexico is there are no refills on coffee.  Coffee is considered more of an after dinner drink with desert and they bring you a separate cup each time and charge you for each individually.  Some restaurants make an exception at breakfast, particularly if coffee is included in the price of the meal, but do not count on it.  It can come as a shock if you are a big coffee drinker and not aware of the practice.  \\n\\nParking is something of an issue as it is in much of Mexico.  We were able to find a place a couple of blocks from the Zocalo and go through the courtyard of the Cathedral to get there.  In addition to numerous shops around the Zocalo there are street vendors set up under the porticos around the Zocalo.

You can come to enjoy a delicious ice cream at the Erendira stand on Portal Hidalgo, visit the many stores that offer the artesanias from Michoac\\u00e1n or shop the clothing and shoe stores, listen to the local musicians, or sit on a bench eating a churro or a corunda which is the Michoac\\u00e1n corn (maiz) specialty.

From the tall, statuesque trees to the newly refurbished fountains, pathways and benches, this plaza stands above all others I\\'ve seen.  Patzcuaro is fairly unique in that there are two plazas separated by 1 block that are entirely different in their character.  Plaza Grande is much larger and has a much more relaxed and laid back atmosphere than the smaller, more active Plaza Chica at the entrance to what I feel is the most amazing Mercado in all of Mexico.  Again, I\\'ve been in most of the mercados in the highlands of Central Mexico, and have yet to see one more charming and active than the one in Patzcuaro, which really doesn\\'t make sense given the size of Patzcuaro compared to the other cities.  I\\'ve lived here 8 years, and there are still places in this huge market that I\\'ve never been to.  There is never a dull moment is this bustling little commercial center of the area.  Sorry to stray from the original subject, but I wanted to give the overall Centro area the credit it deserves.

Absolutely not. We paid 70 pesos each and waited for 30 minutes before the boat left the harbour. The 40 minute ride was great across the muddy lake. Lots of Pelicans and other birds to watch along with the island getting closer. A group of musicians serenaded us on the way. At the island it was obvious the huge statue of Morelos was on the top. It is a steep climb with many stairs but there is a lot to see and many shops and restaurants to look at while you rest. It took us 30 minutes to climb only because we were with an older couple who had to stop and rest a lot, probably would take 15 minutes. At the top there is a 10 peso fee each to enter the monument site but it is well worth it as the statue is 40 meters high and inside is a marvellous museum. There are flights of stairs which wind inside the statue to the top viewing area. Along the walls are murals depicting the history of Mexico and the life of Mexican hero Jose Maria Morelos y Pavon. Not a happy story as with most Mexican history lessons, the Spanish were brutal to the indigenous people. The view at the top is a marvellous 360 degrees. After leaving the monument there are the stairs back down through the town, with many tempting stores and restaurants who display the food items attractively. The streets were clean, washed and with no smell. We stopped off on the left path to see the cemetery. I was thrilled to find a thread store at the bottom by the dock and bano\\'s so I was able to buy embroidery thread for a piece I am working on. A lot of shops specialize in brightly embroidered or cross stitched blouses and dresses, very good designs and quality. The boat was waiting at the dock so we hopped on, left immediately and again were serenaded home with music. The wind had started so several waves splashed in the open side of the boat, so people put on their jackets or moved away to the middle seats.

Once you get to the island you are greeted by the kids who just want money. Then you have to walk alot just to get to the statute. Once up there there restaurants and food vendors everywhere. 3 of my family members decided to get some grilled corn I must say I did enjoy it. Then my wife asked where I bought and I showed her where from.  She immediately said her hands ar dirty and she handles both money and food with out washing her hands.  I threw my corn out after I had ate half of it.  Once we got back to where we were staying the 3 that ate started feeling sick. All night we had vomit and diarrhea and it only got worse as the night went on.  Then the stomach cramps started and this lasted all the following day. So if you decide to visit look how they handle their food and how often do they wash there hands. Just trying to help your stay in Mexico more pleasant and not a whole day in bed missing out on the rest this country has to offer.

On it is a giant statue that many mistake for a replica of the Christ Statue in Rio, similar to the one in Taxco.  But it I actually a statue of Jose Maria Morelos, a hero of the Mexican Revolution.  It is 40 meters tall and you can actually go to the top of the interior of the statue, viewing paintings of the life and history of Moreles by  Ram\\u00f3n Alba de la Canal and other great Mexican muralists.  Getting to the statue is not for the weak or faint at heart as it requires climbing lots and lots (and lots more) of stairs.  Once there the stairs to the top are steep and crowded.  But once inside the raised fist of Moreles you can look through peep-holes and the view is spectacular.  Or if you are lazy you can buy postcards with the picture at the dock.\\n\\nThe only way to the island is by boat.  The boats run back and forth all day with the last boat leaving the Island at 6.  You don\\u2019t want to miss the boat, because I do not believe there is a hotel on the Island.  There are lots of shops and places to eat.  At one time the economy was based on fishing, but as the piscado blanco have shrunk in numbers tourist are the major industry.\\n\\nThe island is interesting, as is the boat trip which usually includes a demonstration of the famous \\u201cbutterfly net\\u201d fishermen in the lake.  Because the only way back and forth is by boat it is interesting at times when residents of the island get on the boat with lumber, groceries or other supplies.  \\n\\nThe trip is interesting and everyone who is visiting should go see the island if they have time.  However, other than the fact it is an island and the indigenous people live there, there is little to see or do.

I was extremely excited about the bus trip and I wanted to see a part of Mexico that I had not seen before and the best part about it was that I did not have to drive. I had read the travel advisories for Morelia and Michoac\\u00e1n BUT I thought what the heck, you only live once so away we went. We arrived to Morelia and the bus station was much smaller and a lot less secure looking than Mexico City BUT NOT ONE time did we encounter any hostility or even a negative stare. Everyone was nice and friendly. We took a taxi from the bus station to the town of Patzcuaro where we could board the boat out to the island. You can also take a bus from Morela to Patzcuaro. I believe that on of the operators called Purepecha runs every 20 to 30 minutes. This is not a luxury bus by any means BUT it is a good way to interact with the locals. How do I know this you might ask? Because we decided to be brave and take the bus from Patzcuaro back to Morelia and it was a very interesting experience. Once you arrive to Patzcuaro you take a short walk to the embarcadero (pier) and pay your few pesos to board a boat. Once the boat leaves the pier the real experience starts. It is a nice boat ride out across Lake Patzcuaro to the island. Parents with children can buy little fishing nets before leaving the pier and their children can let their nets skim the water during the boat ride. Just before arriving to the island the local &quot;Butterfly Fishermen&quot; will come out to meet the boat and put on a show with their butterfly nets. It is quite the show. Once finished a couple of them will come along side your boat for tips. Please don\\'t be stingy, give them a few pesos or even more as they do provide a great experience. Also so lucky child with a fishing net on board the boat will find a live fish dropped into his or her net as well. As your boat arrives to the island the local children will come out and meet the boat. These kids will ask for Pesos. I can tell you that I arrived to the island with a pocket full of change and left with none but that is OK as I love kids and it made me feel good. Once on the island you can go exploring. They people are nice and friendly. There are plenty of shops for local merchandise and restaurants are in no short supply. If you have the energy climb to the top just below the statue of Jose Maria Morelos and have lunch / dinner at the Restaurante Monarca. Ask to sit upstairs on the patio and you will not regret the experience nor the view. Once finished with your meal finish the climb to the top to the statue of Jose Maria Morelos and look around. Enjoy the view and the experience. Once you have had enough you can make your way back down to the pier and catch the next boat back to Patzcuaro. The boats run continuously so you don\\'t have to worry about there not being a boat for you. They run basically from 07:30 to about 6:00 pm. Folks let me say again, I read all of the travel advisories and almost talked myself and my group of friends out of going BUT I am glad that I did not. This was a once in a life time experience and I will do it again real soon.

The inside of the statue has a lot of painted murals depicting Mexican history.  By luck, we were there on a Monday and there was going to be a rodeo in the local bullring that evening.  The plaza area by the boat docks was packed with people eating and getting ready for the event.  As we were leaving they all marched in a parade accompanied by a several bands over to the bullring.  It looked like it was really going to be a festive evening.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Isla Janitzio", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/b7/4a/c0/isla-janitzio.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Patzcuaro", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "258074452": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A Must Visit while in Patzcuaro!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499420-d153688-Reviews-Isla_Janitzio-Patzcuaro_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/b7/4a/c0/isla-janitzio.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I can\\'t imagine visiting Patzcuaro and not going to Isla Janitzio.

The streets meander every which way as you climb to the top.  Many climb the interior staircase of the statue of Jose Morelos which was built in 1930.  Whether you climb or not, the views are amazing.  More cafes on the top and some street performers, particularly the Dance of the Old Men...which is quite good and shouldn\\'t be missed.  Visit the cemetary where on Day of the Dead, the entire island is in party mode...unlike other villages nearby where on this night, it\\'s a bit more solemn.

Jaime is the guide of guides...I just wanted to refer to him as Professor, he has my utmost respect! And he made sure we all laughed and had fun.
