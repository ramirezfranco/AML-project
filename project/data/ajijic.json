It is still used at certain times and the English-speaking Catholic community uses it in Holy Week every year. Today\\'s main church (templo in Spanish) was built around 1754. It is quite beautiful and very clean. It is on its own plaza near the main plaza and hosts a spectacular Passion Play every year at the end of Lent. The English-speaking community celebrated Mass every Sunday at 9 am with a wonderful choir of local Mexicans and expats. The congregation meets after the Sunday Liturgy for a brunch at a local restaurant and that is an excellent way to meet other foreigners who live in the area.

These &quot;grave goods&quot;are all symbols of their hope for their family\\'s eternal happiness and represent the things that made the deceased happy in life. \\n\\nThere are two large flat stones in the back of the cemetery where you find the graves of the author Dane Chandos and his father. Chandos (pen name) was a British visitor who lived near Ajijic on Lake Chapala for 40 years and built the first inn (posada). He may have been the first foreigner living in the area. He died in the late 1940s in Guadalajara of TB and his father died within a year of Chandos\\' death. The graves are near the chapel and nearly against the back wall. The foreign community owes much to this gentleman but his grave is a bit neglected except for an old inscription on the flat stone naming his books. &quot;House in the Sun&quot;, his history of his life in the area and the interesting visitors from other parts of the world, can still be found sometimes on eBay.

And not to mention local business who think noise will attract business, so they blast their music at full volume.\\n\\nAll of these things ruin what would be a wonderful place in Mexico. Ajijic is a town mainly of foreign expats who live in Mexico. I am sure most of these people also desire the quietness they once used to enjoy in this area before local Mexican merchants started changing what was a peaceful place. There is much to fall in love with Ajijic, a colonial settlement with cobblestone streets which is close to the second largest city in Mexico, Guadalajara. But then you have the locals peddling anything for a buck.\\n\\nWhen you are visiting places in Mexico, remember they charge for everything. Even to use a dirty bathroom, there will be someone charging money to go into the bathroom. The restrooms are located on the park side of the malecon. It feels strange, but that is how they operate in Mexico, as this is seen throughout the country, at gas stations, parks, malls, rest stops, bus stations, etc.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ajijic Malecon", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/b7/8d/90/ajijic-malecon.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ajijic lakefront Del Paseo & Morelos", "addressLocality": "Ajijic", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "45920", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "281216662": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nice and peaceful Lakefront", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499405-d2300167-Reviews-Ajijic_Malecon-Ajijic.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/b7/8d/90/ajijic-malecon.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "It is a nice , quiet place to relax, and spend time either by yurself or in company.

We had read that it\\u2019s climate was perfect year round and that there were many services due to the large number of expatriates living in the area.  Our concern as we near retirement is the cost of living as our retirement income will be significantly less than our working income.\\n\\nWe arrived in the late afternoon and were picked up at the Guadalajara airport  by the Ajijic Suites Hotel co-owner, Luis. It was nice to have the pre-arranged pick up at the airport\\u2026one less worry.  Luis told us about the area as we rode to Ajijic. The area consists of small towns and villages around the very large Lake Chapala, surrounded by mountains.  Very beautiful.  The Ajijic Suites were very charming, clean and comfortable. The hotel is central and within walking distance to the plaza, restaurants and shopping. Elaine, the co-owner, and Luis\\u2019 wife, gave us many tips and advice throughout our week-long stay. I believe Luis is available to give certain tours for a nominal fee. They both made us feel welcomed and comfortable. There is free wifi and telephones available in the lobby for local Mexican calls and calls to the U.S. The tap water is not potable and so you will find a container in the bathroom filled with potable water for brushing your teeth, as well as potable water in the kitchenette and refrigerator. It is where we will be staying on our second trip to Ajijic.   Ajijic Suites Hotel has a good website, just google Ajijic Suites on Calle Hidalgo #72.\\n\\n The weather was beautiful, around 70-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The mornings and later evenings were cooler and a light sweater is advised.  For those of you who have not traveled into the interior of Mexico: because of the sewer systems, toilet paper cannot be put into the toilets and a bagged receptacle is there for this purpose.  This is the rule everywhere in this area.  Despite the picture that may come into your head, it is not a difficult thing to get used to.  My tip, buy a portable hand bidet or plastic, squeezable bottle. The toilets are very clean and no foul smells.\\n\\nOur first night we ate in a restaurant called El Tango. A very nice restaurant but with very little Mexican food. We had pasta that was very delicious. We arrived about 4:30 p.m.and soon after, the restaurant was packed with Americans and other expatriates! We tried, unsuccessfully twice to go again but the waiting was from one to two hours\\u2026.go early (4 pm) to get in. There are many other wonderful restaurants in Ajijic, many with American themes and owned by Americans. We especially liked the food at the Early Bird Cafe and the Bird of Paradise Restaurant.\\n\\n.We were fortunate to be in Ajijic when the annual Mexican Artisan Art Fair was being held. The most beautiful and high quality folk art was for sale and several presentations (how to wear a rebozo and others) made the adventure even more interesting.\\n\\nSince we had no car we did lots of walking. This was not that easy considering the streets are a very rough cobblestone. Some sidewalks were pretty good though. If you like to wear heels, bring walking shoes and a bag to carry your heels. I did see a few women with heels but you would have to walk slowly and carefully.\\n\\nBob and I took the bus to  Guadalajara (50 pesos ($4.00) each, which took about 40 minutes. It was an easy venture. Buy the ticket on the bus but be careful to use the \\u201cDirecto\\u201d bus or you will be stopping at every town and it will take you much longer.. At the bus station in Guadalajara we took a taxi to Tonala for some shopping. This was farther than we expected but cost around 100 pesos (about $8.00).\\n\\nOverall our experience was very good. Our accommodations were clean, nice and comfortable. The people of Ajijic were very friendly, and everywhere you go people speak English. If you are American and need to be near Americans to feel comfortable, this is the place for you. Americans everywhere! The food in the restaurants was excellent. The cost was very reasonable although not as inexpensive as we expected. We were told that costs were less in the other villages. Everyone we met was willing to give us advice about living in the Lake Chapala area. We plan to make our second visit  this coming summer. \\nBob and Rosa Killips, Michigan, USA", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ajijic Malecon", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/b7/8d/90/ajijic-malecon.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ajijic lakefront Del Paseo & Morelos", "addressLocality": "Ajijic", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "45920", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "145261993": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Local improvements", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499405-d2300167-Reviews-Ajijic_Malecon-Ajijic.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/b7/8d/90/ajijic-malecon.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I was impressed that a local couple took it upon themselves to improve the area by paying to have the area cleaned up, put in new garbage cans, a newly created bench and potted flowers along one part of the Malecon... well done John and Linda.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ajijic Malecon", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/b7/8d/90/ajijic-malecon.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ajijic lakefront Del Paseo & Morelos", "addressLocality": "Ajijic", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "45920", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "145191823": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Relaxation at its best.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499405-d2300167-Reviews-Ajijic_Malecon-Ajijic.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/b7/8d/90/ajijic-malecon.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "It\\'s gorgeous and I hope it never gets busy on the weekends with Tapatios like Chapala.
