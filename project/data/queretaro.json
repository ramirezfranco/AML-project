The Palacio de Gobierno on the north side of the plaza is the ceremonial office of the Governor of Quer\\u00e9taro State and he initiates the festivities of Mexican independence from its balcony on the night of September 15.  In the colonial era, this building was the residence of the Corregidor (Chief Magistrate) of Quer\\u00e9taro and, perhaps more importantly, his wife the Corregidora, who is arguably the most famous woman in modern Mexican history.  She took part on the so-called conspiracy to overthrow Spanish colonial rule in 1810 and is celebrated throughout the city.  Their busts are displayed in the building\\u2019s courtyard, where you can also see several dramatic murals depicting Mexican and local history.\\n\\nThe fountain in the center of the Plaza, a favorite meeting point for queretanos and visitors, is popularly referred to as the \\u201cdog fountain\\u201d, because it features the water-spouting hunting dogs of the gentleman portrayed in the statue, the Marqu\\u00e9s de la Villa del Villar del \\u00c1guila.  He was the nobleman who financed the famous aqueduct of Quer\\u00e9taro (which you can visit on the east side of the city) that brought water to the town center derived from suburban sources.  If you read Spanish, check out the inscriptions on the side of the statue.  You\\u2019ll learn not only *exactly* how much the aqueduct cost, but also that the statue of the Marqu\\u00e9s placed on the site in the mid-19th century was blown off its pedestal during the siege of Quer\\u00e9taro in 1867.  (For more on that subject, visit the Museo de la Restauraci\\u00f3n de la Rep\\u00fablica on Calle Guerrero)\\n\\nAll of the buildings surrounding the square are of historical interest.  For a thorough understanding of them, the authoritative guidebook (in Spanish only) is Gu\\u00eda de la Plaza de la Independencia by Beatriz Padilla Siurob, which is available at the nearby bookstore under the portico on Avenida Corregidora next to the Del Sol Department Store.\\n\\nThe restaurants on the south side of the plaza, Chuco El Roto and 1812, are somewhat expensive, but worth the extra cost for an excellent meal served in a delightful location.  The cafes on the east side of the plaza under the portico are great places for coffee, smoothies, and light meals.  All of the cafes offer wifi, but you have to ask the waiter or waitress for the password (clabe in Spanish).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Plaza de Armas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/53/9c/fc/plaza-de-armas-de-queretaro.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Plaza de Armas", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "243522786": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Very Good", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g479232-d2401026-Reviews-Plaza_de_Armas-Queretaro_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/53/9c/fc/plaza-de-armas-de-queretaro.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "On this Plaza there are always events, really nice restaurant, from this place a street market begins where you can find a lot of gifts.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Plaza de Armas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/53/9c/fc/plaza-de-armas-de-queretaro.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Plaza de Armas", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "241136053": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nostalgic beautifully maintained historic square", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g479232-d2401026-Reviews-Plaza_de_Armas-Queretaro_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/53/9c/fc/plaza-de-armas-de-queretaro.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Landscape trees lined the square in old downtown Queretaro.

The babies stay with their mother\\'s for quite a while before being moved out, and the sheep are kept in their natural groups, the young and adult males patiently waiting for the spring babies to move on without their mothers.

It\\'s a large site zoned into different areas, with adult fairground rides in one section (rollercoaster, pirate ship, river rapids ride, dodgem cars among others), children\\'s fairground rides in another (small &quot;caterpillar&quot; and &quot;mouse&quot; rollercoasters, traditional carousel, jumping frog ride among others), a lake with pedalo-type boats for hire and a scenic railway around the edge, a small arena for &quot;charro&quot;-type shows, a large covered area for picnics, an aquatic park section with large waterslides, a zipslide across the lake, and other small attractions. Complementing the site are a medical centre, small athletic stadium and school.\\n\\n The whole site is clean and well maintained. The cost is currently only 35 pesos, an incredible bargain as it gives you access to all attractions with the exception of the boats and the zipslide, for which there is an extra charge. The site is open from 11am to 6pm from Tuesday to Sunday in holiday season, and Thursday to Sunday the rest of the time.\\n\\n General tips:\\n\\n 1) Public transport from the center of Queretaro is on routes 74 and 121.\\n\\n2) There are two car parks for the site. The easiest to get to is on the Av 5 de febrero, and is marked for public transport only, although most people that take their own cars seem to prefer to park there too. The other is on the libramiento Norponiente - San Miguel de Allende. This second car park is 1km from the park, there is a shuttle bus, or the walk is very easy (downhill). On busier days the first car park gets very busy with long queues to enter the park. The second car park is much quieter.\\n\\n 3) You may take your own food into the park if it is already prepared and packaged (in plastic containers for example). No cooking allowed in the park. No glass containers.\\n\\n4) Nobody may take any drinks or liquids into the park. All drink to be purchased inside.\\n\\n5) The sun is incredibly fierce and shade is at a premium, take hats and plenty of high-factor sunscreen to apply frequently, especially in the water park.\\n\\n6) Food stalls are scattered around the park, a burger-fries-and-drink package will cost around 50 to 60 pesos. There are ice cream stalls and plenty of places to buy drinks.\\n\\n7) Each ride has height restrictions that are strictly enforced. On some rides children must be accompanied by an adult. \\n\\n In summary, this is an wonderful family-friendly and safe attraction, and in comparison with its very low entrance fee offers huge value for money. Just make sure you leave enough time to enjoy all the park has to offer (a whole day at least!).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Parque Bicentenario", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/a3/e6/f0/parque-bicentenario.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Bicentenario #10", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Santuario_de_la_Virgen_de_Schoenstatt-Queretaro_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coas": {"643056054": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Interesting and peaceful sanctuary", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g479232-d3388504-Reviews-Santuario_de_la_Virgen_de_Schoenstatt-Queretaro_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coas.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/87/45/c0/santuario-de-la-virgen.jpg", "datePublished": "January 2, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "One of many Schonestatt sanctuaries around the world, this one has a quiet garden and a very beautiful chapel, great place for a nice walk and relaxing time", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Santuario de la Virgen de Schoenstatt", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/87/45/c0/santuario-de-la-virgen.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "En El Pueblito Mnpo.Corregidora Rancho Los Olvera,", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "451101140": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "peaceful", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g479232-d3388504-Reviews-Santuario_de_la_Virgen_de_Schoenstatt-Queretaro_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coas.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/87/45/c0/santuario-de-la-virgen.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "a beatuful place to walk and find peace and confort, silent.\\nAmazing gardens with beautiful and exotic plants, To find inside feelings", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Santuario de la Virgen de Schoenstatt", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/87/45/c0/santuario-de-la-virgen.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "En El Pueblito Mnpo.Corregidora Rancho Los Olvera,", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "434576813": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "&quot;Please of Peace&quot;", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g479232-d3388504-Reviews-Santuario_de_la_Virgen_de_Schoenstatt-Queretaro_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coas.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/87/45/c0/santuario-de-la-virgen.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Its just a simple and beautiful place and it very peaceful and this was my very first visit to this site.

All that is left is a bunch of cheap knick-knacks, drinks or tours for sale.  There is very little soul or a sense of pride still inhabiting the town.

I couldn\\u2019t wait to get out after the climb.  \\n\\nI am a fit 60-year-old and it took me 30-35 minutes to climb all the way up and 45 to get back down since I had to wait for so many people to pass by before continuing.

I can\\u2019t believe some people come here only wearing sandals, good shoes are recommended for traction on the slippery rocks.  \\n\\nThe view is not that interesting especially since the air is so dirty and dusty.

Local bus takes 45 min and costs around 65 pesos per person one way trip. We got there at 11 o\\'clock in the morning which is a bit too late since sun is very strong already. I strongly recommend to get there at 8, have some breakfast there and then head to the monolite to climb. The mountain is only like 1,5 km approx from the bus stop but the last part is quite climby so if you see a small kind of tuc tuc taxi by the road take it to the foot of the mountain. You will climb enough. (30 pesos for 2 ppl) It is possible to climb half the mountain without any special Equipment. It is quite steep and warm but with plenty of resting spots along the way. Bring water and maybe a snack. It is a quite physically challenging walk since the steps can be high. Interesting to read about the mountain on the several info boards also. We enjoyed a perfect Italian coffe at Caf\\u00e9 del Cielo and had great food and service at Meson the la Roca restaurant. I can warmly recommend both.

Maybe 10 - 15 minutes later (estimate, didn\\'t pay close enough attention!), the bus will stop in the little down where there are some restaurants and rows of shops -- it should also be the stop when most people get off. Even though the rock looks far away, it\\'s an easy walk! I\\'m terrible at finding my way, but the town is so small and simple that I managed perfectly. Don\\'t hesitate to ask shopkeepers along the way which way to go. The town is very calm and safe and I never felt uncomfortable (as a solo woman traveler). Soon, as you come to the base of the mountain, you can just follow the crowd of people and up you go :) There is no entrance fee or anything. Don\\'t forget to reward yourself with some gorditas after you\\'ve made it back down! Then, just retrace your steps kinda where the bus dropped you off -- look for the Barbacoa restaurant, ask around. It is on a corner. Ask the people waiting there to make sure that you\\'re on the correct side of the street. I\\'m not sure what the bus schedule is, so I just waited around.

It\\'s a little hike through the village (really quiet mid-week), with lots of little snack bars and souvenir stands.  Then you kind of wind your way up through the streets to the base of the Pena.  There\\'s a really good ice cream place half way up on the left where samples are offered.  It just looks like a small open room, so keep an eye out. \\nWe followed (we thought) the trail to the right at the base up the hill, but then got told by a park warden on a ATV that the trail was closed, and we had to go back down.  Then we found the other trail, which was far more rocky.  It\\'s fairly steep and rough in places, and after coming from almost sea level, I found the air quite thin.  I needed to take a break every couple of minutes, as I just couldn\\'t get enough oxygen with each breath.  By the time I got to the final look-out (maybe about 30 minutes from the base), my legs felt dead.  Really nice view from there, and I went past the look-out onto the open rock face, but felt with my now-wobbly legs, I shouldn\\'t be taking too many chances on a steep face with no railings.  So I didn\\'t get to see over the other side, but at least I survived to tell the tale!  It\\'s not really that tough, but if you haven\\'t acclimatized to the elevation (about 2500m), then you might find it challenging.  My teenagers were really tired, but we saw a 2 year old walk up, so I guess it depends on what you are used to.  \\nNice BBQ restaurant on the main highway across from the bus stop on the way back.  \\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Pena de Bernal", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/6c/37/62/bernal.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ubicada en Villa De Bernal, No En Quer\u00e9taro", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "147394623": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "LOVE IT", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g479232-d2228254-Reviews-La_Pena_de_Bernal-Queretaro_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/6c/37/62/bernal.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "been many times, quaint little town, good restaurants and the pena is always fun to climb!  highly recommended", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Pena de Bernal", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/6c/37/62/bernal.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ubicada en Villa De Bernal, No En Quer\u00e9taro", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "146242188": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g479232-d2228254-Reviews-La_Pena_de_Bernal-Queretaro_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/6c/37/62/bernal.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "La piedad esta muy bonito y el pueblo muy pintoresco.  //  The boulder is amazing and the town is very cute.

Ask where the Fleche Azul counter is and purchase a ticket from QRO to Bernal for 36 pesos ($3 US). Finding the bus (out of about 100 vehicles) can be a bit challenging, so ask a friendly face where it is or look for the Fleche Azul bus with a laminated sign that says, &quot;Bernal / Colon.&quot; The bus ride will take about 30 minutes or so to reach the town. You\\'ll basically pass back near the airport, zoo, hit a few towns, before you start seeing more mountainous terrain and signs counting down to Bernal (25, miles, 17 miles, 14 miles, etc.). You\\'ll know you\\'re near Bernal when you see the &quot;Pena&quot; towering over on the left hand side of the bus. There are two stops near Bernal - one just outside the city proper and then one on the small highway that drops you off in the middle of restaurant row with gorditas stands and local shops. Cross the street, walk along the small highway, until you get to a corner where the BBQ / Barbacoa stand is sitting housed under an awning. Turn left and head down into the &quot;centro historico,&quot; where you\\'ll basically run into everything like Casa Tsayas (highly recommended, about 800 - 1000 pesos or $60 to $80 US) and other hotels (the square is not large at all). Give yourself about two to three hours to hike up and down the Pena (you\\'ll get about two-thirds up before you\\'ll need climbing gear). I wouldn\\'t stop for a beer until after you\\'re coming down, since the hike up will leave you sweating and out of breath. To catch the bus back to QRO, there\\'s no bus counter. Basically, stand on the corner across from that BBQ / Barbacoa stand I mentioned (there might be a tour guide stand there too), and wait (up to one hour - yes, up to one hour!) for the Fleche Azul / Amarillo  to show up (find some shade, grab a gordita, and wait). You pay an attendant 36 pesos when you\\'re seated on the bus. Sit back, sleep, and enjoy the ride back to the bus station. You can go to the taxi counter and get a metered ticked back into the Centro Historico of QRO for another 36 pesos (everything is 36 pesos!). I stayed the night in Bernal at Casa Tsayas (beautiful boutique hotel), though there\\'s not much to do at night but dine in a local restaurant and listen to music while drinking cocktails. I wanted to take a wine tour to the nearby Ezequiel Montes (Freixenet, La Redonda, Azteca) but there were only two tour times (11 am and 3 p.m.), and it was noon - so I had the tour guide talk to a taxi driver (which happened to be dropping off a Mexican family, not many taxis otherwise) who drove me around and waited for me at the vineyards for 80 pesos ($8 an hour) - but I only recommend this if your Spanish is decent, it\\'s the afternoon, and you\\'re comfortable with the safety of the driver (I was). The ride out to the vineyards was 15 minutes and they\\'re spaced about 5 minutes apart - La Redonda was my favorite though Freixenet was like &quot;Wine&quot; Disneyland with more to taste.

Once the murder took place, the woman later killed the servant herself in the house so he wouldn\\'t talk of the event. It is said that she buried the bodies in the stables. There are a pair of human remains that you can see from the patio of the house. The woman was later found dead outside the house and her murder remains a mystery to this day. There are some who say her ghost can be seen around the house.\\nIn that house, they also started the paperwork  for the second Emperor of Mexico Maximiliano de Habsburgo\\'s trial, who was later executed with other two generals: Tom\\u00e1s Mej\\u00eda and Miguel Miram\\u00f3n in El Cerro de las Campanas. Miramon\\'s body was embalmed in one of the rooms inside this house. \\nIf you are familiar with Mexico\\'s history, you will find it interesting.

Each room features a great collection of antiques from different times in history. \\nThe entrance is pretty cheap (less than $3.00 USDLLRS) and contributes to restore some of the old paintings and the maintenance of the house.

The doors opened at 7:00 PM and the patio soon filled with about 200 plus guests. There were the usual speeches from museum and city dignitaries. These were not too long winded and the people who make a museum like this possible really should be recognized.\\n\\nThe entertainment started with Flamenco dancing. Around the fountain in the center of the main patio stood four dancers. Each dancer in turn performed Flamenco unaccompanied by music. Each dancer performed in turn around the fountain. It was very dramatic. The next performance was a free style emotively interpretative performance of music by a man playing a synthesizer. I am always amazed at these types of musical presentation because they are repeatable, but I don\\u2019t know how. The dancers returned to a stage in the corner of the patio for their final performance to music. This time the full ensemble of 8 or more dancers were performing. They were beautiful and technically elegant.\\n\\nThe gallery of new art was then opened upstairs. The name of the presentation was Sensaciones Compartidas which means shared sensations. I would describe it as interactive art. Many of the pieces were meant to be touched as well as seen. I did get into trouble at one of the displays. It was a solitary picture of a pan dulce with a tray of the same sweet bread directly below the photo. The viewer was invited to take a piece of the pan, which I did. It was now about 8:30 and I was starving so I took a bight of the art. That was a mistake. The museum food police immediately instructed that eating inside the gallery was forbidden so I rushed outside to finish my treat.\\n\\nQueretaro knows how to throw a party. After the gallery had been open for a while the museum served wine and hors d\\u2019oeuvres to the guests. Red or white wine was served in tall wine glasses. The waiters who served the appetizers were mobbed with each appearance. Evidently, the other patrons were as hungry as I was but at least they were in the common area away from the art.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Museum of Arts of Queretaro", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/45/86/17/museum-of-arts-of-queretaro.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Ignacio Allende sur 14 Centro Historico", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "76000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "174293654": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "very nice", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g479232-d2315125-Reviews-Museum_of_Arts_of_Queretaro-Queretaro_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/45/86/17/museum-of-arts-of-queretaro.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The building is amazingly beautiful, as many buildings in Quer\\u00e9taro.

So my husband and I decided to drive up to Jalpan de Serra in our rental car to check out the missions.  After a harrowing, 3 hour drive through curvy mountain roads, we finally arrived at Jalpan de Serra.  And during the 3 hour drive, the landscape was almost completely desolate and we drove for miles and miles without seeing a single sign of human habitation.  There were only a few small towns on the way, nowhere that you could stop and eat or stay for the night.  The landscape was interesting and beautiful, but in my opinion not worth the long drive.  When we arrived at Jalpan at 8 PM, we found a choice of 3 not-so-nice hotels and no restaurants that were open.  Especially would not advise going there if you don\\'t speak Spanish (which my husband does) but we didn\\'t encounter anyone who spoke English.  We settled for eating at an outdoor taco stand, which was good, and I was relieved that I didn\\'t get sick from eating the food, but I was quite fearful that I would.  The hotel, the Los Angeles, was cheap, but had one of the most uncomfortable beds I\\'ve slept in.  In the morning, we had trouble finding breakfast ... they didn\\'t even have a traditional Mexican bakery, which I\\'ve seen all over Mexico.  We visited the church in the main square, which was nothing fantastic, and then stopped at a small tourist kiosk for information on the missions.  The Jalpan mission, we discovered, was the church in the middle of the town square.  Of the countless churches I\\'ve visited in Mexico, trust me this was nothing special.  We then learned that the remaining 4 missions were scattered through the Sierra Gordas at driving distances ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours away.  I said forget it, eager to get back to civilization and a decent meal.  Then of course we had a 3 hour drive back, which we did have the highlight of the Sierra Gorda experience of visiting the Cascade de Chuveye waterfall, which was peaceful and gorgeous.  All in all, I really regret spending all that time driving up there, and wish I would have used the time to visit somewhere else.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Franciscan Missions", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/64/d7/c5/franciscan-missions.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Sierra Gorda de Queretaro Jalpan de Serra.

To me it was kind of like visiting a farm with zoo animals as, rather than displaying animals in cages, there were expansive areas where they could roam, often with various other species. Many animals were separated from the walkway by a low wall, tho some (tigers, lions, wolves, etc.) were \\nbehind fences. You can get quite close to most of them, &amp; unlike in many traditional zoos, most  of the animals were awake &amp; alert, meaning good photo -ops. There are said to be 1800 animals, 250 species, from 5 continents. Our favorites were the 2 leopard cubs, born in Dec. 2014. You can get there by city bus #314 near Alameda Park, in the Historical Center.The entrance fee was inexpensive.

The place is very deserted, lacks of shades and places to rest.  The price,of the tickets is expensive compared to similar zoo\\'s (90 pesos adults, 70 pesos children).\\n\\nThere are several attractions that are worth seeing, for instance feeding the giraffe was quite an experience.  There is an extra tour in a small &quot;train&quot;, 20 pesos a ticket, the train has a speaker that tries to narrate the animals on the cages,but most of the time the narration does not match what you are seeing.  There is an useless pit that looks pretty unsafe. Bathrooms are very clean.\\n\\nsome of the animals don\\'t look quite good, they don\\'t look bad, but thy don\\'t great like in other zoos.  There ar free peacocks that look fabulous.\\n\\nThe whole zoo can be walked in 2:30 to 3 hours.  Price-benefit relationship seems very bad.  I will think it twice before returning.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zoologico Wameru", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/54/98/ca/zoologico-wameru.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera Bernal _ Cadereyta Km.2.5 Marquez", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}}
