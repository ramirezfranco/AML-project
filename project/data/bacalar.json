It has everything you need; ATM, hospital, bars, restaurants, street vendors, souvenir shops, one campground that is right on the lake, hostels, hotels all on a great seven color lagoon. The lagoon is big enough for motorboats, water-skiers, jet-skies, sightseeing watercraft\\'s, sailboats and much more.\\nThis fresh water lagoon is known as \\u201cLas Lagunas de Siete Colores\\u201d (The Lagoon of 7 Colors) and is landlocked. It is very shallow with a light reflecting bottom that changes colors depending upon time of day and lighting conditions. It is an excellent place to swim and camp. \\nThe water is beautiful, clear and with colors changing from white to the deepest blue. At this location there are special live formations called Stromatoites that date back some 3,500,000 years. At night the moonlight prances on the water like thousands of fireflies were dancing on it. An added bonus is right now there are not many mosquitoes or other biting insects to spoil the night\\u2019s enjoyment. \\nCenote Azul (Blue Sinkhole) is separated from Laguna Bacalar only by a narrow strip of land but entirely different and reported to be more than 175 feet (57 meters) deep. For M$10 you can access this great swimming hole through the restaurant. Spending a hot sunny day in a cool deep blue sinkhole is great way to spend time and have a bite to eat.\\nSinkholes here are caves of soft limestone that collapsed and exposed the freshwater rivers within. There are more that 6000 of them and are unique to the Yucatan peninsula; the freshwater within is considered to be sacred waters. The Mayans thought that the underground rivers and streams that are found in these cenotes are gateways to Xibalba or the underworld. Another theory is that some 65 million years ago the Chicxulub meteor impacted the area and a huge proliferation beginning at a radius of more than 100km (62 miles), but looking at a map the cenotes are not in that area. This meteor is the one that is thought to be the start of the ice age and causing the extinction of the dinosaurs. \\nMy first plan was to stay for just a few days then head on up to Cozumel where I had planned to sell my two scuba tanks and maybe a wetsuit to one of the dive shops. That would have given me some extra cash then I could afford to snorkel with the whale sharks ($150US) and do a few other things, but that has fallen flat. Now I am planning where to go next. \\nThe Balneario Cocalitos Campground is $7.50US per night for me; it is lovely and right on the lake.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cocalitos", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/1e/62/a7/getlstd-property-photo.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av costera a tan solo 5 minutos del Cenote Azul", "addressLocality": "Bacalar", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "77500", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "169746163": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Excellent Campground right on the shore.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g1202648-d4452262-Reviews-Cocalitos-Bacalar_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/1e/62/a7/getlstd-property-photo.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This campground has showers and bathrooms.

The guide asked if anyone wanted to swim over the 100 meter Negro, but none of us did. It was early and we weren\\'t hot enough I guess. It would have been eerie due to the depth and darkness, and the cove was shady too.\\n\\nWe drove around cenote Cocalitos to see the stromalitos, but you really have to go there and swim amongst them on another visit. See my review on Cocalitos. \\n\\nOur final stop was at the Pirate Canal. The water was shallow and warm and we had a sulfer mud bath to purify our skin.\\n\\nI also enjoyed seeing the houses and hotels alone the coast. To find the tour, go down to the beach road from the square near the fort. There are several to choose from, we used Y por que no? The boats wait until they are full before going out.

Spending the night in the town for dinner, etc. \\nUnlike the negative comments, I have to say this town is very safe, I traveled solo and the park is very nice, there are taxi drivers all over the place, they offered good rates for the trips and there is accommodation for all budgets.\\n\\nADO station is close and convis are also available. From Cancun to here by bus the rate is around 360 pesos. The ride is 5 hours and 30 minutes. You can also get there from Playa del Carmen, I got a special rate ticket for only 168 pesos.\\nTulum is about 3 hours and a half away, ADO buses are not always available, so you can take a convi for 60 pesos to a near town called Carrillo and from there another to Tulum.\\n\\nThis place deserves you staying for at least a couple of nights!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Lake Bacalar", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/93/64/41/lake-bacalar.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Bacalar", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "542728060": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Amazing and breath-taking views ", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g1202648-d8489023-Reviews-Lake_Bacalar-Bacalar_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/93/64/41/lake-bacalar.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The waters of the lagoon are absolutely incredible!!

It is pretty poorly maintained, so this may be  good for whoever is seeking for a true &quot;local/ authentic experience&quot;. \\n\\nWe had our own &quot;local experience&quot; when trying to get a boat to tour the Laguna.

What we got was that shaky small motor boat, no drinks were included (the boat stopped at a restaurant where we could purchase drinks on our account) and the guide didn\\'t know anything about the Laguna and threw some words in English to satisfy the &quot;English speaking&quot; part. The tour lasted barely 2 hours, and of course we were crazily overcharged. All our complaints about the trip were dismissed by the organizers (and when I say organizers I means some creepy tattooed guys who sat on the shore). \\n\\nAt the end, we were left with a great sense of disappointment, with bad opinion of the locals and their culture (or lack of it) and just escaped that horrible place on the first bus. \\n\\nDo yourself a favor - either skip this lake if you are not in the area (we made a special round bus trip from and back to Tulum, where we stayed, which was TOTALLY a waste of time), or book a good tour in advance.
