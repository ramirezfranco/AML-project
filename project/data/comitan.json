After climbing the pyramid, you can swim in one of the lagoons.  There is also a mini waterfall where you can observe a lot of Guatemalans crossing for the day, sometimes just to swim there.  It is highly recommended if you are crossing to or from the Guatemalan border (Ciudad Cuauhtemoc /La Mesilla).  It is only about 30 minutes from the border.

Al cruzar la caseta de Montebello, comenta que vas a Las Nubes y as\\u00ed evitar\\u00e1s pagar la entrada al parque, desde ese momento y en adelante no hay recepci\\u00f3n de celular. La carretera tiene muchas curvas, muchos caminos de incorporaci\\u00f3n  y muchos topes, maneja con precauci\\u00f3n. Eventualmente encontrar\\u00e1s un letrero que dice Centro Ecotur\\u00edstico Las Nubes, da vuelta ah\\u00ed. En ese momento saldr\\u00e1s de la carretera principal y posteriormente encontrar\\u00e1s otro letrero donde igualmente debes dar vuelta, pon atenci\\u00f3n!!, no es tan llamativo. A partir del segundo letrero son 10 Km para llegar, alternando entre terraceria y camino medianamente pavimentado/empedrado. Un autom\\u00f3vil mediano puede entrar sin problemas, pero si tienes oportunidad de llevar una SUV o pickup disfrutaras muchos m\\u00e1s (y sin sufrir). La recomendaci\\u00f3n general siempre ser\\u00e1 que viajes de d\\u00eda y est\\u00e9s en tu destino a m\\u00e1s tardar a las 1800 hrs.

El restaurante cierra a las 1945 hrs, prevee llevar aperitivos, el poblado m\\u00e1s cercano est\\u00e1 a 1.0 Km y no est\\u00e1 permitido deambular despu\\u00e9s de las 2100 hrs. La comida y el caf\\u00e9 no son buenos y no es que esperara platillos Gourmet pero para la opciones que te ofrecen si esperaba mayor esmero en su preparaci\\u00f3n, adem\\u00e1s la calidad no va de la mano con los costos.

My family and I traveled to Chiapas, Mexico last year and visited 4 different cities in Chiapas including Comitan.  We visited many beautiful waterfalls and had a handful of amazing experience but none like the 3 Tzimoleras.  Hands down the 3 Tzimoleras was the best experience of our whole entire trip!  Angel and his crew including Sarain, made this adventure unforgettable.  We started the trip to the waterfall in a pickup truck which was an adventure all on its own.  There were 11 in our group including 2 young children.  Once there, we climbed down tons of stairs (with alot of help from Angel and his crew) to get to experience the most beautiful waterfalls you will ever see.  I say experience because you get to stand so close to the front of the waterfall and feel its tremendous power and admire its amazing beauty.  For those with more of an adventurous and brave spirit than me, you can take a 7 meter jump into the most beautiful blue lagoon you have ever seen close to the edge of the waterfall.  If you are brave enough to go through with it (only one in our family was) you are rewarded with a walk to the edge of the waterfall. My cousin did it and said it was the most unbelievable experience and one he will never forget.  In summary, if you ever find yourself in Chiapas, make sure you go to the 3 Tzimoleras.

I will recount the trip and what we did. We were seven friends, five of them live in San Cristibal and my husband and I live in New York. We lived in San Cristobal years ago but we come often to this part of the world. \\nThe trip starts in Simoleras, a small town where you can leave your car and get on a 4 wheel drive. You have to travel through corn fields and Angel and Quinie, the team leaders, will give you a historical summary of the origin of the name as well as the story of the ranch itself where the waterfall is located. You have to walk to get to your camp, which only adds to the adventurous spirit of this experience.\\nWe came to the Tres Simoleras under the recommendation of one of our friends. We planned the trip within a week and were excited to go. We found a wonderful group of young people who are eager to do things right. Angel, Quinie, Luis Antonio and Adrian are deeply committed to making your stay wonderful and safe. As a point of reference, I have to say that we a were all in our late fifties, sixties and even seventies. A member of the group had a knee replacement a few years back. The safety equipment and the care this group of young people showed was remarkable.\\nTres Simoleras is a stunning place. It has two beautiful sites in which you can camp, we stayed in the one right beside the waterfall. The water is blue and transparent, the waterfall magnificently beautiful. The sky at night is covered with stars. We went swimming and it was a beautiful experience. If you are more adventurous (and younger), the team can take you to a place where you can jump into the water (seven meter jump), and go up the mountain and see the waterfall from above. There are a number of tracks you can follow, but we stayed in our camping site and went swimming, enjoying its magnificent beauty and peacefulness.\\nYou will not regret going. It is a stunning place and a wonderful camping experience that Angel, Adrain, Quinie, and Luis Antonio will adapt to your needs. You will not be disappointed. \\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Las 3 Tzimoleras", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/b0/f6/7b/turquoise-water.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Comitan", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "30000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "440142562": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Hands down, best experience in Chiapas!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g1732578-d11837795-Reviews-Las_3_Tzimoleras-Comitan_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/b0/f6/7b/turquoise-water.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I cannot recommend this place more.

Swimming, kayaking, hiking and exploring caves are all wonderful possibilities: even just admiring the different colors of the lakes from the road on a sunny day is a treat. We usually stay at the Ecolodge in Tziscao, but there are other small hotels and cabins by the Tziscao lake as well. \\nIf you enjoy hiking, it is a good idea to hire a guide (the managers of the Ecolodge can put you in touch with honest and knowledgeable ones) and take any one of many treks through the jungle to see bromeliads, orchids, hidden cenotes and Mayan bas-reliefs carved on the rocks. The views of the different lakes are spectacular.  While one lake, La Encantada, has unfortunately been polluted, the lakes in the newer area of the park (taking the road to the right after the entrance booth) are pristine.  Pojoj, Tziscao and Cinco Lagos are particularly entrancing, with coves and islands to explore by kayak, raft or swimming. The lookout point above Cinco Lagos is blessed with a view worthy of a fantasy novel, and the stairs up to it are wedged between tiny restaurants with delicious local quesadillas, tamales, cheeses, chocolate and coffee. You can also buy some Guatemalan beer or sweets, and if you like them, take a 30 minute walk from the Ecolodge to the Guatemalan border, where you can pop across with no problem and shop for local crafts, Gallo beer or the tasty chiclosos (caramels).  \\nIf you are fascinated with the mysteries of sacred caves, take the road that goes straight beyond the entrance booth, park at the last parking lot and walk down the dirt road behind it to Paso del Soldado: a bridge over a little stream.  On the right just before you get to the bridge, there is a path that leads uphill to a huge natural arch and a smaller path that will take you to a stunning cave with glimmering green water at the bottom and sacred stalagmites adorned with ribbons and votive candles. \\nThe only caveat about this park is, don\\'t try to see it all from a bus on a 4 hour tour.  You, and the Lakes, deserve better than that.

Lake Tziscao flooded on New Year\\'s Day 2015 and when we went, Feb 2015, the water was still very high. This obviously makes it all the more important that tourists come and spend money at the community-run hotel, so go for it: the flooding doesn\\'t disturb the hotel except for making the lawn a bit squishy.

The major downside to the tour being that they took us to El Chiflon first - FOR 3 HOURS - and then we only had limited time (maybe 1.5 hours) at the Lagunas. In my opinion, El Chiflon warrants only an hour and the rest of the time should be spent at the Lagunas. The other thing about the tour (all of them are the same by the way) was that we were told we could swim at El Chiflon (yuk - cold and silty) but NOT at the Lagunas. This is NOT TRUE. Once we were at Laguna Pojoj (the one with the small island in the middle that they raft people out to) we asked if we could swim, and they told us we could. So we swam out to the island and back in beautiful, clear, fresh water.

As the park closes by 17o\\'clock it got much more peaceful and we almost had the entire place for us alone. If you are on the hunt for good photos/videos you might want to cross the river to get to see both sides. Apparently there are two different companies and there is no connecting bridge. Avoid weekends/holidays. There is a tiny shop and a restaurant (we had enough supplies bought in Comitan and did not need to do any shopping in the nearby village). The owners made a noticable effort to keep the place clean.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cascada El Chiflon", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/9d/72/b0/cascada-el-chiflon-tzimol.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "A 20 km de Comitan Ejido San Cristobalito Municipio De Tzimol Chiapas, Mexivco", "addressLocality": "Comitan", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "30110", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "277086660": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful waterfalls", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g1732578-d4931650-Reviews-Cascada_El_Chiflon-Comitan_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/9d/72/b0/cascada-el-chiflon-tzimol.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A series of many waterfalls that get gradually bigger until you reach the El Chiflon.

It\\'s around 45 minutes (because the roads are not so awsome) but it is totally worth it. Upon arrival you will be greated by one of the guides that work there. They are not paid by the owners, the offer their services and they have no fee, you can give them as much as you want. I didn\\'t hire a guide because we were in romantic mode ;) The place is like this: there are two parkings, both with a lot of space. Then you enter the place and you find the restrooms (warning! the restrooms are only at the entrance) and then you continue up the path and find some small huts that sell food and drinks (all run by local people). There are two main paths that run along the river/waterfalls. I took the one on the left (as you go up). BOth sides run along it, but the left one goes the highest and the view from there is amazing. Nobody told us that, but we got lucky, so I share the info. If you have enought time, you could even do both. It\\'s between 1 and 1.5 km up the hill. And it\\'s HOT. So take your time going up (I saw the guides were pretty fast-paced btw) and enjoy nature. After all, is only 1km :) It has numerous spots to stop and take pictures! And it is simply awsome. The 17 co-owners (all from tzeltal and tzotzil comunities) have kept it very natural and they do keep it very clean. Entrance fee is $30 mexican pesos (around 2 euros) per person. The river is cristal clear and very cold, but after going up and down under the sun, you\\'ll just want to get in there! You can camp there (we didn\\'t know, but if you like camping, TOTALLY consider bringing your equipment) and there are facilities for grilling too! There\\'s a small cafe with local food and a medium size restaurant.  \\nTIPS: if you come with family, bring nice food for grilling :) And plan arriving early, because it\\'s a place so peacefull that you\\'ll want to spend more than a couple hours there!

There are a few designated swimming areas with changing rooms. Swim in one on the way up and another on the way down. The water has a mineral that glazes over the rocks and creates different hues of blue.

The trail to the waterfall is extremely well cared for and we enjoyed our hike up. \\n\\nTo get there from Comitan city center you would need to get a bus from the main street. It cost like 25 pesos, tell them you want to go to Chiflon. The collectivo kind of a bus will drop you off at a crossroad. There are 3 wheelers there and you will be approached by one of the drivers who will then charge you around 15 pesos to the waterfall/park. There is also an entrance fee. From the gates of the park you have a very nice trail leading up to the Falls with breaks in between that let you walk right to the water itself. The rail is populated by butterflies, beautiful ones. We went right up to the Falls and it is a spectacular sight! Highly recommended\\nBonus is when you come back from the trail. Right where the shops are you will see a sign that says Iguanas. Walk up to the guard/information booth and ask to see the Iguanas. They will point them out to you as to the untrained eyes it is difficult to spot them. These guys are green or red and HUGE. We are talking at least 2 feet with long gorgeous tails. \\nTo get back you can take a 3 wheeler to the main road (this is something that will be available right at the entrance of the park, if you do not see one, just ask the information booth guard, he will call one in for you) The 3 wheeler will drop you off at the same cross roads and there you can flag down a collectivo bus back to Comitan.\\n\\nThis was a great experience for us and we enjoyed it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cascada El Chiflon", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/9d/72/b0/cascada-el-chiflon-tzimol.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "A 20 km de Comitan Ejido San Cristobalito Municipio De Tzimol Chiapas, Mexivco", "addressLocality": "Comitan", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "30110", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}}
