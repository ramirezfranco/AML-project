The Parque has the La Salle University on the west bank and growing Chihuahua neighborhoods around the Fashion Mall on the east and south banks. The Park was built to provide Chihuahuanese families a place to enjoy sports and the outdoors. The Park has a large 6.5 KM bike and jogging track which surrounds the lake providing great opportunities for runners, joggers and bikers to exercise in a beautiful setting. There are several exercise tracks to provide ample chances to work on strength and cardio while using the track. \\n\\nThere is a great family Center situated in the southeast section of the lake adjacent to the La Salle University. Here you can find Zumba classes, children\\'s play area, rest rooms and snack stands. There are children\\'s play areas all around as well as exercise tracks to warm up on before taking on your next 5k run or walk. \\n\\nAt Observation room, near the boat dock, you can attend scheduled yoga or spin classes or bring your telescope and setup on the roof to watch the stars at night. There are also restrooms, water and a small store for snacks here. They sell frozen popsicles here for 6 pesos and I highly recommend the chocolate flavor. There is a place to rent paddle boats or motor boats to travel on the lake for 20 to 30 pesos a half an hour for 2 to 5 people. There is also a place to rent bikes to travel on the 6.5 km track. \\n\\n On the high hill at the family center is a huge monument to the family which can be seen for miles. Make sure to walk up the steps to the Family Monument to enjoy great views of the lake, city and wonderful sunsets. \\n\\nIn the middle of the lake are two towers which provide zip line rides across the lake on the weekends.  On the east side of the lake there is a lake view amphitheater where shows and events can be put on. \\n\\nThe park is fairly easy to find with routes off Av. de la Juventud near the Fashion Mall and near the intersection of Av. de la Juventud and Blvd Antonio Ortiz Mena. If coming from the hotels or fashion mall, you can take Av Politenicnico Nacional at the south end of the mall and follow it west, look for the Carl\\'s Jr restaurant to know where to turn. Stay on the right side of Av. Politenicnico National and it will flow into Logrono Calle which will wind around the gated communities and deposit you on the side of the lake. There are places for you to park your car on the street in parking spaces facing the lake. Next you can hop over the rail and then walk down a slight hill and onto the 6.5 km track. Once at the track, turn left and head south along the track to the Family monument or right if you want to continue for 5kms around the circle. Please note that if you continue around the circle, there are not bathrooms for at least 4 to 5 kms. See the attached map.\\n\\nIf you are coming from the Eastside or Historic Centre of Chihuahua, I found traveling down Blvd Antonio Ortiz Mena to Av. de la Juventud to be the easiest route. Once you intersect with Av. de la Juventud, get into the frontage road as you come to the overpass and look for signs of La Salle University and Presa el Rejon. You should turn right onto Av. Prol Tecfilo Borurda and follow the avenue till it tells you to turn for La Salle University. After the turn, stay right and follow the small sign and street to Presa el Rejon entrance. The Family monument should be in front of you and you can park along the street. Normally in the afternoon there are lines of cars parked. See map attached.\\n\\nThis is a great time for citizens of Chihuahua and tourists as well and should be a part of any stay.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Parque Metropolitano Presa el Rejon", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/02/44/85/parque-metropolitano.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Chihuahua", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "31020", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Catedral_de_Chihuahua-Chihuahua_Northern_Mexico": {"672244864": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Historic and lovely.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g1028202-d8129352-Reviews-Catedral_de_Chihuahua-Chihuahua_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/f9/68/f4/getlstd-property-photo.jpg", "datePublished": "May 7, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "As most Mexican Cathedrals are, this one is ornate and well kept.  worth a visit.

I walked here from another museum.  A lot of local places to eat on the way. The house itself will mesmerize you upon seeing it from the outside! It is a restored and lighter version of the 60s tv show The Munsters with Ed Guinn. I had visited before but it was before I started writing for Trip Advisor. Upon entering and paying the small fee, I requested to leave my shopping bag at the front. I really do NOt know if there is a guided tour or not. This is one of a few museums to offer bilingual descriptions of the rooms for those few English speaking tourists. One of the workers here told me the last person to live here was a woman named Eliza, but she had to vacate the house because she could not afford it and somehow it ended up in the university\\'s hands\\n\\nThis house is a must for Mexican history buffs like myself who like old architecture, furniture, and more! You can view the unique work that artisans used to create on the high ceilings, walls, and really all over this house. Just describing each room would be like writing a book. As I viewed each room, I imagined how life was like at the turn of the century. There was a room with artwork displayed but I really did not pay too much attention to it. After I viewed the house, another worker told me that there is a small caf\\u00e9 in the backyard. I was going to go outside anyway. I was amused by the animals that the gardener created on the bushes especially the koala!\\n\\nThe personnel at the museum caf\\u00e9 was very friendly. At this time, I really wanted tea and not coffee. Omar told me that he just had green tea, but I said that it was fine. The tea was brewed from leaves and NOt a bag. There were other little snacks available for your sweet tooth. I also saw some cups and t shirts for sale but my bag was heavy enough already. When I left, I meant to ask to see if I could see the basement, but there were some other visitors asking questions; I was also tired and totally forgot to ask.

Because of the buildings shape, which is similar to a seed, the building was called Museo Semilla or in English, the Seed Museum. This facility\\'s true purpose is to plant the seed of science, knowledge and information in the minds of children in hopes that they will make it their own and let the knowledge grow. \\n\\nThe museum is split in two different sections, with Space and Natural History on one side and Science, Geography and Geology on the other. Here in the Miami area of Florida, we are blessed with two really great children\\'s museums. I must admit that Museo Semilla is on par with these American museums and is many ways it\\'s interaction is better. \\n\\nThe Museum starts with a dizzying trip to the moon across a bridge with a revolving circular mirror and light show used to create a feeling of flying through space. Next is a model of the lunar surface, complete with a walking space man, which was quite well done, and almost like a Capricorn One mockup. There are wonderful NASA models of Apollo 11 and the space shuttle as well as a mock up of a module from the international space station. In the space station mock up, kids can move the giant robotic arm or practice sleeping while standing up in a harness like astronauts. All the while, a drifting Apollo Astronaut looks on them from the ceiling above. \\n\\nIn the Dinosaur section, kids are shown fossils from Dinosaurs found in the Chihuahua area. There is also a bone yard where future scientists can seek their own Dinosaur finds. There is a working farm, where the children can milk cows, watch chickens laying eggs and pet a horse.\\n\\nIn the natural Earth Section, there is a working model of the Planet Earth, which allow children to slide through it\\'s crust and peer into the Earth\\'s core. There is a cave the kids can walk through complete with bats and dinosaur fossils on the walls. There is a working volcano, which allows children to be inside the cone while the volcano erupts with full sound and visual lava flowing. In a working model of Plate tectonics, children can walk across a visual map of the world\\'s seven major plates which move when stepped on.  \\n\\nIn the next area, we get to real science with exhibits which feature Newton\\'s theory of gravity, a working Van Der Graaff\\'s generator, which make your hair stand on end; a working Tesla Coil, which powers lights as it runs; a working bed of nails the children can lay on; and an great working model of pulley systems similar to those found in modern elevators. If that was not enough to get you excited, there is a working gyroscope which the kids can ride and if your not careful lose their lunch at the same time. There is so much hands on science that you cannot help but be impressed and the children cannot help but learn. \\n\\nIt took us about 2 and half hours to go through the whole museum and I must say that it was really great fun. \\n\\nAdmission will cost you 40 pesos or about $2.75 US for adults and 35 pesos or about $2.10 US for children and seniors. The cost is well worth the investment as the kids will be thoroughly entertained. \\n\\nThe museum is open Tuesday through Friday from 9:00am till 5:00pm and Saturday to Sunday from 11:00am till 6:00pm.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Museo Semilla", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/0c/10/bb/museo-semilla.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Progreso #1201 Col.

However, he usually went accompanied by a number of bodyguards, and this time he went with only four associates. On his drive home, in a 1919 Dodge roadster that can be viewed in the Museum, someone shouted out &quot;Viva Villa!&quot; After that, seven riflemen appeared and fired more than forty bullets into the car. Nine bullets hit Villa; four went into his head. He died immediately.

In 1981, when she became ill and too advanced in age to maintain the house, she made an offer that when she died the house would be donated to the city provided that they turned it into a museum in honor of Villa. The Ministry of Defense accepted the offer. Because of the poor state in which it was received many restorations had to be made by the National Institute of Anthropology and History.\\n\\nThe house re-opened on November 17, 1982 under the name of the name &quot;Historical Museum of the Revolution&quot;. The office and music room are used to display the personal belongings of Villa. There are photographs and other personal belongings of Villa\\'s era. One exhibit is the car he was traveling in with his escort on the day he was assassinated.\\n\\nOn the first floor of the museum are utensils and furniture that were commonly used by the Villa Corral family.\\n\\nOn the second floor are five showrooms and the Hall of Arms where weapons Francisco Villa used in many combat missions while part of the Northern Division. Some the weapons that are displayed are revolvers, rifles, machine guns, cavalry sabers, baskets and leather cases with brass. There is a photograph of Rafael Mendoza, a native of Maderas, Chihuahua, who during the Mexican Revolution invented the first machine gun air cooled 250 rounds per minute.\\n\\nIn one of the showcases known as the Tragic Room people are able to witness the death of General Villa. In the showcase there is a display that shows the map of the route Villa took before his assassination; also on display are photographs and his death mask, taken three hours after his death\\n\\nOverall it was an excellent museum with much to see and learn about the history of Mexico.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Historical Museum of the Mexican Revolution", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/f1/76/5f/photo2jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle 10a.

He\\'s an icon. You can readily find Pancho Villa t-shirts, magnets, postcards and the like for sale.\\n\\nThese buildings were one of his houses. The museum contains a lot of the artifacts from the period. When you come here, you can find the car he was shot in, the table where they signed the agreements at the Convention of Aguascalientes and his death mask. In addition, there are also beautiful murals and room after room of photos with captions in Spanish and poorly translated English.\\n\\nThis can all be seen for the nominal price of 10 pesos, a bargain. No guide available. No movie in English or Spanish. Nothing like that.\\n\\nIf you contrast this park with a park dedicated to a minor American founding father - say Friendship Hill in Pennsylvania for Albert Gallatin - you\\'re going to be mystified as to why this place isn\\'t made into a bigger deal than it is. Gallatin is nowhere as important to American history as Villa is to modern Mexican history. You come here, you get no clear picture of the events of the Mexican revolution. You get no clear sense of what made Pancho Villa the commander he was. No sense of the times. You can\\'t buy books to read about the man or his time. It\\'s like people get distracted by Villa\\'s brash, extroverted personality and the big sombrero and don\\'t see the political cunning and ruthlessness that made his men put trust in him to right the wrongs.\\n\\nHistory is a collection of stories. This museum does a poor job of telling them.  Pancho Villa is about one of the most fascinating characters you can find. If I hadn\\'t read Villa and Zapata: A History of the Mexican Revolution by Frank McLynn I would have no idea what was possible.\\n\\nThe museum is administered by the Mexican army and soldiers aren\\'t curators. The only reason I gave this place 3/5 is that the artifacts are such a big deal. Please, people! Do more with this place! It\\'s potentially a treasure! Hire a real curator who can relate the legacy of the revolution to others young and old, foreign and domestic!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Historical Museum of the Mexican Revolution", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/f1/76/5f/photo2jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle 10a.

This is by far the best shopping mall in the Chihuahua and it is about the size of a mid-level American mall in the United States, like Sunland Park Mall in El Paso, TX or Aventura Mall in the Miami area. There are four anchor stores which include Liverpool, Sears, Ace Hardware and Sanborn\\'s. The Liverpool store is very much like a Macy\\'s or high end Dillard\\'s in the United States. The Sears store here has a much greater selection of inventory than in the US and is paired with Pier One to provide a better selection. The Ace Hardware store is more of a furniture and home d\\u00e9cor store than the local hardware stores here in states. Sanborn is a high end, Mexican chain store which is part department store, newsstand and high end electronics shop. Sanborn also hosts a sit down restaurant with a good buffet which is a good place to grab lunch or dinner. \\n\\nA true joy and great value is the Cinepolis Movie theatre on the second floor. The Cinepolis houses 12 screens, 8 regular and 4 VIP. If you join the Club Cinepolis at the theatre for free, it enables you to see first run movies quite affordably. With the card, you get 2 for one movies on Tuesdays. Matinees before 2:00pm are around $2 US.  If you have 4 people in your party, you can use to card to get everyone in for only 100 pesos or about 6 dollars and 70 cents before 2pm. Incredible right! For those taking your wife or date out, consider the VIP seating which provides complete dinner table service, including beer, wine and cocktails directly from your large comfortable lounge chairs while you watch the movie . The VIP Area cost around $7.50 per person and is a great splurge. The movies are all first runs either in English with Spanish subtitle or all dubbed into Spanish. \\n\\nThere is a regular styled food court on the second floor opposite of the Cinepolis. Here you will find Mc Donald\\'s, Burger King, Subway, Dominos and several Mexican and Asian fast food places. The Mexican People love their ice cream and frozen yogurt shops. The mall has no less than 5 of these shops selling ice cream by the cone or ounce. \\n\\nThere are also several sit down restaurants on the first floor next to Ace Hardware. I greatly enjoyed the ComicX restaurant, which is a hamburger restaurant styled on the characters from Marvel and DC Comic books and is similar to Planet Hollywood. \\nPlease see my review. There is also a Chili\\'s and Wing Stop for those wanting additional choices.\\n\\nFor those seeking to buy or upgrade their cell phones, the mall, by far, has the best options in Chihuahua with a huge Tel-cel store, Moviestar and several others companies to choice from. You can also book your next flight out at the Interjet ticket office. \\n\\nThere are also many Hair and beauty salons, nail shops and dress stores to entertain the ladies in your group.\\n\\nThere is a children\\'s play area at the end of mall for parents with children who get a little restless from shopping. There is also an arcade and Piccolo Mondo, which is childcare facility that will watch the kids while you shop for a fee. There is also Julio Cepeda, which is toy store, and pet store to entertain the kids too.\\n\\nOne really great find is the Gonwill bookstore on the second floor above the ComicX restaurant. Here you will find the best selections of books in English and Spanish for the whole family. It is very close to a Barnes and Nobles here in the States with similar pricing.\\n\\nPlease note that there is a 10 peso an hour fee for parking you car at the Fashion Mall which is payable at the kiosks near the main entrance. There is also bus service from the central/Downtown area of Chihuahua on the RC-02 Panamericana Mirador route which takes about 30 minutes to go to downtown. The bus costs 6 pesos one way and is the most cost effect way around town. There you can connect to the main North-South Vivabus line to key areas and hotels around the City. See route photos. There is also taxi stands which will run you about 45 to 120 pesos each way depending on how many sections you cross on the tariff map. I have include a couple photos of the taxi rate tariff map posted at the mall if it helps.  \\n\\nIf you are staying a one of the several Hotels next to the mall, Holiday Inn, Staybridge, Hampton Inn or Wingate, just walk over to the Mall which is less than a quarter mile.\\n\\nEnjoy the shopping!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Fashion Mall", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/13/07/e7/fashion-mall.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Periferico de la Juventud 3400 Fracc.

The function of the round houses were to provide locomotives minor repairs and maintenance, inspection, procurement, accommodation service. The Round Houses consisted of three key elements: a turntable, buildings and courtyards, annexes, which housed the services required for its operation. The turntable enabled one man to turn a heavy locomotive engine onto different tracks which would send it through routes in Mexico. \\n\\nToday, the La Casa Redonda serves as a locomotive museum which tells the story of Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico railroads during the last hundred years. It also provides a wealth of train models and information which allows you and your children to understand how locomotives and railroads which used and maintained. \\n\\nA large part of the museum is also a wonderful art gallery which is currently hosting a grand exhibit of French Art and posters by Toulouse Lautrec and other Mexican and world artists. There are also art appreciation classes for adults and children held several times throughout the year. The &quot;Nights at La Casa Redonda&quot; series present musical concerts and exhibitions throughout the year as well. \\n\\nI found the 15 pesos entry fee, about a dollar US, a great value to see the many wonderful models, history and the original Toulouse Lautrec art.
