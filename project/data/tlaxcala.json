The name comes from the Ocotl\\u00e1n hill, on the top of which the Sanctuary is perched. The church was built after the appearance of the Virgin Mary to a local countryman in 1541, but the present building dates from the 18th century. The church is extolled as one of the best examples of Mexican Baroque architecture; actually, the interior is absolutely wonderful, whereas the exterior looks rather \\u201cpop\\u201d and perplexing. Anyway, the church is definitely worth a visit. Plan to stay about half an hour.\\n\\nThe interior of the building has a very simple structure (a nave and a small transept), but its decoration is extraordinarily rich and beautiful, actually one of the richest I have seen in Mexico. The apse and the two transepts are fully covered (wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling) with Churrigueresque altars, sculpted and gilded. The walls of the nave are taken up by 6 enormous paintings encased in molded and gilded frames. Any other available space is filled with ornaments. The whole appears harmonious and well-proportioned; at the same time, it is absolutely impressive. Looking at this interior justifies the trip to Tlaxcala.\\n\\nThe exterior is eye-catching but, in certain sense, odd and perplexing. Actually, the structure of the building is very elegant, but a questionable use of colours debases the brilliant work of the architects. The fa\\u00e7ade, profusely sculpted in Churrigueresque style, was smothered with a layer of white plaster, and the same fate occurred to the summit of the beautiful bell-towers. The sense of drama, typical of the baroque scenarios, has completely been lost, and the fa\\u00e7ade now looks kinda a gigantic wedding-cake adorned with white figurines. I have been told that this unfortunate arrangement was made out of necessity, since the fa\\u00e7ade was not sculpted, but fabricated with juxtaposed bricks, like a &quot;lego&quot;; the assemblage was then plastered and finally whitewashed. \\n\\nThe sanctuary is on the top of a hill, less than 1 mile from the centre. It is possible to go there on foot, but it\\'s more practical to take one of the frequent micro-buses marked Ocotl\\u00e1n, (6.50 Pesos = 0.47 US $); they will drop you at the church.

We were drawn to this small Mexican city primarily by the report in the Lonely Planet Guide, Mexico City, published in 2008.  As far as I can tell, this is still the benchmark travel guide for this city in English.   A couple articles on the internet backed up this point of view, so I thought it important to file an alternative report.\\n\\n    In the LP guide Daniel Schecter writes of a small city with a well preserved colonial center.  The implication is that the administrative center of Mexico has moved on, but the colonial buildings of Tlaxcala are representative of a larger presence two hundred years ago.  I\\u2019m here to tell you that the vice-regal administrative buildings are smaller than those in Coyocan, sort of squat and unimpressive, albeit in a peaceful sort of way.  \\n     We were seduced into staying on the zocalo.  While it is tranquil much of the time, and has its fair share of greenery, compared to other Mexican towns, this zocalo is no reason per se to spend a night in Talaxcala.  We spent three!  By comparison, Coyocan and Puebla each boast a zocalo that will take your breath away.  In Talaxcala expect no grand fountains, amazing plantings, monumental churches or other palatial structures on the zocalo.  \\n     The zocalo is an integral part of the community, though.  It hosts exercise class in the morning and on Friday night we danced to a live band with the older seniors by the central gazebo.\\n     The local museums are pathetic.  Unless you consider three small, poorly executed Frida Kahlo paintings a treasure to be sought.\\n     \\n    One of the main reasons we came to Tlaxcala was a quest for the pilgrimage church.   The Virgen de Ocotlan appeared here in 1541 to a Tlaxcala (Indian) named Juan Diego Bernardino.   Little finds it way into the English speaking press regarding this encounter other than (erroneously) the Basilica de Ocotlan is located on the site of this meeting.  Why did she appear?  What did she say to Juan Diego?   And why is this encounter less important than the one that occurred (ten years earlier) on a hill named Guadalupe on the north shore of Lake Texcoco?\\n      On our first full day we set out to visit this pilgrimage church.  Sr Schecter says it is one of \\u201cMexico\\u2019s most spectacular.\\u201d  I was pumped.  \\n\\n     In deference to my sweetie\\u2019s hurt foot, we took a taxi up to the Basilica de Ocotlan.  Immediately things went south.  The taxi fare was 40 P.  I attempted to pay with a 100 (about 9 USD).  No hay cambio.  In fact, none of the little shops that sold food and knick knacks were willing to change this small note \\u2026even if I bought something.  Bizarre and not exactly a harbinger of good things to come.  The driver trusted us to pay him when we returned to the hotel.  Jose is OK.\\n\\n     So we visited the church.  Our first impression was, \\u201cThis is the most beautiful church?!!  NOT!\\u201d   The outside is quite unimpressive\\u2026it could be mistaken for a gazillion other Mexican churches.  The single vault boasts a tall gilded altar and a similarly gilded chapel, but nothing seemed all that impressive.  The Virgin Mary above the altar and behind glass may be the virgin statue that was found in the famous encounter in 1541, but this is not entirely clear.  I love old churches.  See some of my other reviews.  This church was simply unlovable.  \\n\\n     We tried to walk around the church to get a view of the supposedly lovely exterior and had a near death experience with a garbage truck, all to no avail.  There are no  good views of the church from the exterior.  \\n      Boy, were we disappointed.  I\\u2019m not exactly Roman Catholic, but I believe in God and get a very special feeling in most churches.  Not this one.  Que triste.\\n\\n     So we exited the main gate and the Redoubtable SKG and I began the descent to the centro.  After one block, we encountered a choice in path.  A larger dusty road to the right appeared to be the one we had taken in the taxi, but a smaller road, that headed straight down the steep hill had a sign pointing to a church.  \\u201cA few churches in the centro,\\u201d I thought to myself.  At this early morning crossroads there was a lady washing her sidewalk while her elderly father supervised.  We asked directions in our best broken Espanol,  She recommended the smaller steeper road straight ahead.  \\n     A block down this precipitous calle we had a chance to confirm her information with a lady sweeping her driveway.  At the bottom of the long block we noted a sign directing traffic to the left.  Still, our consultant said, \\u201cDerecha.\\u201d  with the appropriate hand signal.  The road, with a wonderful set of wide steps, meandered steeply for another two blocks, with good views of the city, such as it is.  Towards the bottom we happened upon a single blue and white ceramic dome.  \\n\\n    A few steps further and we found ourselves at a small domed chapel.  A plaque on the outside informed us that the chapel of El Pocito is at the place where the Virgin appeared to Juan Diego.   The Tlaxcalas were suffering a terrible epidemic and Mary directed the indio to a well whose blessed water would save the tribe.  She also directed Juan Diego to notify the church authorities and search for a sign in the nearby forest.  The priests pried into a tree and recovered a statue of the virgin that may be the one in the basilica. \\n    \\n   A smaller chapel had existed on this spot, but recently the local Obispo had this tidy structure erected.  The murals inside were painted by local Tlaxcala Indians.  And the water from the well is there in plastic garbage cans for you to enjoy.  \\n   I could barely believe our good fortune.  It was as if the Holy Spirit had a hand in bringing us to this chapel that sings with the truth of His presence. Unbeknowst to us, we had been following the steps created for the pilgrims who visit the basilica and then the chapel and the well!   The murals, picturing Mary, the Indians and conquistadores are alive with color.  And I tingled with joy as I anointed myself from the spring water.   \\n   Cups are provided.  On a later visit I sat with three Mexicanos of about my age.  One drank a full glass.  So I plucked up my courage and quaffed an ounce or so.  It may have changed my life.  Who knows? \\n    \\n    Below the chapel is a park run by the ayuntamiento.  I am an out of the closet bird watcher and had hoped to see some birds here in Tlaxcala, which is safe enough to walk around in, even in the small wooded corners.   Up to this time we had seen no birds of merit.  Here we saw three species of wintering North American warblers.   On later visits I saw a few more good Mexican birds.  There are benches in the park and it is peaceful place to rest.\\n    A walk down the hill from the basilica is recommended.

The interior of the church was restored thanks to its patron, the artist Rodulfo Morelos. Both inside and out, the church is certainly the centerpiece of Ocotlan. Friday is market day in Ocotlan. As I have been to a number of the local town markets in the Valley of Oaxaca, the one here is one of my favorites. The sights, sounds, and smells of a traditional market are all present.  From fruit and vegetables, to housewares and crafts, you can find it all in the fairly compact central square area. Most interesting are the people selling turkeys and other poultry. Many opportunities exist to have lunch or a snack at the market. Take a local bus to and from Ocotlan. It\\'s an easy trip and you can combine it with stops at the black pottery village (San Bartolo) or San Martin where many of the alebrijes (carved wood fantasy animals) are fabricated.

In 500 square metres he depicted the complete history of Tlaxcala, from the pre-colonial times up to the 20th century.\\n\\nThe murals are on the walls and the vault of the entrance hall, on the walls and the vault of the staircase leading to the second floor, and on part of the gallery of the second floor. Hundreds (if not thousands) of mythical and historical personages are represented, together with the most relevant facts of the Tlaxcala history and the uses and costumes of the primitive &quot;nahua&quot; population. Below the murals Xochitiotzin painted a number of cartouches containing detailed explanations of what he intended to represent. There are 77 cartouches of this kind, in Spanish language. In addition, the main historical personages hold in their hands a parchment where the feats of their lives are described. On the whole, this cycle of paintings amounts to a veritable and complete history course. \\n\\nDue to the complexity of the representation, it is not easy for a hurried tourist to understand all the details. Some familiarity with the Tlaxcala and the Mexican history is required for interpreting many scenes, and adequate knowledge of the Spanish language is needed for reading the cartouches and the parchments. It may help hiring a guide, and it may also help taking pictures to be viewed and analysed later on, at home; but the light is rather dim and taking good pictures requires quality equipment and great care.\\n\\nThe above difficulties should not dissuade the visitor. The paintings are absolutely enjoyable, the colour palette used by Xochitiotzin is enchanting, and many scenes can be easily understood, especially those representing the pre-columbine life and those involving well known personages (like Hern\\u00e1n Cortez, the Malinche, the politicians of the Mexican revolution, etc.). The style of Xochitiotzin is very different from the style of the other great Mexican muralists of the 20th century (Rivera, Orozco, Siqueiros, Bustos, Leal, etc.), since a great influence of the pre-columbine aesthetic standards is felt in his work. \\n\\nViewing these murals is enough reason for visiting Tlaxcala. Tlaxcala is only 40 kilometres away from Puebla and is easily reached by public transportation. Buses and microbuses leave Puebla from the &quot;Tlaxcala bus terminal&quot;, at 11th Nord and 12th Poniente; they drop you 3 blocks away from the Tlaxcala Z\\u00f3calo; the trip takes about 1\\u00bd hours.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Murals of the Government Palace", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/90/80/ec/murals-of-the-government.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "At the Zocalo", "addressLocality": "Tlaxcala", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "255240734": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful work of Art", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499425-d4909624-Reviews-Murals_of_the_Government_Palace-Tlaxcala_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/90/80/ec/murals-of-the-government.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "They told me, that the tlaxcalteca painter took 20 years\\nto finish this beautiful work, you can get a tourist guide that explains the meaning of each part of the murals.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Murals of the Government Palace", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/90/80/ec/murals-of-the-government.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "At the Zocalo", "addressLocality": "Tlaxcala", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "244869788": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A must see mural of the history of Mexico", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499425-d4909624-Reviews-Murals_of_the_Government_Palace-Tlaxcala_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/90/80/ec/murals-of-the-government.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The large murals of the Tlaxala Palacio de Gobierno (bordering the Zocalo) are not only beautiful but serve as a comprehensive history of Mexico.
