The options in this park are truly inspiring. After viewing the exhibits at the Visitor Center you can choose between 4 trails-3 have placards about the flora and fauna.

The silence of this park, the variety of colors and geology is very impressive. \\n\\nThere is another loop road down the road a bit. That road is dusty and lonely and really worth it if you are in the mood for a longer trip to the remote desert.\\n\\nWe stayed at Puerto Penasco and love that town for the beach and seafood.

Minimum time needed is 2.5 hours and that\\'s pushing it. \\nI strongly suggest packing a lunch and afternoon snack along with a good supply of water... 2 to 3 litters per person if you like. Dress in layers and wear comfortable shoes and clothes. \\nThe desert views are some of the best I\\'ve seen. We had lush green brush and a forest of cacti surrounding us at times. There are several pullouts along the drive, but this is not a place for off reading fun. At these pullouts you\\'ll find information about the Flora and Fauna, the weather of the area, the geology and volcanic activity.\\nIt\\'s mostly a single direction, one lane road. The first major stop is the giant crater left from a collapsed lava bubble. It\\'s interesting, but nicer if you are into hiking.... It\\'s not a long hike, less than two kilometers round trip. The day we were there the wind was very gusty and cold so we just wanted to get back in the car. The second big stop is similar to the unknowing eye though the surrounding terrain is completely different ...I imagine the geological aspects are also different, but we were more interested in trying to exit the park before the gates were closed and locked... so we did very little exploring. \\nWe should have come early, but we thought we\\'d do a late picnic lunch and just do a bit of driving. We didn\\'t know that the road was a one-way loop and would take so long just to drive. We were under prepared for our day to this park. The visitor center that is just off hwy about 10 miles outside of Puerto Penasco was closed this day, it was our original destination, but we opted to drive the distance. We checked in at the gate around 12:30 and we exited at 4:40... We didn\\'t hike, we did have our lunch at the first pullout but stayed in the car because it was so cold and windy that day. The road was rugged at times, I\\'m a country boy so no big deal... my wife\\'s a city girl and let\\'s just say it was not a pleasant ride for her. It\\'s fun for the first 30 minutes, but then the drive can be very tiring. Washboard roads, many rutts and dips, soft sand and the occasional puddle are expected.

It is the closest real beach to Phoenix. It sounded like a fascinating place to relax by the ocean.\\n \\nIn talking some of our AZ friends who have driven there, they had to watch out for the stop signs (ALTO) as they could be on either side of the road and at a lower than normal range of vision. They also suggested bringing Mexican Pesos.\\n\\nWe lucked out as there was a cancellation on Sue Sinclair\\u2019s travel tour \\u2013 New  Year\\u2019s Eve in Puerto Penasco. Having Jerry, the driver from Aboard American, and Diane, the travel guide from Sue Sinclair made the trip very enjoyable. \\n\\nWe learned about the creosote bush in the Sonoran desert, saw the growth of plants along the washes, and saw the unique organ pipe cactus.  Lukeville is the border town. It is just South of the Organ Pipe National Monument.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe found out that Rocky Point even had an Al Capone connection. He partnered one of the hotels and casinos with Thomas Childs. Eventually they destroyed this because of political unrest. Some creative Mexican businessman opened Capone\\u2019s Pizza and Beer (not on site)\\n \\nThe present Puerto Penasco even has a Sam\\u2019s Club (Walmart) and large grocery store (Bodega Aurrera) just before you enter the main part of town.\\n\\nThe next morning we went to \\u201cRodeo Drive\\u201d or \\u201cShacks Fifth Avenue\\u201d . It is about 4 blocks long. One can enjoy negotiating with owners over purses, clothing, \\u201clemon pots\\u201d, souvenirs, pottery, metalwork, and silver jewelry in a quieter shopping environment than the market area. USD was the currency the vendors bartered in.\\n \\nOur bus then went to the Malecon Market area in the Old Port. As we had quite a few metal work purchases (Lightweight), we returned with bus the the resort.\\n \\nWe decided to walk west alongside the beach at low tide. A couple of shells found their way into our pockets. We walked by the RV resort. Then we stopped at the next two condos: The Sonoran Sky and Puerta Privada. The Privada\\u2019s model suite suggested we need to win the lottery as the suite was finished with class. We imagined the hardship of waking up to waves crashing the beach\\n\\nIn our initial research the next \\u201ccondo\\u201d Las Palomas Beach Resort was recommended by Trip Advisor but we did not walk that far. To return we thought we would walk on the pavement back to the resort. With no sidewalks, it was a delight as every third vehicle seemed to be an ATV roaring past us. The distance was three times longer than if we had returned by beach.\\n\\nFor the last day in 2017 we cabbed it to Malecon Market. (We were told to always barter your price before going - around $2USD each was the going rate). We got off in front of Mary\\u2019s.\\n \\nThe Viagra at $2.99 a tablet at the Farmcia may have been a good price we were interested in the ambience of the Old Port. We strolled through the shops but nothing really attracted us along Circumvalacion y o Malecon Kino.\\n\\nWe stopped at a square where there was a bust of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murietta and a Penasco sign. We then walked down the stairs to see the statue of \\u201cEl Camaronero\\u201d, the fisherman riding a shrimp.\\n\\nWe stopped to enjoy a peaceful time on the bench overlooking the Sea of Cortez. We listened to music coming from the Satisfied Frog restaurant, watched the seagulls and pelicans fly by, and observed the different types of boats on the ocean. We had heard of people getting a glimpse of dolphins swimming\\n \\nPuerto Penasco is a fishing village. Therefore we decided to have seafood for lunch and we wanted to enjoy the ambience of being Oceanside. Tekila Bar and Restaurant had great food and a great view from the second floor.  We had garlic shrimp and clams.\\n \\nA fascinating feature of our package is that part of your luggage was to include a cooler. We stopped off at the fish market to load up with shrimp and fish. One is allowed 50 pounds of shrimp to bring cross the border.\\n\\nThe vendor recommended to us was Mr. Shrimp run by the Gomez family. We bought 5 pounds of shrimp at $8 USD a pound ($19 at Costco) and some flounder. The next day we savored a fresh shrimp meal.\\n \\nOur guide did not know if the UETA duty free shop in Lukeville was open on January 1. So we purchased a 1 litre bottle of Kahlua at Bodega Aurrera on the outskirts of Rocky Point. One of the advantages of being on a bus tour was that we were not pestered by the gauntlet of vendors selling their wares upon exiting the border at Lukeville.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa Bonita Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/75/a7/bc/20190212-120614-largejpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Playa Bonita Beach", "addressLocality": "Puerto Penasco", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "546655000": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Great time", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153981-d541647-Reviews-Playa_Bonita_Beach-Puerto_Penasco_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/75/a7/bc/20190212-120614-largejpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Perfect beach to relax, hang out, get souvenirs, lay on the sand..

The beach was clean and well maintained.  There were vendors walking up and down the beach which I enjoy, but I know some people hate.  Just say &quot;No Gracias&quot; and they are gone.  There are massage tables, banana boat rides, horse back rides, jet ski rentals.  People selling toys for kids, bags, hats, jewlry, etc...  TIP:  Try one of the mangos for $3, they are so juicy messy, full of spices and fantastic!   This beach has a tide like I have never seen.  It will literately drop and raise about 80 yards leaving a fantastic tide pool where my kids caught hermit crabs, little fish, bigger crabs, and even a jelly fish.  They spent hours each day looking for critters in the late afternoon.  TIP:  make sure to bring a little clear cage (crabitat) for the kids to keep their critters...  mine loved it.  Also bring beach toys for them.  TIP:  When the tide drops the exposed   rocks and coral are sharp be sure to bring beach shoes.  My feet got so torn up!   \\nThe tide begins to rise around 9:00am, by 11:00 it is almost all the way up.  In the evening the tide probably begins to fall around 3:00.

Next in a greatroom style layout the with the living room , bar, and 2 queen size beds . left to the bed room 2 more queen beds dresser , and all in all casual but done but very Mexico ! We opened the windows and you could hear the ocean waves , the patio is right on the beach , The night could not have been better ( i thought ) ? We brought food , and grilled on the patio looking at the ocean , the moon was full ,the fish were jumping WOW just too perfect . From there it just got better , saturday we rented horses and took a ride on the beach about 5min drive from our location , from this house in 5min you can rent Quads,atv , fishing trips , night clubs , cafe\\', watch sealions , grey whales and much much more .

La vida loca!  Perched precariously alongside a rocky hill at the water\\'s edge, Cholla Bay was once a rugged outback for pioneering Americans who didn\\'t mind living in a remote and dusty dirt-bike colony off on bumpy roads and 10 miles from town.  Although &quot;La Choya&quot; now has electricity and TV, many still live off the grid.  Stores and services are very few out here and I recommend you gas up before coming.  The best route is from Downtown Rocky Point along Hotel Row and onto wide  &quot;dirt expressways&quot; starting near The Reef club.\\n\\nYou will have to be quite tolerant of ATVs and other off-road get-ups going to and from La Choya although most drive safely.  Things can get out of hand during Spring Break or other holiday periods when a less-desirable &quot;yahoo&quot; kind of tourist or visitor seems to take over.  Nevertheless, try to make your way to an historic &quot;Arizona Institution&quot;, JJ\\'s Cantina, the center of social life here.  The view from JJ\\'s waterfront terrace is worth a stop but you should catch Trip Advisor\\'s reviews of JJ\\'s to learn about his food and drink options.  \\n\\nBottom line: The variety of housing types and the twists and turns of local &quot;catwalk&quot; streets are fascinating and represent the choices people here live with for the sake of remoteness and a sense of relative freedom from the stresses of la vida loca.

There is a security check point as you enter, but they will just wave at you as you pass through.\\n\\nIf you\\'re hungry stop at Xochitl\\'s (pronounced &quot;so-cheese&quot;) and enjoy the best chili rellenos on the planet. If you are thirsty or if you just want to get a t-shirt stop by JJ\\'s Cantina. Both are on the main road as you enter Cholla Bay!\\n\\nWhen you leave, be sure to stop at Wrecked at the Reef for more drinks and cool t-shirts.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cholla Bay", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/2d/cd/84/cholla-bay.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Cholla Bay", "addressLocality": "Puerto Penasco", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "128526840": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "authentic", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153981-d541622-Reviews-Cholla_Bay-Puerto_Penasco_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/2d/cd/84/cholla-bay.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "more authentic and less touristic than old town Penasco - great sand dollar hunting and clamming when tide is out - very shallow shelf margin when tide is in so save for kids to play in the water - town has reasonably priced and SAFE restaurants", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cholla Bay", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/2d/cd/84/cholla-bay.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Cholla Bay", "addressLocality": "Puerto Penasco", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "55417006": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Absolutely worth the drive", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153981-d541622-Reviews-Cholla_Bay-Puerto_Penasco_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/2d/cd/84/cholla-bay.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is a most unique village with a mixture of the very wealthy and the very poor.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cholla Bay", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/2d/cd/84/cholla-bay.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Cholla Bay", "addressLocality": "Puerto Penasco", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "15133015": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Wow!

Housewares, clothing, interesting garden ornaments, etc.  The place really hums when the tour busses pull in!\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cholla Mall", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/a9/5e/eb/fun-shopping.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Cholla Bay Rd", "addressLocality": "Puerto Penasco", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Old_Port-Puerto_Penasco_Northern_Mexico": {"676844531": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Healthy nightlife ", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153981-d541638-Reviews-Old_Port-Puerto_Penasco_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1d/d5/4e/street-view.jpg", "datePublished": "May 27, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We visited over Memorial weekend.

Buy a sealed bottle of water before you go buy fish.  Remember &quot;a pint a pound the world around?&quot;; well, &quot;a liter a kilo&quot; also holds true.\\nWhen you make your selection, pull out your water bottle and place it on the scale.  If it\\'s a half liter bottle, it should weigh half a kilo.\\nIt\\'s at this point the sales guy usually smiles and says something like &quot;oh, hold on ... here\\'s the REAL scale!&quot;.  The price will probably also go up a buck a pound; but paying a true price for true weight has always been OK with me.\\n\\n2.  Skip the Malecon altogether and go to Productos de Mariscos a block or two east of the Burger King.  This is the wholesale house where the fish stalls are buying most of their stuff to begin with.  At the stalls, you are usually buying defrosted shrimp that will disintergrate if you refreeze them.\\nHere you will get them solid frozen and they will stay that way until you get home.  The weights are true, all the shrimp are the size advertised, and if you specify blue or brown, they are all that way.\\nBut don\\'t skip the flounder fillets or whole fish.  Absolutely awesome.

Plan to practice your haggling skills and be willing to walk away to get the best prices. We were there May 2016 and the weather was amazing! However, we have also gone in July before and it gets quiet hot mid-afternoon.

I will continue looking for a vendor  that is honest and report it here. \\n    The rest of old port is awesome. The vendors are all just trying to make some money. You can negotiate a price on whatever you want. Restaurants are all  petty good too.  It\\'s unfortunate the fish vendors ruin it  for everyone else.

Most everyone speaks English however they are always glad to offer Americanos (and Canadians) a &quot;Mucho gusto&quot; and help with your Espa\\u00f1ol.  My main advice is to simply slow down, take your time and enjoy your visit.\\n\\nParking and access is a bit challenging but patience pays off.  There is considerable free parking at the far end of the shopping area.  &quot;The Monk&quot; (That\\'s my TripAdvisor handle) advises you park a block or two back from the main shopping drag known as The Malecon or sea-walk and make your way down there on foot.  Parking near the old Catholic Church is usually easy to find.  Be sure to try a fresh shrimp cocktail or taco.  The stores and vendors all offer basically the same goods but are always open to bartering. Prices are lower as you go back from the seafront.  If you have time, try to arrange a scenic sunset harbor tour.  Keep an open mind and don\\'t let the initial crowds scare you off.\\n\\nBottom line, the Puerto Viejo or Old Port is a colorful and secure area to experience what its like to be a tourist in Old Mexico.

Stay in a luxury resort on Sandy Beach or (recommended) rent a condo or house in Las Palamas (gated community on the beach).  OR, drive 15 min further to Cholla Bay for a more authentic (cheaper and safe) experience.  We went with grandkids ages 4-6 and they loved it.  GREAT beaches in Penasco area but avoid hotels in old town Penasco (&quot;spring break&quot; atmosphere).  Fun clam digging and hunting sand dollars in Cholla Bay.  Restaurants outside the resorts are reasonably priced, safe, and good.  Grocery shopping is fun.  Super fresh shrimp is sold on street corners and at the pier. LOTS of souvenirs.
