I wanted photos of the sunset because we had arrived at about that time the night before and drove all around Avandaro without finding a view of the lake and the gorgeous colors I could see through the trees. Anyway, I was quite pleased with this spot. While there were several signs, there weren\\'t any when it really mattered and we must have asked about 5 locals and turned around at least three times. Apparently, there is a gradual switchback road and a VERY steep road. We spun our wheels 3/4 of the way up the steep road, had to back down and take the road immediately before it that looked like it might be a residential dead end, but wound its way up there (follow the paved road). We almost missed the entry point as it was nestled amongst the houses, but there is a little kiosk and sign with the stone steps that lead up to the peak. It cost 5 pesos per person.  I loved the entire walk up. So picturesque with occasional views out both sides of the peninsula. So many places to explore and rocks to crawl around on. I got my gorgeous sunset pictures and had fun inside one of the caves on the way down. I definitely recommend this as  a spot to hit that doesn\\'t take much time, but will take some effort.

The best day to see Avandaro is on a Monday when they have the &quot;tianguis&quot; (open air market) set up in the central plaza. Get to Avandaro early eat some pancita (menudo) from the tianguis, and head over to the waterfall. There is no charge to visit the waterfall. The area itself is not that large; the walk and waterfall can all be done within an hour or two, which is why I recommend to include the town on the trip. There are horses for rent at the entrance from 150 MXN$ (price is negotiable) they are not guided tours but the trail is pretty easy to follow. There are two smaller waterfalls, Rio de Molina and Refugio del salto, before getting into Avandaro; the first is visible from the road with several roadside restaurants, so you may be able to include those on the way back to Valle. Taking a collective taxi from Valle (central plaza) to Avandaro will cost you 15 MXN$ and from Avandaro to Velo de Novia 10 MXN$.\\n\\nFor more info on Valle de Bravo visit:\\n\\nhttp://cocinax.com/travel/valle-de-bravo-edmex/", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cascadas Velo de Novia", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/e8/d9/f5/cascadas-velo-de-novia.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Circuito Avandaro 120", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "51200", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "262098857": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Amazing Nature Walk and Waterfalls", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499427-d3336877-Reviews-Cascadas_Velo_de_Novia-Valle_de_Bravo_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/e8/d9/f5/cascadas-velo-de-novia.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Awesome spot if you are visiting Avandaro or Valle de Bravo and love nature.

Unfortunately the more famous sanctuaries, like Rosario, are simply too far to do as a day trip from CDMX, which was all the time we could spare. Luckily I did some digging and found this place, which was fantastic and just as magical as the more famous places, but only two hours from the city, and thus possible on a day trip. \\nI would recommend getting a guide just b/c driving in the city can be intimidating for the uninitiated, and I found it easier to go with someone who could take us there and back and take care of the tolls, parking and entrance fees. We used El Planeto Mexico and were extremely happy with them. (I wrote a separate review for that company on TripAdvisor, if you\\'re interested.)\\nAs for the sanctuary itself, I\\'ll admit that I was sort of heartbroken when we rolled up on a Saturday at noon to see the parking lot swarming with more people than our guide said he\\'d ever seen before. But here\\'s the thing--you can\\'t really go early to beat the crowds b/c the noon-time sun is what gets the most butterflies moving. That said, if it looks like its\\' going to be a good sunny day, you could try getting there around 2, when the sun is still strong but (it seems) more tourists have already done the trip. But be aware that if it\\'s cloudy, or not around noon, there won\\'t be many butterflies flying; instead they\\'ll just clinging to the branches (and I think everyone has to leave by 4). In the end tho, it was totally fine. When we got to the main monarch area my camera was just pointed up and at flowers, so it didn\\'t matter about the crowds; there were plenty of butterflies for all. I\\'m the kind of person who hates to be on a crowded trail, but it didn\\'t detract from the magic in this case.  \\nYou can rent horses to take you up, but you\\'ll still have to walk the final way. I read previous reviews that said the horses don\\'t do the hardest part of the trail for you, and while that may have been the case in past years, really it depends on where the butterflies roost, and when we went, people who took horses got to ride almost all the way up to the site. But next year could be different again. As an animal lover, I was happy to see that the horses appeared to be fairly well fed and cared for, had shade to rest in, and didn\\'t seem to be struggling up the hill (although I think there should be a weight limit for tourists riding them). \\nStill, I chose not to spend the 300 pesos to ride them and I\\'m very happy with my decision to hike myself. I\\'m in decent shape (going to the gym 2-3 times a week and enjoy light hiking) but live at sea level and can be pretty lazy, so I was torn about what to do. However, the hike wasn\\'t hard at all. After being in CDMX for 3 days the altitude wasn\\'t a problem, and the crowds were actually a blessing: They ensured that we walked slowly enough that we didn\\'t get out of breath or struggle. In the end it was about a 45 minute hike, but I didn\\'t find it hard at all; I never even got out of breath or broke a sweat. I think anyone in reasonable shape who has some time to adjust to altitude and takes their time will have zero problem hiking themselves. There were plenty of young children and grandparents doing the hike too, just FYI, so don\\'t be intimidated by people saying it was super hard. I do agree with the recommendation tho to bring a mask or bandana and wear clothes you don\\'t mind getting dusty b/c the dust was no joke. \\nIn the end, I think this the best option for a day trip from Mexico City, the vast majority of visitors can probably do the hike themselves, and it\\'s worth the trip.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Piedra Herrada Sanctuary", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/66/79/3b/mariposas-monarca-en.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "649900576": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Fast, Furious, Fabulous", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499427-d506245-Reviews-Piedra_Herrada_Sanctuary-Valle_de_Bravo_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/66/79/3b/mariposas-monarca-en.jpg", "datePublished": "February 3, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "My daughter and I made a whirlwind 40 hr trip.

The tour itself was good, the 2km hike to sanctuary took us over one hour, it\\u2019s a bit strenuous but doable. As you approach the top you start seeing one or two butterflies and you get excited. Our guide Brisa told us to hold the excitement for when we reach top.

I was so excited to come to this place, but when I saw I was utterly shattered. May be my expectation from this place was more than what I really saw there. \\n\\nBelow is my observations:\\n1. The place is a good 40 min from the main town. So plan to take your cab and also fix a return. You do not get a cab there. Forget about Uber. Uber doesnt have any service in the whole town. \\n2. You can bargain for any taxi for 300 - 400 Pesos for the round trip. \\n3. The taxi will take you to the parking lot. You need to buy the entry ticket. 60 Pesos for adults and 40 for kids. \\n4. From the entrance, there is a climb. If you wish you can walk all the way up. Or you can take horses from the parking. These horses will cost you 200 pesos each for a round trip. they will take you to a certain point and then there is a 1500 meters climb after that. The climb is very steep. I have done it with my 3 year old son and he enjoyed it. My seven year old son didnt need any assistance. The road is very muddy and slippery. be  careful. Take a stick from the place where you get dropped from the horse - it will really help you to climb up. Leave it back at the same place for other fellow travellers for future :-)\\n5. You need to plan is well. Avoid Cloudy weather. In cloudy weather, the butterflies will not leave the tree trunk and all you will see is a black mass. \\n6. There are few shops at the parking to eat. \\n7. If you go by your own car, the parking fees is 20 pesos. \\n8. The whole trip takes almost 2 hours (in a relaxed way) - calculating from parking spot back to parking spot. \\n9. The trek is awesome. You will enjoy it. \\n10. wear comfortable shoes.. there is a lot of dust on the way, dont try to dust it off.. you will get more. Clean when you reach back to the parking lot. \\n11. Small gift shops are also there to buy some local made gifts. \\n12.

Once inside the sanctuary, you can find everything necessary to have a good time such as local restaurants, bathrooms and games for kids; for the trip to see the monarchs I do really recommend to take the horse option, unless you have very good physical condition because the way up is very challenging, when you reach the butterflies respect all the little animals and please don\\'t take anyone with you.

When we arrived at the sanctuary there were many vendors selling handicrafts. I bought two lovely handwoven baskets made out of the leaves from the forest after I finished the tour. It is a very steep climb to the top so, there are many kids with horses for hire. My guide and I opted to ride a horse.  We passed many people that were on the side of the path exhausted from trying to hike to the top.  I was glad that I opted for the horse. It will save you a lot of pain and misery.   When you first set out on the trail you see a few butterflies fluttering along the path but as you get closer to the top thousands more start to appear.  When we finally got to the top we saw millions of Monarchs flying around and clinging to the trunks of trees.

I will give you here a few advice which, from my point of view, will help you with the experiance.\\nFirst of all the sanctuary is about 2 hrs drive from Mexico City so there is no problem whatsever to visit it during just one day. I know there are also a one day organised tours from the city which make it even easier.\\nFirstly there is only one official entrance with a big parking lot in front - don\\'t stop anywhere else if you want to pay the official fees. Parking fee is \\u00a310.\\nWhile paying in the small ticket office $50 for the entrance ticket you will be offered to hire a horse for $200 [this is a ride up and return]. The guide fee - hiking or horse ride - are included in the ticket price so it\\'s entirely up to you if you want to tip him at the end.\\nAnd here was a dilema after reading some of the reviews on this forum. Is it worth or not to take a horse? I decide to hike/trek and was very happy with my decission, it tooks me 40 minutes to get to the point where horses are allowed, hike is easy [yes! not hard at all!] and very enjoyable, if you live in Mexico City the altitude also shouldn\\'t be a problem. Go for it! Your boots will get a bit dusty but that is part of the adventure! To get to the meeting point by horses is aproximately 30-35 minutes.\\nFrom that point all visitors have to walk with the assistance of the guide, again it is not difficult but I would say it is a bit more hard and steep than the first part I have hiked. Remember that this time you will take your time watching the Monarch Butterflies and listening the guide who will give you [in Spanish] some interesting facts about these incredible creatures  and surrounding enviroment...\\nOne more thing which is important is the time of the visit. Remember not to be too early as butterflies start flying arround when is already warm and sun is up. In our case that was around 12 - 12:30pm. If you go there too early you will see only \\'cocoons\\' of resting Monarcas.\\nJust in front of the entrance you can use toilets, buy some souvenirs and snacks or vitamina T products eg. tacos :)\\nEnjoy!!\\n\\n*all prices are from Feb 2016 and in mexican Pesos.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Piedra Herrada Sanctuary", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/66/79/3b/mariposas-monarca-en.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "349255722": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Relatively Accessible, Not So Crowded", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499427-d506245-Reviews-Piedra_Herrada_Sanctuary-Valle_de_Bravo_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/66/79/3b/mariposas-monarca-en.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "There is more than one butterfly sanctuary in Mexico, and probably the most pristine and least visited is near the town of Macheros; it\\'s called Cerro Pellon.

Take the main entrance (3rd) where you see official signs and washrooms. They are well organized, but your tickets, then approach the entrance and rent a horse if you want one. The walk up can take anywhere from 1hr-2.5 hours, depending on your pace. I hiked about 1/3 of the way and I\\'m in decent shape but the steep climb and altitude made me wish I had joined the rest of our group on horses. I managed to find a man with a horse and he agreed to take me up. These horses normally climb up 1-2 times daily (no more) and although some look weaker than others, they are in good shape and the guide told me that they are all fed together (some kids had wanted to feed them apples and carrots) and well taken care of. On a horse, it takes about 50 min to get to the top. From there it\\'s a 15-20 min walk up to where you can see them all flying around (once the sun comes out). For a family of 4 we paid 150-200 per horse and 200 for the entrance fee. You can tip your guide at the end. If you arrive by 10am and take a horse, you can be back down by 1/2pm (depending how long you spend at the top). I was impressed there was no litter along the way and how well the sanctuary has been preserved. If you decide to hike it, wear appropriate shoes and take your time (about 2 hours at a leisurely pace). We didn\\'t need any sunscreen, insect repellent or hats. A good walking stick is handy as it can be steep at parts. We saw small kids and even an amputee with crutches walking it.

I had read several of the reviews on here, but on the morning we went, I checked one last time for any hints and for hours and hit upon gold. I didn\\'t find the hours, but there was a new review that mentioned using the 3rd entrance. This little piece of info may have saved us big time. We have been in Mexico long enough to know that someone is always trying to get your money before the official entrance, but I may never have thought to keep going past the first one we saw. Not surprisingly, locals have hung a banner right in front of an official Pierre Herradas sign with their own which makes it look like an entrance. The 2nd one had orange cones and police, so it looked more legit, and may have been, but the 3rd entrance has a huge parking lot, official signs (not vinyl banners) and tickets with pricing on them which was 50 pesos. Our horses were $150 pesos round trip. Definitely well worth it for each of us. Only the youngest, at 3, didn\\'t ride his own horse. The saddles are wooden, so you will be sore at the end, but it took us about 40 min by horse up a nice trail that got steeper and steeper as we went. Our guide was nice and we understood enough Spanish to get some interesting info. We saw zero butterflies until we were 10 minutes into our walk up to the trees after dismounting from the horses. We were quite surprised, but they congregate in a tight area that you aren\\'t allowed to enter. Once they start warming in the sun and fly around a bit (starting at about noon) it is just breathtaking and they often fly around you or land on you. We were allowed about 30 min with the Monarchs before needing to head back down. Since we were there on a Monday morning, there were only about 10 other visitors up there. I highly recommend a camera with a long zoom!  \\nAt the base there were bathrooms for 5 pesos, but they didn\\'t have running water, although the facility was nice enough. There is also a basic restaurant and a souvenir hut with things like t-shirts, keychains, and toys that are all branded with a monarch and the sanctuary name. \\nThe only questionable fee we ran into was as we were getting in our cars to leave, a lady ran up and said we never paid for parking. We saw no parking fee signs, although they had pricing signs for everything else, so we went back and forth a bit, saying as much and ended up giving her 20 of the 40 pesos she asked for per car. \\nSince I\\'ve never been to another sanctuary, I can\\'t compare facilities or butterflies viewing, but overall, I\\'d say we got the experience we came for and enjoyed the cheap trail ride that came with the once in a lifetime experience of seeing the monarchs we hatch in our home state of WI migrate to. \\nBy the way, the hours posted were Monday to Sunday 9am-4pm.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Piedra Herrada Sanctuary", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/66/79/3b/mariposas-monarca-en.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "339728427": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Very well protected and a must-see", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499427-d506245-Reviews-Piedra_Herrada_Sanctuary-Valle_de_Bravo_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/66/79/3b/mariposas-monarca-en.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "On arrival and on payment to enter (MXN$50), you have the option of walking up to the butterflies (about 2 hours uphill and at 3000m so be prepared) or going on horseback (MXN$150).

Also go slow as the hike is long and the altitude really takes your breath away. I enjoyed this sanctuary as it was in a more natural setting.

T-shirts and other hand crafted souvenirs. The walk is much easier then Piedra Herrada in Valle de Bravo in Mexico state( which is very expensive as caters to the very rich Mexicans from the city) and just as rewarding. The 3rd sanctuary we visited was also in Michoacan State just a few miles above Angangueo offers the least strenuous hike of any of the sanctuaries. Sierra Chincua is located just a few miles northeast of the town of Angangueo. This site is laid out like a national park in the states or in Canada and is the butterflies were in the most beautiful and open setting of the 3 we visited.

Finally they left us alone and we continued up. We paid the $100 MX sanctuary entrance fee. Experiencing the butterflies in their natural habitat was well worth the hour trek up to 3000m, and the hour stay we had with them. There were millions, so many that you can hear loudly the flapping of their wings. The way down was obviously much faster, a quick 30 minutes. Going by foot, we were only required to pay $200 MX to the guide and this was made clear to us from the beginning, when we were also offered to go by horse for $200 MX each.

Not too many were flying around, as it was very late afternoon, and Monarchs don\\'t fly when the weather dips to 55 degrees.  But we were still able to see a few and many clustered up in the trees.  We chose to take horses, as we wanted to be able to get up there and back before they closed around 5pm.  Entrance costs 50 pesos, and you can walk up the mountain, if you want, but wear good walking shoes, particularly since it is very dusty, with loose soil on the trail.  The horseback trip costs 150 pesos for each horse, and we left a 50 peso tip for each guide, as it was an arduous and dusty walk for them to lead us, and they have to work hard to make a living.  Local farmers from the village nearby own the horses and don\\'t have a very long season at the preserve, so need to find other ways to make a living as well.  The lucky ones own more than one horse, so they can rotate them.  The trip up is steep, so hopefully most of the horses are rotated.  The guides speak very little English but are so helpful and kind that English really isn\\'t necessary for those who don\\'t speak Spanish.  (Some speak Nahuatl as their native language, as well.) The optimum time to see the butterflies is in January, if you get the chance.  According to the locals, when the Monarchs are flying through in big &quot;clouds,&quot; traffic is stopped on the highway to let them go by safely.  NOTE:  If you are taking the bus up from Mexico City, take the Los Saucos bus and ask the driver to let you off at Piedra Herrada.  Leaving the preserve, walk out to the road around 10 min. before the hour to flag down a bus to Valle de Bravo.

Fortunately, there was great weather and there were still butterflies that were around. They were saying that there weren\\'t many butterflies around, but for me it was still a sight. You can\\'t get too close to any butterflies cos they tend to flutter up above the trees, and ironically those you can get close to on the ground are either dead or dying. I\\'ve read many sites about making the trip around 9am, but we started at 12noon and arrived at the butterflies site at 1pm and it was perfect because it got much warmer and there was more activity then. Just stand there in silence and watch them flutter across the sky, that\\'s the best memory you can take away...\\n\\nThe hike up is difficult and not well signed, so I\\'d suggest you take the horse ride which costs MXN 120. Do tip the horse guide since he walking just as fast as the horse on both the hike up and down the rather rough terrain! \\n\\nInstructions on how to get there for independent travelers/ drivers are scare, but here\\'s the route we took and it worked out for us. The sanctuary is located south of Valle de Bravo. If you are driving from Toluca/ Mexico City, the best to do is to get on the Carretera 134/ Toluca Ciudad Altamirano highway. This highway is toll free, and for first timers it\\'s a scenic (though windy) ride through the Parque Nacional de Toluca. Right after you pass the town San Francisco Oxtotilpan (you won\\'t miss it because you\\'ll see a PEMEX gas station on your right, one of the first in many miles within the national park), there is a tiny slip road that leads you to Valle de Bravo. The sign is also blocked by trees, so do slow down. From here, it\\'s a 7-8 km drive towards Valle de Bravo before you hit the sanctuary, which will be on your right. You\\'ll first pass the huge parking lot for the sanctuary before the entrance. But make sure you signal because cars on this stretch tend to drive quite fast and most of them quite impatient!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Piedra Herrada Sanctuary", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/66/79/3b/mariposas-monarca-en.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "126241417": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "End of season but so worth it", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499427-d506245-Reviews-Piedra_Herrada_Sanctuary-Valle_de_Bravo_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/66/79/3b/mariposas-monarca-en.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This bio-reserve is home to millions of Monarch butterflies every winter after their annual migration from Canada and Northern USA.

Every year, starting by November, millions (literally) of monarch butterflies arrive to the forest of Central Mexico. They leave us by March. Two mexican states share the visit of the fragile insects: Estado de Mexico and Michoacan. All along the border between these two states, several sanctuaries have been opened to the public, being Piedra Herrada just one of them, although all are very good. Remember it\\u00b4s all about nature so nobody can predict the exact location and the amounts of butterflies in every sanctuary. So be prepared for a long walk in the woods and, if you come from low altitude place, take one or two days to get used to altitudes above 3000 meters above the sea level. If you\\u00b4\\u00b4re not in good physical condition, there are horses for rent available, so don\\u00b4t worry. These sanctuaries are managed by the local communities. You have to be accompanied by a local guide all the time. Don\\u00b4t expect them to speak in English. If you are traveling with another guide, s/he will certainly explain to you what the local guide says.\\nWhen you get to the place where the butterflies are, possibly after one hour walk or ride, you\\u00b4ll start watching the trees and their branches fully covered by agglomerated butterflies. If it\\u00b4s a sunny day, it\\u00b4s very likely to see them flying all around you. Something hard to describe, even with pictures or video. In some areas, you\\u00b4ll see a carpet made of lots of dead butterflies in the ground, that have fallen from the trees or because of low temperatures. Many of them could still be alive, so be careful. Sometimes, you can see the paths in the woods full of butterflies flying towards water sources for drinking or coming back. They even cross the highways and when that happens, there is people located at both ends of the way, asking you to reduce your vehicle speed.\\nThis is one of the great events in nature to witness, that I don\\u00b4t consider a &quot;once in a lifetime experience&quot;.
