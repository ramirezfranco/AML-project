I was captain of a 60 Striker and later a 72 Palmer Johnson sport fisherman.  It is 66 miles to Isla Perez on the south end and about 74 miles to Desterrada on the northern end.  There are 5 islands out there.  You can only camp on Isla Perez overnight.  The fishing is great but one needs to know how to fish.  There are plenty of birds that live out there.  One needs to be careful so that you don\\u2019t lose your boat on a reef, very careful.  You need to buy your permit to enter the park before you go.  There is a daily fee per person.  The water visibility is very good usually 50 to 150 feet.  The reefs are incredible.  There is an arching reef on the east side of about 15 miles long that you can run a dingy aground on.  I used to troll for black groupers along the reef and the barracudas were thick along there as well.  We did catch occasional tunas, wahoo, king mackerel, African pompanos there trolling.  You can anchor and catch yellowtail snapper, triggerfish and groupers.  If you fish to the northwest, the water gets deep and you can catch blue marlin, white marlin, sailfish, dorados, wahoo and tunas.  Some days are better than others out there.  The wahoo and tunas are the thickest in September and October.  Most people go to enjoy the beaches and swimming and snorkeling and drinking and partying.  I like to fish.  It is the largest reef in the Gulf of Mexico.  It is unique and definitely worth seeing.  Most of my trips were 3 days and 2 nights.  I had an experienced fly fisherman and he caught somewhere between 50 and 100 fish on his fly rod in April on Isla Pereez walking and casting his flys.  It is an adventure and a major expedition.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Scorpion Reef", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/17/3e/40/b1/scorpion-reef.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "140 km al Norte de Progreso", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Malecon-Progreso_Yucatan_Peninsula": {"668123582": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A very beautiful walk along the oceanfront.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g668864-d15510316-Reviews-Malecon-Progreso_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/15/a0/1e/cf/gran-vista.jpg", "datePublished": "April 21, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Many good restaurants and shops along the way.

You have to go there by boat because it is about 50 yards south of the bypass that runs behind Progreso toward the beaches east of Progreso.  The government bought it or took control of it a few years ago.  They invested in it and made lots of improvements.  I have known one of the founders for many years, who still works there.  There are several cenotes or fresh water springs there to see and swim in if you like.  They dug them out and protected a few so that the brackish water of the ceniga/swamp doesn\\u2019t get in to the swimming area. Nice and clear fresh water is in the largest natural pool of water.  It is shady and has trails through the mangroves.  There are some rustic wooden buildings to protect one from the rain or sunlight or hang a hammock.  There are some raccoons and coti mundis that live there and they will sometimes approach looking for a handout of something to eat.  It is an interesting natural place full of life and how things were before people and the modern world changed things, in old Yucatan.  You can pack up a lunch and snacks to take across when you go.  It is open daylight only.  It is definitely worth seeing and really isn\\u2019t that expensive.  Sometimes you can see flamingos there wading and feeding or flying overhead.  I have seen flights of flamingos that had over 1000 birds flying in a winding trail in the air that continued for about an hour.  Usually they are in smaller groups up the beach around observation tower in Huaymitun or toward the highway that comes in to Progreso from Merida.

It was also our first one ever.  So we weren\\'t as much of a fan of theses cenotes because they are green and not clear at all.  The nice thing is that some of the cenotes are very shallow, as in a couple of feet deep, so that is nice for younger kids.  While here, you will also see many raccoons that will come up to meet you, hoping for food.  The Reserve no longer allows visitors to bring in food to feed the animals and they will check your bags as you board the small boat that takes you to the cenotes.  Definitely not a bad stop and especially good because of its proximity to Progreso, so it makes an excellent excursion from a cruise ship.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Reserva Ecologica El Corchito", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0f/10/e5/1d/photo0jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Yucatan 27 36 km de Merida", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "559254636": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "We came to the eco-park as a stop on Sergio\\'s Tours", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g668864-d7218335-Reviews-Reserva_Ecologica_El_Corchito-Progreso_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0f/10/e5/1d/photo0jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "You boat across a small lake and into a channel cut into the mangroves.

I got off the bus from Merida at the Bodega Aurerra and walked about 25 minutes along the highway to this place.  The sidewalks are in excellent shape, but it is deserted and very industrial.  I would not recommend walking alone but if you are in a group, go for it!  Do not walk here in the dark as there is no lighting and it is very deserted.\\n\\n*** When I was done, I walked two/three blocks north from the glorieta (round-about) in front of El Corchito.  I walked to get a pesero (small bus) back to the centro to visit the malecon (boardwalk).  It is totally sketchy, and I walked by a deserted field, a group of men throwing industrial trash into the bush illegally, and a dead dog.  This is not for the faint-of-heart tourist but if you are with friends or know Mexico, go for it.  At the Agua Purificada place (on the right), you go a little farther ahead (10-20 meters) and turn left and the pesero is there (parked) or will arrive there.
