As a regular visitor, I am always looking for new campsites that are safe, secure, and  sometimes surprising. \\n\\nInterestingly, I enjoy a significant degree of safety not possible across the border in El PasoTX-USA. There are several reasons which may account for this: my extraordinary bicycle (a very visible Doublevision); adherence to the rules of the road, which means staying to the right where all slow traffic (not only bicycles, but horse drawn carts, pushcarts, etc.) have a recognized position on the multi-modal roads; being a loud voice for this dynamic &quot;Hidden Gem of the World, Crossroads of North America, anchored by El Paso, Cd. Juarez &amp; Las Cruces!&quot; (most easily accessed by the &quot;International Ft. Hancock-Las Cruces I-10 BIcycle Bypass&quot;); having a certain amount of celebrity--or notoriety in the general population; falling and having aid being rendered immediately by concerned Mexicanos; or others. \\n     \\nAnyway, I decided to camp at a designated area in Parque Chamizal, bounded on all four sides by roads (South is major route Avenida Colegio Militar; East is the off-ramp of major route Avenida Abraham Lincoln/Avenida de las Americas; North is park road Carlos Pelicer; West is a gated gravel park road) on Saturday, 15OCT2016. My specific reason for selecting this site was the convenience of proximity to the border [3 miles/5kms to the free international puente libre/Cordova Bridge/Bridge of the Americas(BOTA)] after having spent much of the day pedaling through Eastern Cd. JuarezCHIH-EUM(Esatados Unidos de Mexico), crossing over a distance downstream at the toll Ysleta Port of Entry (POE) on Zaragoza Road. While I\\'m continually exploring areas of Cd. Juarez, my specific interest this weekend was verifying &amp; validating another segment of the aforementioned &quot;International Ft. Hancock-Las Cruces I-10 Bicycle Bypass&quot;.  \\n\\nIt was late afternoon by the time of my arrival at this camping area, and exhaustion made me extremely grateful I didn\\'t have to pedal farther. I was also glad to be carrying &quot;Deep Woods Off&quot; as many Malaria, Zeka- &amp; West Nile virus mozzies expressed interest in my sweat-laden skin. While resting away from other persons and the busy roads, the camping area eventually emptied of the dayusers and I was able to snag an excellent pavillion for my self and my Doublevision. Not that rain was anticipated nor forecast--I hadn\\'t packed my tarp-tent--one never knows when a storm might stir. While eating another portion of the delicious chicke I had purchased earlier at the fine Pollo feliz eatery on the corner of Calle Arizona &amp; Juan Pablo II, I heard loud music booming in the distance to the West, and was grateful again for not being so close to sounds that could keep me awake. \\n\\nI needen;t have been concerned; the sounds of busy road traffic lulled me to sleep, and I was quite pleased when the booming music abruptly stopped. Surely I\\'m meant to get a decent night\\'s sleep! Later, the flashing red lights of vehicles moving slowly along the Eastbound lanes of Avenida Heroico Colegio Militar roused me for a moment before dropping back into slumber. \\n\\nI woke fairly refreshed early under a bright full Moon and graying sky. While finishing off the rest of that delicious Pollo Feliz, I noticed that motor vehicle were beginning to swarm into a parking area between the campsites and the South &amp; East major roads, with the operators/passengers--most dressed in running garb--walking west on the sidewalk between Parque Chamizal and the road. Then I heard the booming music; I knew I had to investigate.\\n\\nWith gear re-stowed on my Doublevision, I, too, pedaled West, taking the right-hand lane of Avenida Heroica Colegio Militarl, moving ever-closer to the deafening sounds. Before I knew it, I turned right/North with the masses into the Benito Juarez Olympic Stadium, then funneled between two stands of cheering masses. \\n\\nHey, this was great! I saw a few other bicyclists, but they were adorned with official-looking vests--and everybody else was running. I had inadvertently joined the international Cd. Juarez Marathon. I was welcomed, someone shouting out (in English) that it was &quot;good to see you!&quot;  A massive international gathering of tens of thousands of runners from around the World compete, not so much against each other but against a clock, the clock of surviving the 42km/26.2mile of constantn joint jarring pounding of the bones. I was especially impressed with the Tarahumara runners, mostly women in a difficult traditional garb. It was expertly sponsored by Natural Gas of Juarez and largely staffed by volunteers, including girl &amp; boy scouts, local police, and a multitude of supporters. I was ecstatic to participate, especially as the route wound through downtown, into the tunnel underpass beneath the Guadalupe Mission.\\n\\nQuite soon, my continued admittance into this primarily a foot race had purpose: a wheelchair racer (Gilberto) had a blowout on one of his wheels. When biketouring, I always carry a rather heavy tool bag, within which was a tube of slime. About a third of the way through the marathon, I pedaled to Gilberto with his stricken wheelchair, but even slime couldn\\'t help  the worn out tubes. Seizing my roll of ductape, Gilberto quickly wrapped the now deflated tube/wheel and pledged to continue on, which is what I did, pedaling toward the midway point. My new joy of this race was to pick up water and powerade at numerous aid stations, then deliver those to runners struggling to keep moving. \\n\\nWhen I pedaled back through the finish line, I noted that my time was 4 hours, 39 minutes--a full 19 minutes longer than my first marathon, the Rose Bowl in the late \\'70s, during my Navy days. It took me 4 hours, 10 minutes to actually run the dastardly long distance. But, I had spent a goodly amount of time stopped, helping others, which made everything A-OK!  \\n\\nSo there you have it; a superior campsite elevated with much  interaction with ;the fantastic Juarenses. It was such an honor, and my confidence about cycling South of the border is amplified knowing about this free camping area.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Parque El Chamizal", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/a5/e8/84/cool-view-great-piramid.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av.

Anyway, this zone of shifting borders (as is true for any such river) was under immense pressure for control and conflict between the two major powers (USA &amp; USM) for over a century, unresolved until former Presidents Mateos &amp; Johnson finalized corrective actions to keep the wily river within artificial banks that made for a stable border. The USA side has Chamizal National Memorial; this, the USM side has made a wonderfully large, well-maintained space available to everyone for virtually any kind of an outing occasion. I thoroughly enjoy pedaling through this quiet area (unless a fiesta is ongoing!), before having to deal with the noisy cities of Juarez or El Paso! It is easily accessible; if coming from the USA over the (free) Bridge of the Americas, turn right/West at the first available chance; if coming from Juarez, motor (or bike, as I do) or walk along Avenida Heroica Colegio Militar/MX45/Avenida de las Americas.

Even though El PasoTX-USA has been my home for over twenty years, and easily the best landmarks are the Franklin Mountains, North of the Rio Bravo/Rio Grande &amp; Sierra Juarez, South of the Rio Bravo/Rio Grande, other human-built features also allow orientation. The most recent include the reviled &amp; respected Border Fence, and the Monumento a la Mexicaneidad, characterized by the Red X.  I am especially fond of it when pedaling as it marks an free entrance/exit between the countries of USA &amp; USM. When I cam close to the X, I am close to the USA. However, please note that while it is quite large, it can be lost, even if the building between my street-level view and the X is small. Perspective rules, but since I have a pretty good sense of direction--virtually all of the streets are North-South, East-West--dead-reckoning gets me close enough to find my way. I haven\\'t figured it out yet, but the glass-bubble-balcony enclosing the midsection of the X is for El Grito, the annual call remembering Mexican independence, 17SEP1810 by Father Hidalgo.  Anyway, pedaling by this fine sculpture is always great; it is surrounded by extensive parklands, all of which was part of the Chamizal/Cordova Island/no man\\'s land, a sizable area of a century-long shifting border issue that was finally resolved by former Presidents Kennedy &amp; Johnson with the unholy (in my opinion) dredging/ditching/channelizing of a meandering Rio Bravo/Rio Grande.

In fact, the last time she had crossed over was 2007, when we, (la familia Eyberg) were dropped off by Zar &amp; we walked to catch a bus to the Abraham Gonzalez International Airport (CJS)-Juarez airport [the reason was convenience &amp; cost; prior to 9/11, I+brother Nils+cousin Elizabeth had boarded a flight from truly international El Paso airport (ELP) to Los Mochis, connecting through Chihuahua &amp; back; additionally, I was escorting my then 70-ish mother to/from Panama/Mexico City, with departure/return from ELP; but after the horrific WTC bombing, ELP became strictly national/regional; instead of a quick 3-hour  flight to Mexico City, it was a lengthy--and ridiculously unnecessary--flight from other distant USA airports!] for our Mexico City Spring break trip. \\nAnyway, I began returning to the wonderful country of Mexico, specifically Cd. Juarez/Valle de Juarez/San Agustin/Casa de Adobe when I somewhat inadvertently pedaled my Doublevision across the Fabens/Tornillo-Cazeta Port-of-Entry (POE); all I really wanted to do was investigate construction of the new bridge....! It was then (2012) that I learned violence had decreased to even less than that in the sister city of El Paso (continually ranked as &quot;safest&quot;!), that bicycling and camping there was incredibly safe and I was welcomed. Consequently, I have frequently returned, pedaling the extent of Ruta Dos/other roads from the Eastern-most terminus in el Porvenir to San Jeronimo/Santa TeresaNM POE on the Northernmost border. While the full biketour journey takes me 2-3 days, I usually pedal a day trip to Casa de Adobe (where former President Francisco I. Madero &amp; Pancho Villa met in 1911 to determine the future of Mexico after the then-ongoing revolution; adjacent to Boundary Marker one/Rio Bravo/Rio Grande, which is probably the single most scrutinized US Border Patrol location anywhere!), professionally curated by Alfredo during the usual museum hours Tuesday-Sunday.\\nSo, with our #1 son and his fiancee visiting from their home in CambridgeMA-USA, the four of us parked our (motor) vehicle downtown El Paso in the US Parking Lot (South Santa Fe Street;0-8 hours=$3) adjacent to the Santa Fe Bridge/Puente Santa Fe, marked by an interesting outdoor sculpture and remarkable automated free loo--last I\\'d ever seen like it was in AKL and HelsinkiFI--and walked across after buying a $2.00 ticket ($0.50pp). This bridge has nicely covered sidewalks that can be used by pedestrians North and South, but is Northbound only for (motor) vehicles or a Doublevision. All traffic, both pedestrian and vehicular, was extremely light on this Christmas Eve 2014. \\nAs indicated earlier, all of my traveling into Mexico has been primarily on my \\u0010Doublevision; I\\'ve not crossed the bridge as a pedestrian since 2007.  I was shocked at how much change this major POE has changed/is changing during the intervening 7 years. \\nNo longer is the road South (Juarez) a dusty, potholed, creviced &amp; cracked, challenging walk; current sidewalk/road renovation is steadily making this route so very, very user friendly. Our stroll South was to see the heart of Juarez, which is the original Mision de Se\\u00f1ora de Guadalupe/Catedral de Ciudad Juarez. It is magnificent, as the adjacent Museo de la Antigua Presidencial Municipal (where the fantastic Bomberos were handing out toys to the wee ones who had been lining up for several blocks/as long as 24 hours prior) and Mercado Cuauhtemoc (it was originally 4 levels until a fire burned the interior, but now rebuilt to 3).  After visiting these exciting sites, we walked a circuitous route East to this amazing museum. \\nEntrance was at the rear, and, being Christmas Eve, it was fee-free, though I left a significant donation when departing. Inside, is a World-class exhibit that encompasses relevant recent history, especially about Pancho Villa. There are several rooms which encourage &amp; entice every individual, whether 3 or 300 years old, to explore and learn. I was particularly fascinated by the 3D map of the region, and will tie it into my own presentation of effective cycling throughout this area, which I consider to be the &quot;Hidden Gem of the World&quot;! \\nIt is so wonderful, practical, and convenient to go across the border now, but always remember to bring your passport/passcard for re-entry into the USA. Another colleague has told me that he never takes his passport when pedaling over, and has never had any trouble returning, but I\\'ll never find out.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Museo de la Revolucion en La Frontera", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/92/4b/1d/acceso-sur.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av 16 de Septiembre y Av Juarez Zona Centro", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Juarez", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "32000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "169073329": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Interesting and Free", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150780-d4340841-Reviews-Museo_de_la_Revolucion_en_La_Frontera-Ciudad_Juarez_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/92/4b/1d/acceso-sur.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This museum is really interesting; with a lot of information about the mexican revolution.There is a small archaeology area and a photography area were they have some interesting facts about people that was part of the revolution that were not mexicans.(The museum is located near the border with Texas not far from the international bridge.)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Museo de la Revolucion en La Frontera", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/92/4b/1d/acceso-sur.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av 16 de Septiembre y Av Juarez Zona Centro", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Juarez", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "32000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "163712321": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Interesting information about the Mexican Revolution", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150780-d4340841-Reviews-Museo_de_la_Revolucion_en_La_Frontera-Ciudad_Juarez_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/92/4b/1d/acceso-sur.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The name of this museum is, The Museum of the Revolution in the Border, so it\\'s no surprise that the theme of the museum revolves around the Mexican Revolution in this area of the country.

After a great overnight in Parque Reforma, I woke up the rooters and continued pedaling my Doublevision North on Ruta Dos, enjoying much-needed hot java at the Museo in San Agustin and had a good lookabout, guided by no less than curator Professor Manuel Robles! This was GREAT! However, what really made my day was arriving at Casa de Adobe, which shares one of the most historically significant (and neglected site on the USA side) boundaries on Earth. The Mexcians have made this area an extremely wonderful place to visit, just by virtue of it\\'s historical significance. You won\\'t find any fast-food nearby (unless a food-truck happens to be present, along with large numbers of other people who might be swimming, sunning, or just relaxing. Or one chico getting his bloodied foot bandaged by me--but that didn\\'t stop him from jumping in the Rio Bravo immediately thereafter!) or bathrooms, but you will find a few trees, sheltering the foundation of the original building, Boundary Marker #1, US Border Patrol carefully watching the area, signs advising all persons about the border (in Spanish; you have to cross the border to see it in English), a carreta, bust of Sr. Madero, the Mexican flag (of course) proudly atop the pole, and a snug 2-room adobe building. One aspect is that this is a place that marks the junction of two countries (USA &amp; USM) and three states (Chihuahua, Texas, New Mexico), currently the site of 2 brick factories as well as this Casa de Adobe. I was extremely fortunate in that my progress had been good; my arrival at this Northernmost point on the border was mid-afternoon Tuesday 26NOV2013, was excellent as docent Alfredo gave me a personalized tour. This relatively new reproduction of the original structure was symbolic of the intense collaboration 16APR-21MAY1911 between well-educated politician Francisco Madero (USM President 1911-1913; assassinated)  and poorly educated but charismatic &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa in the Plan de San Luis. Here is where the near future of Mexico was determined, between individuals competing for power. It historical fact that once any individual became numero uno, others seek to unseat that individual--past, present, and likely well into the future, around the World. My goal, obviously much less radical, is to upgrade this entire area from an challenging access, derelict (USA side) site into a non-motorized (specifically for bicycles, especially Doublevisions!) international port of entry. Such a creation would be beneficial economically for all entrepreneurs of both countries, but it would attract all persons (and there are millions) who could more easily visit this immensely important site.

Of course, the much older mission, established 1659, has been the root for other missions throughout the region. It serves as the anchor for many millions of people, both those who are passing through and reside, with some of the first believers accompanying conquistador Don Juan de Onate. He and his massive entourage from Mexico City had gone North, crossing the arid Chihuahuan Desert, arriving on the banks of the wet Rio Bravo/Rio Grande in San ElizarioTX (Southeastern suburb of present-day El PasoTX)--were they ever so glad to finally drink cold fresh water! In fact, that was the &quot;First Thanksgiving&quot; in 1598, and is celebrated every April in that historic community. Anyway, access to this Mision de Nuestra Se\\u00f1ora de Guadalupe is by foot, an easy walk South from El PasoTX-USA (with valid passport in hand), across Puente Santa Fe on well-developed Avenida Juarez to busy Avenida 15 de Septiembre. Turn right\\\\West to see the imposing latter day church which dwarfs the adjacent mission, but don\\'t fooled--the older building is the true foundation. Note the vigas above, delicate frescos/murals/statues and be respectfully quiet. Leave a donation. Wonder to yourself how amazing that what we believe can be the source of such impressive construction. calm, and peace. \\nOnce you have been filled with awe, depart to see other stunning sections in this complex city, a community comprised of friendly, helpful persons everywhere along the economic spectrum. I personally enjoy pedaling my Doublevision throughout Cd. Juarez/Valle de Juarez/Casa de Adobe/etc., and even if you are unable to enjoy such a means of conveyance, walking or bussing can be equally satisfying.

There are no signs, so you don\\'t really get a lot of history about the church unless you are willing to research prior to arriving, but it is still a nice place to visit.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Catedral de Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/07/bf/71/catedral-de-nuestra-senora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Vicente Guerrero, Plaza de Armas", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Juarez", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Museo_de_Arqueologia_El_Chamizal-Ciudad_Juarez_Northern_Mexico": {"572506588": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Family Visit", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150780-d4985216-Reviews-Museo_de_Arqueologia_El_Chamizal-Ciudad_Juarez_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/a5/35/18/small-sculptures.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "One of my favorites places, Need some Restauration, but nonless still is good, no matter that pieces they Show are just replicas. and is free", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Museo de Arqueologia El Chamizal", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/a5/35/18/small-sculptures.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av.

There is a relatively small Northern Cultures section inside along with gallery space (e.g. there was an exhibit of contemporary paintings). The real stuff is outside. The museum have a very nice and big garden (park) and the artifacts are spread around the walkway in the park. As you are walking through the park, you are passing in front of the artifacts which I believe are the replicas from various sites all around Mexico. So, in a sense, you are getting a taste, in a nutshell, of all the sites of Mexico. There is also a replica of an ancient Indian adobe house. \\nThe museum is part of the very large El Chamizal park complex with different attractions, so if you have time and if the weather is nice you can continue to other stuff in and around the park. For example, in the middle of the museum walk, I saw a zip-line, but I did not have time, so I did not ask (there was no activity at the time, but it was a weekday).\\nIf you have time in Cd.

On the plus side it was good to see lots of people out and about at the park.  There also appears to be security at the park.  Also food if you want it. On the negative side, the grass is not maintained so it is rapidly eroding away.  Lots of trash. The lake is not a good color - should a lake be green and opaque?

Call of the Seventy and president of the Mexico North Area, presided and spoke at the groundbreaking ceremony of the Ciudad Ju\\u00e1rez temple\\u2014the state\\'s second. While speaking, Elder Call testified that temples are evidence of Church members\\' belief in life beyond the grave. He informed members that each child, youth and adult member in the temple district would receive a picture of the temple to remind them of the sacred nature of the building.&quot;We live in an historic period in the Church and in the world, when the president of the Church has announced that 30 temples will be built,&quot; said Elder Call. Whenever the Lord has permitted the fullness of the gospel to be present on the earth, temples have existed. They are sacred buildings dedicated to a sacred work. He pointed out that the decision to construct a temple in that location was one of inspiration. President Gordon B. Hinckley selected the site as one for the temple. &quot;This was not my decision. The decision was made by him.&quot;\\n\\nElder Call informed members that instructions had come to move forward rapidly on construction and to prepare for the dedication. &quot;I suppose,&quot; he said, &quot;that within a year we will complete this beautiful edifice and begin to function as a House of the Lord.&quot; Because of this, &quot;We want to be prepared and attend the temple, not just to have the temple as a monument,&quot; he said. This kind of preparation will bring the members more faith, purity, cleanliness, integrity, love and dedication to the callings they hold. &quot;In this temple district, we have members on both sides of the border. This will bring a uniting and joining of members on both communities. This temple is a great thing for members in the United States as well.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Never have I been so filled with joy as at this moment.&quot; H\\u00e9ctor Escobar Alcantar, patriarch of the El Paso Texas Stake, stated that in 1936, Ciudad Ju\\u00e1rez received its first meetinghouse, and now, 63 years later, is receiving a temple. &quot;The Lord has revealed to our beloved prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, that a temple should be built in this part of His vineyard.

Even a few bars, but would not suggest a night-time visit here.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "City Market", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/20/5e/ac/mini-mercado-de-artesanias.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av. 16th de Septiembre", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Juarez", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "160201610": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Lots to see and do, very colorful", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150780-d271970-Reviews-City_Market-Ciudad_Juarez_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/20/5e/ac/mini-mercado-de-artesanias.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Amazing, different, lots to buy, negotiable on most prices, watch your pockets as pick pockets really do exsist", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "City Market", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/20/5e/ac/mini-mercado-de-artesanias.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av. 16th de Septiembre", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Juarez", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "143581399": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "definitely an experience!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150780-d271970-Reviews-City_Market-Ciudad_Juarez_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/20/5e/ac/mini-mercado-de-artesanias.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Stayed in El Paso for business and decided to go over to Juarez and experience the shopping and culture... got some really good deals and it was overall a very exciting day.

I bought a beautiful sculpture made out of bone for my sister and talked the guy down from a starting price of 27 US dollars down to 10 US dollars.  It helps to know what kind of price you would pay for such an item in the US and then go lower.  Have fun with the people, they are all very friendly and just trying to make a living.

The hecticness of the market is just part of Mexican culture and it\\'s like that all over Mexico, so its not just a tourist thing on the border.  There are nice ceramics, glassware, tin mirrors, talavera dishes and pottery, and some interesting wall hangings there.  Of course there is the tipico tourist crap too like a tshirt about drinking tequila, but you don\\'t have to buy it!  You do get bugged whenever you start looking at stuff, so my recommendation is go in with an idea of what you would like to buy, that way you aren\\'t overwhelmed and confused about all the possibilities when you are there.  I also walk by and just sort of glance at stuff, noticing what catches my eye, and then if I am interested, I will come back and ask about it.  It is true that once you ask about something they really want to make a sale and will bug you about it.  If you don\\'t want it though, just say no thanks and start ignoring the guy.  Everyone else does it too, Mexicans included, so don\\'t feel bad.  Also, when they give me a price I offer 1/2.  Then they start bartering with me.  That also is part of the culture, and the haggling over the price is part of the sale.  I go low and have them work me back up in price in increments.  Never pay the first price offered, or even the second.  After that, it depends.  If I think the price offered is fair, I will get it.  If I think it is unreasonable, I just walk away.  They will come down if they want a sale.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "City Market", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/20/5e/ac/mini-mercado-de-artesanias.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av. 16th de Septiembre", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Juarez", "addressRegion": "Northern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "7636835": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Be prepared!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150780-d271970-Reviews-City_Market-Ciudad_Juarez_Northern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/20/5e/ac/mini-mercado-de-artesanias.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "My husband and I went to the City Market just last week.
