We didn\\'t go on a hired trip, and instead drove our rental car there. We wore the heck out of our tiny economy rental, and looking back- getting a larger car or jeep would have been ideal for this trip (though we saw plenty of tour buses make the journey) the drive itself takes a bit longer than expected because of the roads (which can be scary- some paved, some dirt, lots of severe inclines and sharp turns) but the towns you drive through are very cool and welcoming. Just go slow, and try not to white knuckle it. We ended up picking up a guide from one of the many outposts along the way (you\\'ll see guys with lanyards holding up a laminated tour sheet) which was not something we had ever done before!  He was super friendly and helpful he didn\\'t speak any English, but clearly worked for the parks department and was super cool and helpful. No bad vibes at all, and he seemed to genuinely care about showing us around. Theodoro knew all of the native flora and fauna, and took us on a truly magical tour of the many waterfalls here, even swimming with us and taking us up the many waterfalls. it was an amazing experience and so worth it. We didn\\'t pay him either- only tipped him generously at the end and had a great friend for the day. the water is super cold and refreshing- but you do need water shoes.

Not so much.\\n\\nI do want to point out first of all that this excursion is not fun \\u2013 it is extremely dirty and dusty \\u2013 so much so that there are points in the drive where you cannot see the ATV in front of you through the dust.  So do not take anything that you care about \\u2013 sunglasses, clothes, backpack, shoes, etc \\u2013 the dirt doesn\\u2019t come out.  My sunglasses have been ruined \\u2013 it\\u2019s like they\\u2019ve been sandblasted.  My backpack had dust inside it, so my cell phone and camera were dusty.\\n\\nThe \\u201croad\\u201d, \\u201ctrail\\u201d, \\u201cpath\\u201d or whatever they call it up to the falls is dangerous \\u2013 there are holes, gullies, cuts, construction, animals, no guardrails, 50 metre cliffs, etc.  You do not have an opportunity to take in the scenery because the trail is so dangerous.  And finally, the machinery \\u2013 the ATVs are poorly cared for \\u2013 the brakes are suspect, the tires are balding and mechanical pieces were hanging off the bottom and dragging in the dirt beneath two of our 5 ATVs.  Some of them were so old, beaten and mis-used; we could barely go 2 kilometres without having them stall out, so we\\u2019d have to stop to pour water over the sensors because they were overheating.\\n\\nIf you are contemplating taking this trip, beware that the instruction is poor or misleading \\u2013 if you are not very familiar with ATVs, I do not suggest trying it.  The \\u201cinstructor\\u201d \\u2013 Denis \\u2013  talked about snow and ice and bears more than he told us how to use the brakes and throttle or how to drive an ATV.  His long explanation on how to change gears was ridiculous \\u2013 so much so that those in our group driving with automatic transmissions thought that the rear brake was the gear lever.  The sum total on driving instruction was driving.  He talked about it for 5 or 10 minutes, made us sign a waiver and we got on our machines and left.\\n\\nOn the trip, about 5 kilometers into the drive, my wife, who I was following, braked on a downhill (I saw her brake light come on), and her machine jerked to the left, didn\\u2019t slow down (the brake light was on the whole time), and proceeded to drive her off a 60 or 70 foot cliff.  Thankfully, she had the presence of mind to jump off at the last second and she caught the lip of the cliff with her hands or else she would have gone over too.\\n\\nThe second guide and I were able to help her up and alert the others.  They ran back as a tour bus (from the same company, coincidentally), arrived.  The first thing Denis said as he arrived was, \\u201cthat\\u2019s why they shouldn\\u2019t allow beginners on this tour.\\u201d  Very nice.  With the help of some of the tourists, we were able to push the ATV out from the bottom of the gully, back onto the road.  There was damage to the transmission but my wife wasn\\u2019t too keen on continuing the tour anyway.  But Denis\\u2019 quick check of the mechanicals determined that the ATV had been perfectly safe and that the cause of the accident was driver error.  (Yes this is sarcasm).  The tour bus driver offered to take my wife the rest of the way to the falls.  At no point was there any medical assistance or supplies offered \\u2013 they had none.\\n\\nWe finished the tour up and walked to the falls \\u2013 my wife was in obvious pain and still bleeding, with some pretty significant bruises already appearing.  The bus driver got her a shot of Mescal at the top, that\\u2019s it.  She washed herself off in the river.\\n\\nNone of us in our group were too keen on driving back, given how crappy the conditions were and how poorly the machines were maintained, but we didn\\u2019t have much choice.  When we arrived at the final checkpoint, I was informed by Denis that my wife\\u2019s machine had been picked up and taken to the local ATV dealership.  Given that my wife was on a separate bus, I said that I did not want to deal with that right now and I wanted to see my wife, back at our resort.  I made that quite clear.  Nonetheless, our pick up bus stopped at the dealership where we were met by a Paradiso Huatulo company representative and the company lawyer.  They presented me with a repair quote (interesting that they quoted without having a key to start the machine (Denis had it in his pocket when we arrived)).  It was pretty apparent that they wanted me to pay immediately because the company representative arrived with a credit card machine in her hand and told me how much I had to pay.\\n\\nWhen I said no, take me back to the resort, the lawyer threatened to keep me in the country and they all continued to press me to pay.  Eventually they allowed the bus driver to take us to the resort, where the company representative and the lawyer ganged up on me again.  One of my friends had to get the manager of the hotel to intervene and to force them to agree to a meeting the next morning.\\n\\nThe next morning, the lawyer handed both my wife and I an order, signed by the local police, forbidding us from leaving Mexico.  It also indicated that we were to appear in court the next afternoon (we were schedule to leave the next morning).  They brought the same repair quote from the night before \\u2013 no additional examination of the machine had occurred, so it was obvious that this amount was a complete fabrication.\\n\\nTo make peace and to not have to spend our final day in a legal meeting, after an hour of very heated arguing, I offered to pay half of the quote \\u2013 that we would accept half of the issue, if they accepted their half.  They said no.  After another \\u00bd hour, we agreed to an amount and I paid, once the rep. was able to come up with the credit card machine.  It took another 10 hours and two visits from the lawyer to come up with the release form, allowing us to leave \\u2013 he was able to spell our names correctly to keep us in the country, but couldn\\u2019t seem to spell them to allow us out.\\n\\nOverall, this was an absolutely terrible experience.  The injuries, the literal possible death or severe injury to my wife, the legal repercussions and pressure, the trail conditions, the instruction, the equipment were all ghastly.  I frankly could not imagine a worse experience while on holiday.\\n\\nI hope that I have been clear - DO NOT TAKE THIS TOUR.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "1"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Magic Falls", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9d/fb/81/photo5jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ninguna Santa Cruz Huatulco", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "566349534": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Magic Falls (Emerald Falls?)", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d639959-Reviews-Magic_Falls-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9d/fb/81/photo5jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "What a beautiful destination!

Firstly, I\\'d like to say that everything Crisanto said was true....but I\\'m going to fill in the gaps with regard to our &quot;Coffee Plantation and Magic Waterfalls&quot; excursion. \\n- The trip is going to take about 6 hours in total. We left our hotel around 10:30 and didn\\'t get back until 5:30. \\n- The roads up to the coffee plantation and Magic Waterfalls are some of the worst you can imagine. Logging roads in British Columbia are like paved freeways compared to these. Wouldn\\'t recommend anyone with back problems/mobility issues/problems sitting for a considerable period go on these roads. Our tour guide had to shut off the air conditioning to get enough power in spots to go up the various grades. \\n- The coffee plantation is just a store-front operation. Yes there is coffee trees there and some young lads will give you a photo opportunity in exchange for a tip. The whole setup here is to get you to taste/buy mescal, coffee and chocolate. Don\\'t buy coffee in paper bags by the way....only vacuum packed as the air gets in too easily and buy only beans. We bought our coffee and Mescal in Crucecita after shopping around and getting advice.\\n- On the return trip, we went to the Magic Waterfalls. Until this point, the four of us were thinking we wasted $100CDN and 3 1/2 hours of our life that we\\'d never get back. They are beautiful and great to swim in and by far the BEST point of the whole excursion!\\n- The lunch afterward at a local family owned place was also fantastic! Fresh pork and chicken, rice and homemade tortillas and cold drinks. Very tasty and two thumbs up. Will post pictures. \\nSo in conclusion.... The coffee plantation part of trip 1 out of 5. I\\'ve been to coffee plantations and it\\'s misleading to put this store-front setup into that category. Next time I\\'ll do the the Cafe Puma plantation and check it out. The waterfalls 4 out of 5 and the meal was 4 out of 5. We\\'re glad the Waterfalls saved the day, but is sure is a long bumpy, winding and difficult road to get there and when bundled with the &quot;coffee plantation&quot; it took a good chunk out of our day.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Magic Falls", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9d/fb/81/photo5jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ninguna Santa Cruz Huatulco", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "550521880": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Long bumpy journey in and back", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d639959-Reviews-Magic_Falls-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9d/fb/81/photo5jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Almost 2 hours each way but the falls are beautiful.

Having a 9 month old, I approached reps on 3 separate occasions to ask if excursion was appropriate for infants and was told baby would be fine. They explained that it was a 90 minute drive in an air conditioned van to the Falls and when we arrived we would have to walk about 15 minutes to the Falls; although not suitable for a stroller, baby could be carried. I was concerned about the bugs and was told they weren\\'t too bad. Fair enough...I packed my baby harness for the walking part and a mosquito net to drape over baby and off we went. So here is an account of our day....\\nLeft our hotel at 9:00 am and began our drive in a van with air conditioning hitting the driver and first row but noone else (we were at the back). The road (if you can call it that) was so bumpy and windy that you rocked all over the place and out of you seat for the entire duration of the drive. It was so jarring that I had to hold my son\\'s head and neck steady for the entire drive which took....3 1/2 hours in total!!! We made 2 stops enroute to purchase local crafts and coffee/honey etc. Everyone was friendly and welcoming (you should bring a few hundred pesos to support the local communities). We drove through little villages which was very eye opening (didn\\'t see one kid with his head stuck to an iphone :) ) The available washrooms were out in the open and if you go, please remember to bring your own tissues/wipes as no toilet paper provided!!! The driver was from the area and gave an interesting commentary of life on the mountain. We arrived at the Falls at 12:30 pm - 3 1/2 hours since departure!!!!! We were offered bottled water and nothing else. So I put baby in the harness and we headed to the Falls. The walk with baby was do-able. Again, winding and bumpy but ok. We made our first stop (of 3) at what I would describe as a small brook. Spent about 15 minutes there while visitors waded in the water. There was no place to put baby down as the area very rocky.  It was challenging to carry baby into water because the rocks were slippery so I stood at the edge. Then we moved to next area (another 10 minute walk) where there was an opportunity for guests to jump off rocks. My husband and eldest daughter did the 2 story jump, but beware - the water is not very deep and the jump is very close to rocks. Other that a couple of benches, there was no where to put baby down again. Water entry not appropriate when holding a baby due to slippery rocks. W were there for about 20 minutes. The third stop was finally the Falls. The kids could swing on a rope into the water. There were a few more narrow benches to sit on but there were at least 4 groups there so space was at a premium. I had to sit for the third time with baby in lap on a narrow bench. I had thought that once we finally arrived at the Falls there would be an area for visitors to spread out and enjoy the afternoon but not to be the case. The Falls were okay but nothing spectacular. We have waterfalls up north that are comparable. We stayed for about 30 minutes then made our way back for lunch (quite a hike uphill). When we finally sat down for lunch it was 3:00 pm. We were all starving as we hadn\\'t eaten since breakfast. The lunch was really good and there was lots to go around. If you wanted a beer, you had to pay 25 pesos. We returned to the van at 4:00 pm to make our descent down the treacherous mountain and arrived back at our hotel just before 6:00 pm.\\n\\nBy no means so I want to dissuade anyone from going to the Falls but I think the Sunwing Reps should have provided us all with a much better description of what to expect. I never thought we would spend 5 1/2 hours in a bus, or that we would be eating lunch at 3:00 pm or we would only be spending only about 30 minutes at the Falls. I would not have gone with a baby if I had had more information but for some, the excursion may be a great day out. My 12 years old daughter loved the day. I was stressed out holding baby and making sure his head wasn\\'t bouncing around too much. It was a long day, not much to eat until late and not even a complimentary beer!\\n\\nWould recommend you put sunscreen and bug spray on while at the bus then leave it on the bus. Only take a towel, a bottle of water with you and you should really wear water shoes. Flip flops were the best for walking in the rocky water. Bring lots of snacks with you to eat on the way (as long as you don;t get motion sickness).\\n\\nWon\\'t do this one again but some may enjoy!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Magic Falls", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9d/fb/81/photo5jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ninguna Santa Cruz Huatulco", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "468707136": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Very beautiful place it is magic", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d639959-Reviews-Magic_Falls-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9d/fb/81/photo5jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "It was very nice trip, my husband me were very impressed of how clean the water was and warm never saw this water falls before somewhere else  ", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Magic Falls", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9d/fb/81/photo5jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ninguna Santa Cruz Huatulco", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "468669310": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "BEAUTIFUL, MUST SEE ONCE!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d639959-Reviews-Magic_Falls-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9d/fb/81/photo5jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Good experience, but lots of climbing up and down rocks...so if you have mobility issues, this is not for you.

These falls are nestled away in the middle of a tropical wonderland.  It takes about an hour on a dirt road to reach your destination but once you arrive it\\'s like paradise.  \\n\\nThe best way to enjoy this adventure is to hire a private guide to take you to this remote utopia.  The major tour companies won\\'t take you to the falls due to the bumpy dirt road.  I hired Huatulco\\'s Edgar Escobar (find him on Facebook) to guide me to this amazing destination.  \\n\\nThe falls are like nothing I\\'ve seen before and Edgar was so informative about the local culture and history.  The main waterfall has access to a cave where you can actually walk behind the waterfall and get a very unique view.  There is an area to swim (a little chilli) that offers crystal clear waters. The waterfalls are actually tiered so you can walk through the different levels.\\n\\nAfter a refreshing swim, we walked to the restaurant (2 minutes) where we had one of the best lunches I\\'ve had on my entire vacation.  Edgar speaks perfect English and is able to explain the various selections on the menu.  I found that very few people speak English in Huatulco so having Edgar as a guide was a huge asset.\\n\\nAfter lunch, we went to the coffee plantation where I bought coffee beans, chocolate and honey.  Yum Yum.  You can easily spend 4-6 hours at the waterfall just taking in the natural beauty of the area.  I highly recommend it.  I would also recommend to have a &quot;private&quot; guide take you rather than going with a group.

This is a great trip for curious minds because our guide,  who was fantastic, was so very knowledgeable about the plants and trees we saw on the way and made a point of stopping on the way to point out fascinating stuff to us. Some in the group just wanted to get on with it, but to us this was the perfect way to enjoy the journey, not just the end game. The falls themselves were absolutely gorgeous. We felt we were in a tarzan movie or something...everything was lush with weird rock formations and these amazing pools of water we were able to swim in. The climb up the various falls was arduous and we really did not think we would be able to make it. We are older people (by far the oldest in our small group), but our guides assured us we could make it and said they would help us and keep us safe, which they did. We felt such a sense of fulfillment that we made the hard climb and enjoyed it immensely. We were not even sore the next day, maybe because swimming in the cold water of the falls was like putting an ice pack on the over-worked muscles. Both guides were amazingly kind and helpful, but Josuay was truly the best!! One recommendation is to bring aqua shoes to prevent slipping on the wet rocks while climbing.

It\\'s a long drive on a super bumpy dusty dirt road. About 1 1/2 hours to the first falls. (We didn\\'t go any further). \\n\\nWe were not sure what to expect so we brought our own lunch and cold water and beer. Our phone/camera. By the way, no cell service. \\n\\nWe got to the first falls which was not entirely easy to find. Fortunately we didn\\'t get lost. \\n\\nThere were a couple of forks in the road without signs. Stay to the right. There are little spots where the locals jump out with flash cards offering to be a guide. \\n\\nThey charged 70 Pesos per person when you came to a roped area of the road. Which is mandatory. They give you a receipt. \\n\\nThe first falls was called Las Brisas then Magic Falls apparently was further up the road. \\n\\nI would recommend to bring no valuables and wear good shoes to walk the trails. A waterproof pouch for your cash.  \\n\\nWhen you go onto the bridge decks be very careful and hold the rope provided. My husband slipped on the bridge and fell and lost his glasses right at the largest falls. Miraculously, after digging around in the water thankfully he found them. \\n\\nBring extra glasses if you have them. He was the driver!  So we were lucky. \\n\\nMy husband ventured into the hole to get in behind the falls. There were too many people inside so it was not really worth it, especially after he fell! \\n\\nWe walked back and found the most beautiful little spot to have a picnic, kind of off to the side before the main falls. \\n\\nThere are a couple of ropes to swing from, we didn\\'t try them but the kids around us did. \\n\\nEven though the roads were sketchy, we were so glad we went. It was so beautiful and natural. \\n\\nIf you don\\'t bring a lunch with you, there are a couple of little places to eat. \\n\\nDon\\'t go past the bathrooms! There is one where you park, and one just up by the falls. They look a little questionable too, but there was a sink to wash your hands. \\n\\nIf you have not gone to the falls I highly recommend it. Wear those water shoes perhaps. Leave valuables at home or in you trunk of your car. Watch your step and carry extra glasses!

Can\\'t remember how many falls we saw but lots of them.\\n Went with the Sunwing wing tour. Around $65 US when combined with the snorkel and bays tour so $130 for both. We left from Secrets at 8:50 am with a quick stop at Dreams. Nice clean mini van with very good AC.There were 7 of us. Our guide was with Oscar and he is just an amazing guy.\\nThe ride takes you along a 26km road from the turn off on hwy 200  towards the airport. The first 5km are paved and a few in the middle through some of the villages have been also. The road was freshly graded through the hillside. Not nearly as bad as I expected. This was May.\\n We stopped along the way at a couple of villages and to take pictures of the Copalita river. Our ride was just under 2 hours but very leisurely. Oaxaca is one of the poorest states in Mexico and is was very heart warming to see how simple everyone lives.\\n We visited 2 main areas of the falls. It was a 10 minute walk to the first one. The second one a little more adventurous but not far. We did not use water shoes but some might want to as some sections are slippery.\\n Going through caves and inside a couple of the water falls was so much fun.  We had lots of time to swim and take pictures. The water was so refreshing as it was so hot outside. Tons of shade so no worries.  I would recommend a basic water proof camera to take with you for the best pictures. They have a place to buy drinks, beer and snacks.\\n There we not many people and at times we had the falls to ourselves or with only a few others..  \\nA nice lunch was provided in a private jungle setting with bbq steak and veggies .So good. One has to try the hibiscus juice.\\n On the way back we did  lots of coffee, chocolate beans and  Mescal tasting as well as other things and I bought lots of stuff.  Oscar also brought us to his home he is slowly building and met his young family. What a wonderful man.\\n We were back at Secrets before 5pm.

A wonderful day.  No only did we learn a lot about the communities on the road to the falls but also had fun at the falls and had a delicious meal followed by a hands on explanation of coffee processing.\\nA few things to know before you go:  It is about a 10 hour day and we did not eat until 3:30 so pack some water and snacks.  Wear your bathing suit but take a change of clothes so you are not sitting in a wet bathing suit after the falls.  Bring water shoes to change into.  The rocks are slippery.  There are rudimentary changing rooms with dirt floors.  Bring extra money for tips, snacks, coffee beans and mud masks.  There were no mosquitos when we were there in March but don\\'t know about other times of the year.  \\nPick up for the trip is at your hotel.  We went in a van and there were 10 of us - 8 Mexicans and 2 Canadians (us).  Our guide Juan-Carlos was excellent.  He spoke good English and gave interesting explanations of the country-side as we made our 2 hour trip to the falls.  It is 30 km up a narrow winding dirt road with many pot holes and large rocks.  Some of the route wound its way up treed mountains and some through villages of cement houses. There were also areas of planted cactus and corn as well as coffee trees.  We stopped 1/2 way up the mountain to learn about natural herbal remedies from a flamboyant Spanish speaking man of about 58 who had cures from cervical cancer to arthritis.  We tasted organic honey, mescal and our legs were sprayed with a mixture of marijuana and water apparently to aid circulation.  \\nOn our way up the mountain we passed the entrance to Magic Falls.  The two sights are on the Copalitilla river which I assume is a tributary of the Copalita river - the largest river of the Huatulco area.   \\nOnce the van was parked we had a short walk up and down some hills on a dirt path by the river until we came to the 1st falls.  There was a wooden platform from which one could jump 8 meters into 3 meters of water or continue down the path and wade into the water, up the rocks of the waterfall to jump off around 3 meters of height.  At the second falls there was a rope suspended from a tall tree above the falls.  Once you climbed up the water falls you could swing and land in the pool of water.  Lots of fun for my 12 year-old son.  Both falls were beautiful and under each of them was a small cave.  Once you ventured under the cascading water you were treated to a view of miniature stalactites dripping with water.  At the first falls our faces were covered with a red clay paste that we then washed off at the second falls.\\nAfter changing out of wet bathing suit and shoes our group took the path up the hill again to our lunch place where we were fed chicken in mole sauce, favorful pork pieces, black beans, rice and tortillas - cookies for dessert. There was also shots of mescal to taste and a fruit punch drink.  Beer could be had for 25 pesos.  Lunch was followed by an explanation of coffee processing in a shed where the beans were roasted.  There was then opportunity to buy the organic beans, red mud paste and other herbal products produced in the region. Then on to the van and on our way.  We were back at the resort by 7 p.m.  A satisfying and worthwhile outing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Magic Falls", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9d/fb/81/photo5jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ninguna Santa Cruz Huatulco", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "360379276": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Quite a hike from the Resorts but worth it!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d639959-Reviews-Magic_Falls-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/9d/fb/81/photo5jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We used a service that we found in La Crucecita - very minimal cost and got a REAL Mexican experience.

The guide/driver didn\\'t know how to do this and a couple of the guys helped him out and did it for him.

When we were picked up again by the van I checked out the tires and found that they were 3 different brands and 2 were worn out.

The waterfalls themselves are great. These are not towering waterfalls where the water drops 100\\' or anything, but they are fun to swim in, and walk up. There is a cave you can climb into and they climb up through the rushing water and out a different location. The cave is only for people that can pull themselves up a steep rock face using a rope, otherwise the rest of the waterfalls are reasonable easy to climb. The river is cool but clear and fresh and fantastic to swim in, once you get used to the water temperature. The walk back to the parking lot is much shorter and downhill most of the way so very easy. The food if you decide to also have lunch there is delicious and authentic Oaxacan so worth having lunch there. Over all a great tour and location.

He really made a great day for us!  There were enough of us to fill one van, so it became a bit of a private tour which was special.\\nEveryone talks about how rough the drive is - it really is.  It\\'s 90 minutes + of off pavement driving up steep terrain.  If you get car sick, take some anti-nausea medication.  I did and it really helped.  The best part of the drive, though, is the communities you get to become a small part of as you drive through them.  \\nOnce we reached the top, we were served (great!!) coffee (that you can purchase later after the tour - not pushy, though) and cookies.  Then we drove about 5 minutes further to a parking lot and hiked into the falls.  It is an extremely easy walk, but it is about 20 minutes or so with roots and rocks on the trail.  Once you arrive at the first falls (there are two... and Tomas timed it out so we missed the larger crowds due to the long weekend - thank you Tomas!), you can jump from a large drop (about 30 feet), scale up a rope or simply swim.  It is breathtaking - feels like you\\'re right in a movie.  Great photo ops!  Then, if you want, you can move to the larger second set of falls.  The water is very cold, but not a big deal if you\\'ve swam in mountain water before.  If you\\'re lucky, you\\'ll also get a clay facial mask (try it!) and then after washing off, head back down to the main area near the parking lot for lunch.  \\nLunch is great - I was impressed.  We had hibiscus juice, tortillas, chicken mole, pork, black beans, cactus salad, homemade hot sauce, rice... so good.  They served jello for dessert which was not my thing, but whatever.  They also serve drinks, but those are extra $ which we didn\\'t mind!  Victoria beer is the best in Mexico!\\nAfter lunch we went for a walk around the property, then a quickie tour of the coffee and mescal they make.  The coffee is fantastic (bought a LOT) and the mescal that was surprisingly good (as I\\'m not really a fan) was the coffee mescal!  \\nThe day was long, but fantastic.

Made this trip on February 27th, 2015 with two vehicles. (Nissan Xterra and stock Chevy Venture minivan with 6 people). Fortunately the road had been graded at some point since the last rainy season -with the exception of the steep final 5 km.  Roads were easily navigable by both vehicles. We drove about 1:45, driving very slowly for comfort and to minimize car-sickness. The road was good, and the scenery along the way interesting. Tip: Honk your horn when crossing the long concrete bridge over the river, and three delightful little boys will come running out to sell home-made tamales and other goodies. AT THE FALLS: be prepared to pay an entrance fee at the falls parking area. Access to the falls is through private land, so the families who own the land charge 60 pesos per adult and 20 pesos per child entrance fee. Right or wrong, that\\'s the deal. (Unfortunately we were completely unaware of this, and only had 170 pesos with us -for 5 adults and 4 children. after much discussion the attendant reluctantly took it and wrote us out a receipt). THE FALLS: follow a primitive foot trail along the river and see many cascadas along the way. They claim there are 40. The best ones are at the end, which takes about 10 minutes on foot.  There are ropes to swing off, pools to dive into, a cave with water flowing through it that one can wade through, a cave that goes behind one of the waterfalls, and a little sitting area with a roof for shade.  We were blessed to have the entire place to ourselves all afternoon!

The falls themselves are really a little paradise with multiple locations to swim in crystal clear aquamarine water with lots of butterflies flitting about.

Fortunately, we had a terrific guide who really made our day very enjoyable. Eduardo, also known as Lalo, is a 25 year old guide full of energy, life and love for his country. We were picked up at 8:20 am and returned at about 5:00. On our way to Magic Falls we visited an iguana farm where we also saw how corn tortillas are made and even participated in making one. We then travelled to a herbology farm to learn how the Huatulcan people use their flora to create medicines for all kinds of aches, pains and illnesses. Finally we headed toward Magic Falls. It is a very long, bumpy and winding drive - not very pleasant for anyone with motion sickness. Unfortunately three of us were feeling very queasy once we got there. As far as the falls, they are very small and being from Canada where fresh water and waterfalls are bountiful and magnificent, Magic Falls was not very impressive. The hike was nice though and we saw some beautiful birds and butterflies along the way. Another negative was how freezing cold the water was. I went in to my knees and couldn\\'t stand it for more than 5 min. One of my boys did try the Tarzan rope and enjoyed climbing behind the waterfall despite the cold water. \\nLuckily we had some gravol for our return trip, which helped quite a bit. \\nA nice day, but would not repeat or recommend this excursion.

We thoroughly enjoyed the hike and the beautiful surroundings. This is the real deal - you see and feel nature as it should be all around you.\\n\\nWe also got the meal that they offer after the trek (I would HIGHLY recommend it) and the authentic mexican food (cucumber salad, rice, tortillas, jalapeno mole with chicken, pork marinated in tamarind, and black beans) along with their hibiscus tea (Agua de Jamaica) and Oaxacan coffee. I purchased the dried flowers and coffee beans because I don\\'t know the next time I\\'ll be back.\\n\\nAlso, we went to the butterfly center where they had native butterflies (HUNDREDS of them) and a nursery where they were growing and hatching butterflies to help conservation. There was small fee to get in.\\n\\nHelpful tips: It\\'d be great if you spoke Spanish as they can speak English, but they are able to tell you more about the place if you speak the language.

We left at 7:30 in the morning and arrived at the falls at 11:30 - most of that time was spent on  a dirt road driving through the jungle.  We were 6 people in a small car - driver and one  passenger up front, 3 in the back, and one in the hatchback!  Far too long a drive for my 71 year old parents.  Same road back, by the way.  The falls were definitely beautiful, but the unexpected lenght of the drive  (we had been told 2 hours which we thought was long) plus the worry about what we would do if something happened to the car so far from the main road, took away much of the pleasure we should have experienced at seeing the stunning jewel deep in the jungle.  We were fortunate in that we were the only visitors at the falls so that did make it very special.  There is also a bit of a walk from the washroom area up to the falls, this could be challenging for the less mobile elderly members of your group.\\n\\nThe coffee plantation part of the tour was not what we had expected - we did see coffee plants growing in the jungle but we had hoped to see more of the actual process involved and had hoped for a larger scale production; the &quot;drying facilities&quot; we saw were beans spread out in the sun on two grass mats.\\n\\nWe would have enjoyed the trip much more if we had been prepared for the long drive and if we had been travelling in a more appropriate vehicle.\\n\\nYou should see it.

There you can strip down to your swim wear and  get into the water to wade, swim, jump in to a pool , sit under cascades or swing from a rope and drop into the water. some people just sat on the benches and watched. The water was clear and cool but i did not get cold after being in it for about 45 minutes. The hike back from the falls was on a different trail which followed the river. it was very senic . From there we went back to the plantation for a lunch of chicken and rice ( very good)  along with wine and tequlia. After lunch our guide Anna walked us threw the grounds showing us the different trees, plants and a few penned deer.

The SA road is at km # 236, about 3 minutes north of the airport road. It took us about 40 minutes to drive from Santa Cruz to the beach. The packed dirt road leading west from the highwsy is a little rough with a few large potholes and many topas which required navigation in first gear. There are 2 or 3 small communities along the way which manage traffic speed by curves and topas, and in which pedestrians are mindful of the vehicles passing by. There are lots of kids, particularly in the evenings and on weekends, so it is probably a good idea to keep it slow through these places.  We didn\\'t see any loose  livestock, so it is not likely an issue. Once out at the beach we saw that everything from small buses and medium sized trucks to motorcycles and micro-cars appear to make the trip without issue. We averaged around 30 kph....locals and taxis seem to go about half that speed, perhaps because they own their rides.\\n\\nThe beaches at this location are clean and free of the flotsam and algae/weed issues seen in many other tourist locations. In the bay area and outside of the park, it is crowded with about 40 eateries, all basically constructed, some two stories high. The access ways behind them are crowded with parking and a row or two of accommodations for &quot;locals&quot;. There are also basic tourist rental cabinas and rooms here, some with a view. The beach to the west of the point which protects the bay is largely without development as it is too shelved for safe swimming or snorkeling from shore. It is easily accessed by walking a few feet from the main road to SA and affords an excellent view of a classic tropical Pacific sunset.\\n\\nThe bay water was cool to warm and clear and calm. It was easy to get into the water because of the gentle shelf and small waves. The coral was OK and the marine life moderate, though somewhat sparse for a live reef.  When we were there in mid-week, there were less than ten people in the water, so it was uncrowded. Given that there wete about the same amount of people in the 40 restaurants, and that at some point they have to be filled to stay in business, we probably chose the right time of day/week/season to visit SA. I think if this place gets crowded, it is probably a zoo. While this might be annoying for some of us, i expect it is downright destructive for the reefs coral flora and fauna. There are no signs or personnel on the beach to instruct the uninformed not to touch the coral. The result is obvious once one submerges.\\n\\nSo....the hidden gem aspect of San Agustin Bay is not the bay, rather it is the sunset across the headland from the bay. It can be observed over rocky outcrops or from a long, open and undeveloped beach. It was well worth the drive and is something you do not have the opportunity to do on a boat tour. The dusk drive back to the Huatulco tourist zone was,  in my opinion safe if done cautiously.\\n\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa San Augustin", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cf/b1/30/playa-san-agustine.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "438555782": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Amazing beach", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d152573-Reviews-Playa_San_Augustin-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cf/b1/30/playa-san-agustine.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Great place to visit with local hut beach restaurants, very clean, not a lot of people known about this place!

As soon as we drove up, vendors started trying to pull you into their parking spots to have you eat at their restuarant.

That area is overrated because again, it\\'s all just pushy restaurant owners trying to drag you into their restaurant, or throw you on their boat. However, I will say that the snorkelling is quite fantastic as there is a very large reef just offshore.\\nI had read about taking a boat to Playa La India (a boat access only beach nearby), so we got a guy on the beach in San Agustin to take us. We did not know how far away Playa La India was, or how much we should be paying, but we wound up paying $800 pesos for two of us. The beach was very close, and had decent snorkelling. It was a pretty beach, and we stayed for probably an hour or so. But in the end, definitely not worth $800 pesos. I\\'d be good with paying half that to get to Playa La India. Otherwise, I would suggest just staying at Bahia San Agustin.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa San Augustin", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cf/b1/30/playa-san-agustine.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "432516403": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful Beach", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d152573-Reviews-Playa_San_Augustin-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cf/b1/30/playa-san-agustine.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The best &amp; biggest bay in Huatulco, huge coral reef great for snorkel, lots of beach palapa  restaurants, great for a day trip since it\\'s 1 hr away, local transportation, also good for camping trip", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa San Augustin", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cf/b1/30/playa-san-agustine.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "419248571": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Lunch &amp; Snorkeling Stopover with Pilo", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d152573-Reviews-Playa_San_Augustin-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cf/b1/30/playa-san-agustine.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We came to Playa San Augustin while we were on an excursion with Pilo.  We stopped here for snorkeling and for lunch at LaLa Restaurant &amp; Bar.  The snorkeling was not the best I have done in Mexico (I preferred the Caribbean side near Tulum and Xpu Ha much better) but we did get to see some cool things...puffer fish, a giant school of yellow tailed surgeon fish, and a really pretty spotted eagle ray to name a few... so it was a nice snorkel opportunity.  The water was calm and clear. Unfortunately some of the coral has not been very well respected though.  It is apparently one of the best spots to snorkel in the Huatulco area.  While we were there a sailfish fishing competition was taking place so there was lots of activity on the beach.  It seemed like a great family place for the locals to come to.  The sand was coarse with lots of coral and shells.  Very pretty area.  I would definitely go back the next time we are in the area and spend a little more time at this lovely beach.  \\n\\nSince LaLa Restaurant and Bar doesn\\'t have itself on the Trip Advisor map yet I will say a few things about it here:\\nBoth tour operators that we used while in Huatulco recommended it (Pilo and Huatulco Tours Enrique) We were greeted at the boat and escorted over to the restaurant and seated right on the beach.  We were brought fresh tostadas and salsa and we ordered a Corona and a Pina Colada right away.  Both of us ordered the stuffed pineapple.  It was a creamy, cheesy, shrimp stuffed half of a broiled pineapple and it was AMAZING!!!!  The service was really good and after our meal we were offered a shot of tequila on the house.  After we finished our meal we were escorted back to the boat.  It was a great place to stop for lunch and we would definitely eat there again when we go back.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa San Augustin", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cf/b1/30/playa-san-agustine.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "417481206": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful beach and excellent sea food", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d152573-Reviews-Playa_San_Augustin-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cf/b1/30/playa-san-agustine.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We visited this beach in a ATV tour.

Our guides led us to a restaurant where we left our things and we immediately jumped into the water. The bay was clear and teeming with fish of all types. We swam for about 15 minutes before noticing that we were surrounded by jellyfish. Because it was getting so uncomfortable, we got out of the water and went to the restaurant for a marguerita, tortillas and pico de gallo ($350 pesos per couple). Not long after we sat down, beach sellers, some accompanied by children, began streaming in, making it difficult to relax and enjoy this quaint little village. The ba\\u00f1os of the restaurant we were at, was probably one of the worst I have seen so far in Mexico. While our experience in San Augustin wasn\\'t great, we were told by a local woman that it should be on our to do list while in Huatulco. She said we should see the church (which we did not have time to) and also check out a resturant there (Churros?) operated by a couple of artists who are helping feed the children in the area.

All different colours of bright fish, and we saw an eel. We loved it here. Definately when travelling huatulco beaches.....bring your own snorkel and mask from home cause every beach has some sort of snorkelling so it\\'s nice to not have to worry about renting and to have a good set with you. We used our sets everyday while on vacation. Worth the investment. Also go to this beach during the weekdays. One day it was like we were the only ones there. When we went on a Saturday it was packed with lots of boats of snorkelling tours coming in. As well, sometimes when coming into beach towns you get surrounded by Mexicans trying to tell you to come to their restaurant. Just don\\'t stop walking....keep trekking to the beach and once you commit to sit down on an area on beach they leave you alone. Last word of advice is bring pesos to the beach restaurants or more remote places with you. Not American money. They will screw you and give you a 1 to 10 exchange rate when banks give you 1 to 13.

On our first trip we hung out at Restaurant Chemeco on the right fork in the road. Our second trip we stayed at Restaurant de los Abuelos on the left fork. Both days we snorkeled and swam and ate good seafood. Prices are high at all the restaurants but you can stay all day and they keep an eye on your things. Snorkeling is okay but there isn\\'t a lot to see compared with the Caribbean... but it was still fun. You can rent snorkel gear and life jackets, if needed. Of the two places I preferred Los Abuelos as the view was great, clean bathrooms were across the street and the palapa roof is large and you feel like there\\'s lots of space around you. At Chemeco there were lots of banana boat rides going on so you felt like you had to watch out for boats while snorkeling.

There was a group of 10 adults.  All was good when we arrived, however, it took a turn for the worse later in the day.  Two very well dressed men and their entourage showed up at about 1 pm in a convertible type hummer vehicle with large speakers blasting.  They pulled right on the beach area.  It started with us watching two jet skis out in the water doing stunts and scaring the people swimming right out of the water and just escalated from there.  The entourage moved into the restaurant where we were seated outside.  They had a &quot;band&quot; come in and play for at least 2 hours.  I love music, however, this wasn\\'t music.  It was a guitar and a tuba player and just absolutely awful.  I think they were just waiting for someone to complain and we were told to keep our thoughts to ourselves.  After about 2 hours, the guy and his &quot;silicone&quot; girlfriend hopped into the hummer vehicle and proceeded to drive directly onto the beach where vendors were set up and children were playing.  They spun around 3 times blowing sand everywhere and knocking down the vendors\\' items.  He then jumped the curb where his vehicle flipped over.  All the Mexican people ran and helped him (Not sure why).  After he left, I asked one of the locals was this cartel and his reply was yes, unfortunately they show up about once a month.  One of the ladies on the beach that was braiding hair just clung onto one of our chairs and was crying profusely.  There was no sign of police anywhere until he had vacated the premises.  I feel so very sorry for the locals who have to put up with this and we were told that cruise ships and tourism was down due to the heavy presence of these losers.  We have been to Huatulco 3 times and I think this will be the last as I felt very intimidated and on edge when they showed up.  Its just so so sad and too bad they don\\'t realize when tourism goes down, then so does the economy of the area.  I realize they are everywhere, but so disheartening to see the locals so scared.  I was so very grateful that one of the children out there playing wasn\\'t hurt or worse killed.

First went by boat. 800 pesos (less than $42), the posted rate on the rate board at the marina in Santa Cruz.  Pleasant pretty short ride around to the next bay.

He took me to snorkel shack and fitted me with gear.  Good mask, ok fins, and cheap snorkel. Worked just fine. They had lockers if you wanted to rent but I just left my stuff in the chair.  They said it would be fine and it was. 100 pesos, less than $6 for all day!  Great snorkeling.  Very calm and huge growths of coral not far from beach. You could just float above coral beds and watch the fish. Lots of color - fish and coral.  Not as much variety as Hawaii but much easier to do and much better than Cozumel.  The second time I went it was by taxi.  Short ride about $10 each way. Plenty of taxis to bring you back.  Taxi dropped off at beach walk and same guy from beach was there to take me to snorkel shack.  This was by far the easier and cheaper route. Water was little more choppy near shore and tide was active.  Still, when I got away from beach activity water was clear and same very good snorkeling experience. If you are traveling with non snorkelers this bay is ideal. Go in the morning and be back and ready to hit it with them before lunch.

A great starter place as the water is calm and you don\\'t have to fight the current too much. \\n\\nTip:  Unless you are planning on eating there, Just take your stuff down to the beach instead of leaving it at a table in one of the restaurants so you don\\'t feel obligated to order a lot of stuff from the menu. Prices seemed a little high since it supposed to be more of a \\'locals\\' hangout. \\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa Entrega", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/75/8e/5c/filename-img-1215-1-jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "384570405": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful Beach!

There are no hotels here, but plenty of restaurants with washrooms, but no wifi--so this is a perfect place to disconnect for a while. If you take a taxi, I suggest asking your driver to retrieve you at a specified time later in the day; he may even make you a deal since you\\'re giving him two fares. Once you arrive, expect to be hounded by restaurant reps and fellows offering snorkeling excursions, but don\\'t be intimidated. Pick the one who is friendliest to you because you\\'ll want a restaurant with a canopy where you can relax and set down your belongings. Our guy said (and was true to his promise) that the does not charge rent for his space and offers safety and security while you\\'re his guest. If you step away to the beach, he keeps an eye on your stuff--again he was true to his word. All he asked is that we order a little food/beverage and a little tip which was a small price to pay as he not only oriented us to the beach and its offerings, but gave us a secure private corner and hooked us up with a snorkeling guide and someone else who rents the equipment. Our guide charged $200 pesos and took us out into the water, showed us and taught us about different fishes; he even took us into a cavern which was really, really cool. The beach and the water are very clean. Once you\\'ve swum or walked out on the beach, enjoy a drink or some lunch at your table, but do expect vendors to come around with jewelry and other assorted artwork. Some of their goods are very nice, but do not hesitate to barter. You may even propose half of their initial prices and be surprised with the bargain to be attained, especially if you buy a quantity of goods. On your way to or from La Entrega, there are a couple of look-out points. Make sure you ask your driver to take you to El Bufadero which is a beach geyser of sorts--which you will not see unless you\\'re in a boat in the water. Although you will not see the geyser, this lookout point has a lighthouse and offers a spectacular view of the sunset if you can make it around that time. If you\\'re going or coming from La Entrega, most drivers will not mind stopping here for a moment while you take a few pictures.

Its only 5 minutes and 60 Pesos from the cetre of Santa Cruz. The beach is not large but easily accomodates even weekend crowds without it getting too cramped. The snorkelling area is well roped off from the boating area. Fish can be viewed almost from the shoreline but become much more prolific and colorful as your approach the reef which is just a few swimming srokes from shore. The rocks on the north side of the bay accomodate a lot of fish also but the waves there can be a bit treacherous for the less robust swimmer.  The coral is quite healthy throughout the reef area .\\nOnce you approach the beach area you will be quickly enlisted to sit at one of the many beach restaurants. This generally includes a table, as many chairs as you need, and an umbrella. For short stays , the price of a few drinks is probably all you will be charged. We stayed for 5 hours or more on each visit and had to pay a &quot;cover charge&quot; of about 100 pesos.It wasnt made apparent up front but was a small price to pay for the day at such a nice beach.\\nPolice patrol the beach and proide a good sense of securtty for you and your belongings.\\nDrinks at the beach run about $2 for beer and fresh juices. Lunch selections of fresh seafood run from $10 to $20 generally.\\nThere were infrequest souvenir sellers but they were pleasant, almost shy, and never persistent.\\nWe came on a Sunday when the beach was mostly populated by local folk.

The beach is lined with restaurant shacks selling basic fish dishes (about 120 pesos, US$10 for a main). One negative is that you can feel a bit harrassed arriving as the waiters try to get you to their restaurants. Weekends can be busy too, weekdays less so. If you don\\'t want to eat you can also leave your stuff at a table at one of the shacks to be looked after while you snorkel, in return for a tip (maybe 30 pesos or so). At the far end of the beach (away from the car parks) the guys offer guided snorkelling trips including diving down to emerge into an underground cave (I didn\\'t try this though). They washed my facemask in soap and bleach to avoid misting up and wouldn\\'t accept any tip! The beach is very well cared for and no fishing is allowed as it is protected. The beach is a short taxi ride from the main hotel area (about 50 pesos I think) and a bit further from the town centre.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa Entrega", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/75/8e/5c/filename-img-1215-1-jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "252273464": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Snorkeling", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d2426230-Reviews-Playa_Entrega-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/75/8e/5c/filename-img-1215-1-jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Went to beach by boat this year and went snorkeling while the guys sat and had a few cold ones on the beach.

Entrega has become a favorite spot for us to snorkel, with the sheltered bay providing calm and warm water!\\n\\nThe cab ride from our hotel (Las Brisas) is about 100 pesos, and takes about 15 minutes to get there. On arrival, we are greeted by a throng of locals trying to get us to go to their restaurant on the beach. There are about 8 or 9 restaurants lined up along the beach with no space in between. Past the restaurants, there is a place to rent snorkel equipment, and also lockers to keep your valuables safe.\\n\\nWe politely navigate past the welcoming committee, and head towards the restaurants. We typically look for a restaurant where the staff speak decent english, and we ask if we can have a table for the afternoon! The staff have ALWAYS given us a great table, and watch our belongings while we snorkel for a couple of hours. Never had a problem! After we\\'re done, we dry off and go back to the restaurant for lunch, where they are eager to bring us drinks and a menu! Most of the menus are the same here, and the food is good. No matter what restaurant you go to, they bring you crisp taco chips, and salsa. Guacamole costs extra. I highly recommend the garlic butter fish fillets or fajitas. Everything is prepared fresh, to order, and doesn\\'t take very long!\\n\\nThe snorkelling at Entrega is excellent! There is a huge reef area just off the beach, and it\\'s protected from water traffice by a line of buoys. There are lots of colorful fish to be seen here. To the north side of the bay, there is a &quot;bat cave&quot;, which is a small cave in the side of the cliffs, and it\\'s only accessible by water. It\\'s a popular attraction, so you may have to wait your turn to get inside. I highly recommend a decent underwater camera ( we use Lumix TS3 ) as well as a small envelope of soda crackers to take along and attract small fish. If you peel open the crackers, you\\'ll get about 20 mins of enjoyment out of it, as the cracker mush slowly oozes out!\\n\\nWhile you sit in the restaurant, or on the beach, you\\'ll get frequent visits from local merchants, selling everything from sea shells, to jewelry, to raw oysters on the half-shell. Never tried the oysters, but much of the other stuff is alot cheaper than you\\'d pay in shops in town. So if you see something you like, negotiate a price and buy it!\\n\\nA typical afternoon at Entrega will last about 3-4 hrs, depending on how long we snorkel. There are plenty of cabs waiting to take you back to your hotel.

The three things we enjoyed most about the area was that the weather is very good.  Not as much rain and for the most part is dependable. I don\\'t want to go somewhere and find out later thats its known for its unpredictablity weatherwise.  The people are incredibly friendly.  WE booked a private cruise to take us to the bays and this really is a must see if you are going to be visitng this area.  White sandy beaches, warm water and really great snorkelling.  We brought our own snorkels etc but we didn\\'t have to...all the tour guide businesses supply you with equipment.  ONe thing I would recommend is that you bring your own lunch from where you are staying.  They will package you up a lunch for around 7$-$9.....much cheaper than allowing your tour guide to take you to the overinflated restaurants on the various beaches.  IT cost us $16 for pineapple juice in the shell of the pineapple. Thats ridiculous.  I didn\\'t bother looking at the price because normally everything is fairly reasonable...but the tour guides make a profit from their friends that own these businesses so just be aware of this before you go and make it clear to them that you either want to chose where you are going to eat (check out the prices ) or you will bring your own picnic lunch.  Other than that we loved our vacation and can\\'t wait to get back and enjoy this gem of an area another time!  :)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Buceo Scuba Huatulco", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/5e/2c/a6/bahias-huatulco-mexico.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Ocotillo 206 Sector H", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "70987", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "285177020": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful, beautiful!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d545894-Reviews-Buceo_Scuba_Huatulco-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/5e/2c/a6/bahias-huatulco-mexico.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Our cruise ship pulled into the small enclosed harbour and we disembarked, only to quickly return to get out bathers and towels. \\nA beautiful swimming beach lay invitingly at the end of the pier and so we plunged in to the clear cooling waters.\\nIt was unexpectedly amazing so we spent the day alternating between the beachside eateries and the cool Pacific.

My only complaint is that those people walking around that appeared to be either supervisors or management never engaged with the guests.

He takes you on a small boat (that he paddles) to a small island rampant with big beautiful iguanas! The guide takes you to various enclosures of animals that they are rehabilitating or some which were rescued and are unable to be released. It was very humbling to see all of the projects they are working on. \\nThe turtle sanctuary was amazing, a bit sad to see the turtles in small enclosures however some were being raised or rescued to be re-released. It is also important to note that due to the hurricane they were still rebuilding and many tanks/enclosures were temporary. \\nStopped at a cosmetic factory (?) that was started by the woman that owns the Body shop. She helped to teach the locals how to make environmentally friendly cosmetics. Did a small tour and picked up some gifts/souvenirs. \\nOn the way back we stopped at two beaches. One of Mexico\\'s only nudist beach, beautiful whether you are into it or not. The second beach we stopped at (I cant remember the name) was beautiful, great snorkeling, great food. \\nOverall this was probably our favorite excursion.

It cost me $ 200.00 to repair it and I paid over $ 300.00 then what it was worth. That is what 3 other mechanics told me. Jerry acts like he is your friend but he is business practices are bad.

This year was the year for dolphin adventures, as I have never seen as many in prior trips.  While the lines were out on the back of the boat we drove for miles with the dolphins along the boat.  The highlight of my first full day in paradise was getting to experience the adventure of bringing in the fabulous sailfish that I have been waiting for.  The fight was tough and it challenged me like never before.  With the coaching of my captain and David the first mate at the video camera, I have experienced the thrill of catch and release with a fish that Crisanto estimated to be about 35 kg.  Snorkeling in San Augustine Bay is always on the \\u201cTo Do List\\u201d as the large schools of fish are always easy to find.

The sea had been quite rough for the past several days but then calmed right down. We caught one sailfish, about 60-70 lbs. we didn\\'t weigh it as we took and few pics and released it. Had another sailfish on but lost it, and had a black marlin chase our bait for 10 minutes but wouldn\\'t take the bait. Just another fantastic day on the water with Crisanto and David in &quot;New Adventure&quot;. A small panga boat but really comfortable for spending the day fishing. Lots of dolphins and turtles as usual. We were out about 12 miles but they have been having a lot of luck closer to shore as well. We have done fishing tours and bay tours with Crisanto for 5 years now and highly recommend him if you want to spend a day on water, either fishing or a bay tour. Great guys that speak very good English and won\\'t leave you thirsty.

A group of 8 did a full day excersion including snorkling and a little fishing. Our guide Roberto was amazing. It was a great choice going with a local as opposed to a giant guided tour because he showed us things that we never would have seen without an experienced guide. He was even kind enough to share with others who were not part of our excersion what he had found. We went to nemerous different spots that each had there own unique life, which again is not likely on a \\'hotel size\\' tour. The day of snorkling was great for all of us. The next day the 3 guys from our group went out fishing with Roberto. We cought fish near the shore in the early morning and then went out far in the afternoon. We landed a huge MahiMahi which we then had the chef at our resort cook, along with some of the other fish we had cought. The experience was great and it was a pleasure spending a day and learning from someone who knows so much about the ocean.\\n\\nBasically, I was nervous about going on an excersion with someone that we had met on the beach, but the experience was unforgettable and I would recommend him to anyone.

People ask me if I plan on trying somewhere new and one day maybe, but for the immediate future Huatulco is a keeper.  The weather is guaranteed hot, hot, hot.  The food is always great, but the people and the experiences of the area are what draws me back.  Snorkeling in beautiful bays is always an amazing experience, it becomes an addiction and the fishing and experience of boating on the ocean with friends and skilled fishermen is always a highlight of my trip.  I have been deep sea fishing for three years with Crisanto and his assistant Enrique and have never been disappointed.  His boat is the Blue Marlin and is top notch, it is very clean, well maintained and safe.  When the waters gets rough it is never a challenge for this captain to handle.  This year I fished twice and caught Mahi Mahi and Bonita, but the sailfish was too elusive.  We were on our way back to the marina from a day of fishing and snorkeling at Cacaluta Bay when they spotted the sailfish near the surface.  I have never seen two more determined fishermen as they tried to lure the fish to the hook.  We circled many times in an effort for the catch.  It was an amazing experience even though we came out without the big one.  I always have the pleasure to see turtles, sting rays and other sea life to add to the adventures of the great pacific ocean, plus the amazing view of the beautiful Sierra Madre.  Thank you again to the many amazing friends I have made in the area for a wonderful vacation memory.

Over the last fifteen years, we\\'ve vacationed in many of Mexico\\'s prime destinations.  Huatulco has a magnificent rugged coastline with 9 beautiful bays that are sprinkled with 36 pristine beaches.  Some of the bays/beaches are only accessible by boat.  We visited many of the bays and beaches on foot, by boat and by car.  \\nWe highly recommend Huatulco for travelers who are looking for natural beauty, great beach experiences, water sports, snorkeling, fishing, and friendly locals in a very laid back, authentic Mexican community.  Whether you are a first time or experienced traveler to Mexico a few other things may be on your mind as you plan your trip, namely safety and aggressive vendors (famous in Cancun and Cabo). \\n\\nSafety - as with any international travel you always have to be aware of what is happening around you and take necessary precautions.  Beyond that, we felt completely safe in Huatulco.  There is a Naval Base in the area, so there is a regular presence of military and police personnel.  People are friendly and respectful of your personal space.  We spent a lot of time in La Crucecita and Santa Cruz (morning, noon and night) and we did not encounter any threatening person or situation for the entire 2 weeks we were there. \\n\\nNo Hassle  - one of our least favorite aspects of Mexico travel is the persistent, sometimes overly aggressive vendors at airports, cruise ports, markets and beaches.  Huatulco was a welcome relief from that. Most of the vendors we encountered accepted \\u201cNo Gracias\\u201d and moved on.  Exceptions were at the restaurants at Playa Entrega and Playa Santa Cruz.  The best bet is to pick one quick and tell the rest no, because essentially all of the restaurants are the same.   Another strategy that worked great for us was to pre-arrange tours and a driver.    Prior to our vacation we were referred to an excellent tour guide/driver who speaks English well, drives an air-conditioned recent model year SUV and has strong knowledge of the area.  Armando does not work for a timeshare or other behind the scenes company.  He was primarily interested in ensuring we were comfortable and had a good time in Huatulco.   He is very flexible and adept at tour planning WITHOUT the hassle.   We had good times with Armando as he helped us with a Seven Bay Tour (awesome day with Captain Isidro on the boat Paty), a day at Barro de la Cruz (also great), airport transportation, and even our first trip to the grocery store (Super Che).  Armando is very reasonably priced and we highly recommend him.

After being flight delayed from Calgary and arriving 12 hours late- once we were in our room we forgot all that and realized all the positives we read about Huatulco were true.....and  then some !!\\nAfter reading about some of the food reviews we were a bit apprehensive but we enjoyed all we tried thoroughly and there was always something good ! we only tried the Seaside Grill and the Seafood a-la-cartes otherwise it was buffet or room service.That was a great bonus (free room Service) if you had an extended late afternoon &quot;siesta&quot; and didnt feel like getting fancied up for dinner.....order in....Great !! On Sunday we had the highlight of our trip when we went fishing with a very nice gentleman who had approached us on the beach at Dreams.....Jorge (pronounced Horhay) Valdovinos . He picked us up promptly at the agreed time on Sunday morning and a short drive later we were at his boat COCO and on our way ! Very nice,clean 33 Ft. boat with canopy for shade if you wanted.We were gone less then an hour when we were seeing turtles,pristine beaches not accessable by car, and catching fish ! We also saw a huge Blue Whale,natural faces in rock cliffs, a blow hole on Shore etc. !! Before we returned to Dreams Resort 4 hours after we left, my wife and I had caught 17 MahiMahi and 2 Bonita Tuna !! And seen things we will never forget and the friendly,professional captain and fish finding abilities of Jorge made for an unforgetable experience !! We talked to other people who had gone on other boats with only 4 fish so i think he is a skilled fish finder...lol...another day we made an excursion to LaCrucicita which was also very fun and only a 30 peso taxi ride each way...also the restaurant across the street from Dreams found the NHL play-off games for us !! Awesome!!Beautiful resort,great people,food ,weather and beaches !!! Can\\'t wait to go back next year or maybe this fall !! Highly recommended !!

Rudy is such a soft spoken kind guy I would recommend him to anyone with or without water or fishing experience ...

The hotel reps advise against this type of booking cause you have no protection if anything happens out there and also because they want the tourist money for themselves ... but hey we all have to make a living right ... and Im not saying that all these guys on the beach are like Rudy ... but I can asure Rudy is the real deal ... and when asking for him your suppose to say your looking for RUDY WITH THE STRIP ... he has a patch of hair from the bottom of his chin up to his lip and they call that a strip .... anyway we stayed at the Barcelo Hotel which I would also recommend ... Book your next Huatulco fishing trip with Rudy with the Strip and don\\'t be alarmed by his small boat like I was ... the boat is safe and it\\'s not the boat that will help get your catch of the day it\\'s Rudy\\'s knowledge of the water and the fish ....

Having done all of the popular tours over the years we were looking for something differant to do this year. We have always stayed at the Gala resort which is now the &quot;Dreams&quot; resort. We have always booked our trip through Apple Vacations which is the U.S. tour operator similar to Canada\\'s Signature Vacations. Both of these operators have desks at the hotels on Tangalunga Bay. They both strongly recommend booking any day tours through them. They both stress the safety and rip-off issue. Through the years our tours have been booked through Apple. Although the tours were interesting we felt that the price was higher than necessary and that the tours were always crowded. We have also had issues when tipping was asked for. This year we wanted to see the &quot;real&quot; Mexico. We wanted to take a day trip to see the small villages, ports and the people along with any other points of interest. We decided to do this on our own after several people had said that there were a number of English speaking cab drivers willing to do this. Our problem was that we were doing this with another couple and those cabs are small! I continued to talk with people around the resort and really wasn\\'t comfortable with the cab idea. Finally I met Luis Coca who ran a small concierge service in the plaza across the street from Dreams and the Barcello. After talking with him for 10 minutes in some detail he had planned a trip for us in a comfortable Chevy Suburban. I might add that Luis\\'s English was flawless and he was easy to speak to. Iwas still a bit uneasy however. I &quot;checked him out with the concierge service at Dreams and found Luis to be highly recommended! He actually had been the manager there for the concierge service before he decided to go out on his own. That was enough for us and we booked the trip for $150.00 for the whole day. We met Arturo Martinez our driver at 9am sharp the next day. He then proceded to show us the sites. We visited a crocadile farm, turtle research center, some pristine beaches and several small villages among other things. We didn\\'t get back until 6 that evening. Arturo also speaks very good English and is very intelligent and extreamly personable. He was able to answer all of our questions as well as giving us vast knowlege of the area. He never left our side and was willing to do anything that we ask of him. If you are looking to do something differant and with a fare price I highly recommend talking with Luis Coca (tel. [--]) or visiting him across the street from Dreams. I also recommend that you ask for Arturo (tel. [--]) In addition to the tour that we took there are many others and Luis is certainly willing to customize a trip that fits your needs!

The marina is where the 5- and 7-bay excursions depart from, and there\\'s a lot to see and do just walking around the 4-block radius--including the cruise ship port, the beach with several beach-side restaurants, a lovely chapel, and a park with a gazebo and lots of live music in the evenings. I suppose in some respects Santa Cruz Bay is pretty touristy because of the cruise ship port, but in reality, there\\'s only one ship in port weekly (Holland America), so it\\'s not really &quot;overrun&quot; by tourists as some reviews make it out ot be. At this point, the ship is in every Tuesday, and I thought it was fun to see the ship in port and experience the vibe of the area when it was buzzing with cruise ship day trippers as well as when they were gone and things quieted down. There are several good restaurants either on the beach or around the plaza for dining al fresco, and the overall ambiance of the area makes for some nice strolls.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Santa Cruz Bay", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/57/1c/c8/santa-cruz.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "648989615": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Santa Cruz Bay, Huatulco", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d152276-Reviews-Santa_Cruz_Bay-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/57/1c/c8/santa-cruz.jpg", "datePublished": "January 29, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Santa Cruz Bay is just one of the many bays in the Huatulco area.

Just watching the sights. Lots of families, couples and groups of all sizes. Playing on the beach or at the restaurants. Musicians of varying types wandering around. Mariachi, drummers, buskers. Lots to look at. Then it seems I found the guys. I started watching this young man shuck oysters. I have always loved them back home in Canada and listening to folks say they were always concerned with freshness at the beach. Well Antonio was still wet from when he was diving for them. So I ordered a dozen and while he was shucking away, met Isreal, a waiter of a restaurant very close. A Mazing! Had so much fun I brought a friend the next day. Before the food went and had a paddle board lesson and got pretty toasty and then time for some pints and a snack. We did one round of oysters and then had the scallops. Next level! Oooo the red sauce... Best time at the beach ever. This was a nice change from the regular sit down at the restaurants.

On both trips my brother in law and I fished with a young man named Hector. Hector is a very personable young man that\\'s just getting started in the fishing charter business. but do not let his rookie status scare you away......having grown up in the area and on the water, Hector knows his fish and how to find them!!  On both charters with him he put us on fish and we did well.   He recently bought a very nice used center console boat ( 18-20 ft) with a 115 hp Yamaha and electronics (radio, fish finder, etc). His tackle could stand to be upgraded but it is serviceable. His English is not very good but we managed to communicate just fine. And his prices are probably half of what everyone else in the area charges. \\nBeing a newcomer to the business, he doesn\\'t have a name for his business yet, or a website. To find Hector, go to the marina in Santa Cruz and ask around for Hector. His boat is named &quot;She\\'ll B Rite&quot;. His phone number is 958-106-3929. \\nSo if your in the area and want a good day fishing at a very reasonable price, check out Hector.

One of the highlights of my visit to this town was the discovery of a recently completed walkway between Santa Cruz and La Crucecita. The wide , clean, cemented and beautifully landscaped walkway(about 1/2 mile long) between these towns makes for a great diversion from the commercial enterprises of the area. La Crucecita, the town on the inland side of the walkway, is larger with a more local population. The town is extremely clean and also has a very safe feel. There are lots of restaurants, bars and shops as well as a couple of loom shops where the goods sold are made onsite. The town boasts a beautiful church on the edge of the well kept and active town square. If you are in the area this walk is a must do, if you can. The walk is set up so that one day it will be lined with commercial ventures but right now it is just a gorgeous path between the 2 towns.

It is fairly small and has way too many food vendors, actually restaurants with tables and shade that extend way out on the beach. No loungers for rental, so you have to sit at a restaurant and at least buy a few beers to sit in shade and have a chair. I don\\'t know why they set up so many tables, 3/4 empty and not have enough smarts to rent out loungers with umbrella\\'s - would probably bring in more tourists and money for drinks and snacks in that we would stay longer. Santa Cruz beach seems is about like Engraga beach, maybe snorkeling bit better there though. Nice clean water, calm, and safe area. Lots of locals on holidays / week ends. Restaurant waiters do get a bit annoying trying to get you to sit at their place. Trouble is if you let them, they sit you and you maybe want another table or area which is not their place. So just walk along the beach and ignore them until you see the table / area you like before committing to their pitch. Ugh.

The reviews about him and his beach restaurant are accurate; very kind man who ensured we had good beach loungers , umbrella , table and drinks and food throughout the day.  We enjoyed the breaded fried shrimp and French fries!  He brought our bill at the end of the afternoon along with shots of liqueur to thanks us. Nice!\\n\\n- water was a bit rougher here than Santa Cruz but fun none the less.  Enjoyed body surfing the big waves. Do swim out a bit from shore about 3-4 metres to avoid the rougher churn as waves crash into shore. \\n\\n- lots of options for food - there are at least 8 restaurants on the beach\\n\\n- good vendors on the beach. I bought a nice crocheted purse- fully lined, with good zipper for about $12. \\n\\n- super easy return, there are cabs lined up waiting to take tourists back to hotels. \\n\\n- met a little dog who came and sat in the shade by mylounger. He enjoyed a long drink of water, some potato chips and was content to just lay beside my chair and enjoy my company. I\\u2019m a dog lover who was really missing my dog so this was a nice unexpected part of the beach day!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- there is a very strong smell of garbage when you arrive in the parking lot. It was quite overwhelming and almost made us want to turn around and leave!  I realize it\\u2019s hot but one would think they might find a way to minimize this. \\n\\n- the complaints about the stairs (3 flights) to walk down to the beach are valid.  Going down was not so bad but coming back up at the end of the day when you are hot and tired was not so fun.  Beside the stairs there is a ramp but t honestly, if one were having mobility issues, I think this beach would likely be challenging. Perhaps there is another way down but I didn\\u2019t see any. \\n\\n- the surf was a bit rough. And the undertow could be strong at times. While this is a beautiful beach, if I had young children, I would likely take them somewhere calmer - like the beach at Santa Cruz.

The restaurants are steps closer to the sea although many steps from the parking lot. There are about 15 restaurants and I suppose they all offer similar things at similar prices.

Beer was 30 Pesos and breaded fish filet 150. That compared to 17 Peso beers and 100 Peso fish at the wilder Boca Vieja. There is a price for location. This is a fine sand, calm water south facing bay. There are private beaches without any development on either side but they require a hike or a boat. Thinking of boats, they start arriving around 1pm and the entire beach changes from sleepy to active. The boatloads fill selected restaurants for a couple of hours and then all is quiet again. Some restaurants take credit cards and at least one has WiFi.\\n\\nThis might be my favourite easily accessible beach to park myself in a restaurant chair or lounge for a calm water swim day. Why? San Agustin and Boca Vieja are too far for regular visits and the more compact La Entrega can be very crowded. I suppose Maguey crowds up on weekends too.

We liked it best as its very swimmable, clean, not over crowded, soft sand and beautiful.  We take a taxi there for 66 pesos one way, and full taxi stand awaits you at the end of the day.  There is 3 flights of nice concrete stairs to the beach (easy to walk).  The waiters wait at the top as taxis approach to entice you to there spot.  You can tell them you aren\\'t eating and they leave you alone, or go to El COSTENOS and ask for NINO he is great. At ANY resto on the beach you will find tons of fish, shrimp, octopus but limited choices on other stuff.  So pack a snack if you have a picky eater.  When you dine and drink at the restos on the beach the table is yours for as long as you want it and many set up free sun beds for you.  When at Maguey and looking at the beach I suggest you go for the restos on the right as later in the day (depending on tide) the restos on the far left get washed out by the tide around 3;30pm.  The vendors on the beach aren\\'t too plentiful and very friendly.  I strongly recommend you try some of the beach vendor foods: peanuts, flan and cheese cake, fried plantans with condensed sweet milk, etc... all safe to eat, delicious and cheap.  The funny part is the Mexican restaurants are Ok with you purchasing and consuming those foods as they don\\'t sell them. You can get floaties and snorkel equipment at the far end of the beach to buy or rent, and a massage shack near Costenos (they also have outside showers for 7 pesos).

Twice we went to Bahia de Maguey (Maguey Bay), once by private boat, you can read about that here, and once the four of us took a taxi there.\\n\\nWade and I were very excited to show Michele and Phil Maguey Bay as we had been there last year and it was the highlight of our trip.  You must read my review of Maguey Bay from last year, it\\u2019s amazing what a difference a year can make.\\n\\nOne of the things we had told Michele and Phil was how beautiful and calm this beach was, how many amazing fish there were to see and how great the little restaurants were.  I was so excited for them to see this place and for us to all be spending the day there.  So I can tell you I was shocked as I walked through the restaurants to the beach to find that the waves were 10-12 feet high and thundering onto the beach.  The once flat sand was now steeply curved down into the water, causing churning and undertow as the waves hit the beach.\\n\\nAt first I was very disappointed.  I had come here to spend the day swimming and these waves looked intimidating.  We took a few moments to walk along the beach and choose the restaurant spot where we would spend the day.  It\\u2019s really important if you come to Maguey Bay to come early enough to get one of the front beach spots at the restaurants, then you will not only have a table and dining chairs, but you will be lucky enough to get beach lounging chairs as well.\\n\\nToday we chose El Zarape Restaurante to make our home for the next four and a half hours.  We sat, ordered a few beer and contemplated the ocean.  I could tell already that we would not be able to see any of the beautiful fish I had seen before with these large waves, and I was hoping the waves would eventually cease so I could swim.  Don\\u2019t get me wrong, I love wave swimming, and did a lot of it on Big Beach in Maui, however these waves looked mighty intimidating.\\n\\nThen Wade and Phil decided to take a chance and go in.  Michele and I watched them anxiously and within no time they were past the break of the waves having a great time.  Once we saw that we knew we had to give it a try, so after I had been fortified from my first beer of the day I decided to brave the waves.  I walked down the steep beach, into the ocean, waited for a wave to break and then on the next one, dove right through it and viola, I was behind the break of the waves and the water was wonderful.  Very warm, very clean, and salty enough for us to be very buoyant.\\n\\nSuddenly, the day took on an entirely new direction.  We had come here to enjoy some relaxing swimming and snorkelling, now we were wave jumping and getting a fantastic workout swimming in the huge waves.  At one point we did walk to the far end of the beach where the fish are normally prolific however the visibility was bad and there was nothing to be seen.  It\\u2019s strange how much the ocean can change, from an idyllic snorkelling spot last year, the beach became a wave riders paradise this year.\\n\\nFor the full review please go to: http://beachesandbubbles.com/i-just-love-beaches-a-second-look-at-maguey-bay/\\n\\nTo read last year\\'s review of Maguey Bay you can click here: http://beachesandbubbles.com/maguey-bay-huatulco-mexico-beach-rating-5-05-0/", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Maguey Bay", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/57/1c/86/playa-maguey.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "193541651": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Fun place to Swim if you like playing in the waves!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d152277-Reviews-Maguey_Bay-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/57/1c/86/playa-maguey.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We had a blast playing in the waves here.

We went during the week on one of the days which was not very busy the other day we went was Sunday which was a lot more busy.

You\\'ll see surfers and boogie-boarders right in front of the restaurants.   The beach is at the bottom of bluffs that are topped by jungle containing a huge variety of birds, reptiles and butterflies, AND the Copalita ruins.   The ruins (see other reviews of this place) date back to 500 BC.   The beach stretches to your left (east) about a mile..   a short distance down the beach is where the Copalita river dumps into the ocean.   Its a good place to fish for Robalo (snook).   The river\\'s estuary is beautiful and always filled with a large variety of birds.  One of the reasons I love this beach is that its always changing.   I\\'ve been coming here for 26 years and its never the same.   Occasionally all of the sand is gone!   The location of the river mouth differs year to year.

The beach at La Bocana is truly one of the most beautiful in the world, bar none!  The money spent, a mere $10 US goes directly to the women\\'s co-op, with the tip, if you wish, to the service provider. What a wonderful opportunity to have the real deal authentic experience knowing the small amount you have paid goes directly to the service provider, rather than a large conglomerate, while the staff live in basic poverty.  There truly is something in the mud that not only softens your skin but helps increases circulation throughout your body.  I opted for the traditional method of rinsing in the river (actually the overflow from the ocean) which proved to be crystal clear calm waters.  The service is available to men and women and is the choice of the locals in the know!  Go before noon to avoid the mid-day sun (and hot sand) and be sure to bring your towel.  Spring for a light lunch at one of the outdoor cafes lining the beach (delicious and safe) and of course the liquid refreshment of your choice!  After all is said and done, the shopping and restaurants seem to blend into each other, but the mud wrap at La Bocana Beach will remain in your memory as an authentic non-commercialized Mexican experience.

So, I\\'m posting some pictures of the beach before and after the storm for anyone who\\'s interested, The beach has increased in size tremendously...it used to be a short walk from the ocean to the road. The wall that separates the beach from the road is badly damaged and there is a small lake between the wall and the ocean. Trees washed down the river and now are strewn on the beach. Vultures and other water fowl have taken up residence on the trees. The beach looks very different, but the ladies who do the Zapotecas mud baths are still there. That\\'s always one of the high points of my Huatulco vacation. Surfers are still on the beach.

We visited the Ruins and then walked back to La Bocana, which involves climbing a significant hill, but it is all downhill after that right to the beach. In total less than 1 km from the Ruins entrance. There are a few small businesses there, including two bars where you can get a cerveza (25 pesos), and a small hotel.\\n\\nIt is known for boogie boarding and the black sand which is probably of volcanic origin. However in May 2013 the area was hit by Hurricane Barbara, and as a result has changed significantly. I do not know if this has changed the conditions for boogie boarding, but the day we were there, December 13, 2013, there were a few trying it, but not many actually getting a good ride. I believe you can rent boogie boards and there is a place offering showers for 10 pesos.\\n\\nBased on older pictures the beach was close to the shore and much of it was very dark to black sand. Now, however, the sand is the normal yellow to slightly orange sand you find in the Huatulco area, but finer. And, there is a huge sandbar with a lagoon behind it, which extends back to the shoreline. The sandbar goes all the way East to the mouth of the Copalita river. In a photo I will include, titled Copalita Delta, you can see the end of the sandbar and a man standing in the middle of it (if you look real close!). There is a trace here than there of the black sand but nothing significant. If you have the time it would be well worth your time to walk from La Bocana to the Copalita delta. It is about 1 km on nice flat relatively hard sand, which is good for walking. There are lots of birds at the delta. Very scenic area, so don\\'t forget your camera!\\n\\nIt is also reported that local women offer mud baths at about 100 pesos each, but there was no evidence of them the day we were there. Apparently if you ask at the bar they will be there...\\n\\nThis is a recommended and well worthwhile stop if you are in the area. It is less than 3 km from Secrets and walkable down the main road if you don\\'t mind the hills and the heat. Probably about 50 peso taxi ride from the main Tangolunda resort strip.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa La Bocana", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/34/a6/fa/la-bocana-view-from-copalita.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "3 km past Secrets Resort", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Tangolunda_Bay-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico": {"672167695": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "amazing beaches. breeze is just the right amount.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d152569-Reviews-Tangolunda_Bay-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/32/f3/34/tangolunda.jpg", "datePublished": "May 7, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We were there for march break with our extended family and children and we all loved it.

Sounded good - I had the details.  Let me set this straight: there are TWO trails; one is a sandy offroad vehicle track, and the other is a shaded, jungle path, with birdwatching platform and a couple interpretive signs - the jungle path is about half the distance than the ATV trail. The ATV trail starts at the oft-described gate with guard that closes at 6 pm, at the end of a street opposite the turnoff to Maguey Beach.  The jungle path starts about a block before the gate, on the same street, at a sign, right off the street - no gate,  There is a sign when you come out onto the beach, and I had noted to myself that the way back was at the sign.  Due to the small sand dunes, the brush, etc. I couldn\\'t find that sign.  Someone told me the way they had come, which was the ATV trail way, and just took that one back.  One Plus along the ATV trail is a rancho that had a sign offering refreshments and snacks.  Probably a welcome cultural interaction if you desire.  Otherwise, I would definitely choose the shorter, shaded, quiet, jungle path.\\nSecond, the beach has a steep dropoff to its shoreline, and once in the water, the water gets deep fast. Trying to traverse the steep angled slope in the sand that your feet sink into was tiring and slow to navigate.  I tried to snorkel on the south side near the rocks, but even the small waves were too strong, and rocks are sharp.  I had read of an &quot;eatery&quot; on the beach, but there was nothing - a few stick shelters that offer a little shade.  A vagrant approached me wanting money, food and drink and wouldn\\'t leave until I showed him in my pack that I only had enough water for the day (I actually had only about 7 oz. in a 12 oz bottle), and told him only enough money for the taxi.  I didn\\'t feel safe leaving my pack on the beach after that, and since the water is actually too rough to get in the water, I left and went to Maguey beach and had a nice time.  \\nOne interesting thing I saw at Cacaluta was an obvious turtle track either to or from a nesting site higher on the beach.  There are also holes dug in the sand with sticks in them, probably denoting the (former) location of turtle eggs.  I dearly hope they\\'re from turtle conservation people and not turtle egg poachers.  Glad I did this little jaunt - the walk through the forest was the best part.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cacaluta", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/60/b7/8c/cacaluta-bay-2.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "northwest downtown Sta.

Many of the small boat operators can drop you off &amp; then pick you up from the beach at a set time.

Ensure that this bay is part of your travels, you will enjoy its seclusion &amp; privacy. Don\\u2019t forget to pack beverages &amp; food as there is nothing there, but an absolute paradise to be enjoyed. Don\\u2019t forget to sign a petition to save the National Park &amp; beach as there are plans to destroy its ecosystem for a golf course. Huatulco already has one which hardly ever gets used.

Our tour guide Omar and driver Eduardo made the tour very enjoyable as they both were very knowledgeable and entertaining.  Upon our arrival we were served a delicious breakfast of fresh organic fruits and the best bananas I have ever tasted - this coming from someone who does not care for bananas!   We also had a cheese quesadilla served which also was very good along with fresh coffee and delicious juices.  After being sprayed down with organic bug spray we were off on our tour.  The flowers and plants are beautiful here and we absorbed a lot of information about where they came from around the world.  There are many different trees as well of different Mexican fruits which we had never heard of before and got to sample or smell a few different ones.  They are building a few little cabanas here which will be for rent soon as a retreat for yoga, etc \\nWe then were driven to a small waterfall which was nice to cool off in but be prepared and wear water shoes as the rocks were hard to walk on for some of us.  It was the perfect place to end our tour and just relax for a bit.  There are change rooms here to put on your bathing suit instead of wearing it all day.  \\nWe then were driven back for a lunch of either grilled fish or chicken with rice, black beans and tortillas.  Myself and my friend had the fish which we both found delicious - in fact I ate everything off my plate \\ud83d\\ude33 the others in our group had chicken and most said it was good but a couple of people had chicken which they found grizzly however so I guess it was the luck of the draw!  We then started our trek home and were asked if we wanted to do a quick stop at a mezcal place which was very interesting to see how they process it.  A gentlemen was sitting and hand painting bottles for the mezcal which was great to watch.  We then were able to try many different mezcal with the cream ones being my favourite.  There were also grasshoppers which you could sample if you\\u2019d like (once a long time ago was enough for me!).  You could then purchase anything there as well.  We were dropped off back at our hotel at approximately 4:30 so price wise it was an excellent tour to take considering it included transportation, informative tour guide and both breakfast and lunch!

After crossing the river we went up to where many fruit trees grow, and where the owner, Armando, is building cabins to accommodate overnight guests.  We sampled fruit from various trees - cacao, limon real, and almonds and picked a few grapefruit.  Then Omar drove us to the river where we swam and played in the waterfall.  Lunch was chicken (also choice of fish or vegetarian) cooked in banana leaves with beans, rice, tortillas and tostadas, salsa, cactus and more juice.  Delicious.  We were home by about 4 p.m.  \\nArmando was also at the plantation so we were able to visit with him and talk about his vision.

But at Hagia Sophia one picture does not do justice to this beautiful oasis.  Let\\u2019s start at the beginning: We booked our visit one day prior through reception at our hotel, although you can also book directly at the head office which is located in the Marina at Santa Cruz.  At 8:30 we were picked up by Armando in a very comfortable but dusty white truck!  Then we knew that the adventure begins. After a 45-minute ride through Santa Maria de Huatulco on a very dusty road we arrived. \\nUpon our arrival we were served with fruit juices and then a typical oaxacan breakfast: a quesadilla with the wonderful local cheese, tomatoes, onions and avocado along with coffee that had a hint of chocolate.  Everything was served in locally made pottery, another nice touch. Then on to our tour along the riverbank.   This is where you became enveloped in nature\\u2019s paradise.  The flora, the fauna \\u2013 it didn\\u2019t matter where you looked, one flower was more exotic than the next and they were all identified. There were also massive trees such as the fern tree, Ceiba and bamboo. As well, there were so many species of butterflies and our host could identify every one. After this sun-filtered walk along the river, we gradually climbed upward \\u2013 the view was phenomenal with the Huatulco mountains in the background.  Here were the orchards.  Chestnut trees, cinnamon, apple banana, avocado, mango, mangosteen, coffee, cashew. An absolutely stunning setting. I asked Armando if he had a plan on paper when he first started planting at Sophia, and he told me that he had a vision in his mind.  Armando bought this abandoned coffee plantation 14 years ago and began planting hjs \\u201cdream\\u201d 12 years ago.   Hagia  Sophia is a labour of love and it shows as it grows. \\nBack down the hill for a wonderful lunch \\u2013 roasted prickly pear cactus, chicken, black beans, rice, roasted chestnuts.  There is a vegetarian option if you wish. After a small respite, off to the Magdalena River with its waterfall for a swim.  Clean change rooms and a very innovative shower.  \\nWhat a fabulous day.

The drive is about an hour and our driver Moises was very knowledgeable on the area and destination plus spoke very good English.\\n\\nHS is best described as a nature reserve. The location is quite remote, you drive 2.5km down a dirt road once off the main road and arrive at a rustic setting where 2 ladies were preparing breakfast for us over a large wood fired stovetop. We were greeted by the owner Mr. Armando who told us that he created HS because the world is being destroyed and poisoned by development and he wanted to make something healthy and special. Everything is 100% organic. Breakfast was fresh fruit grown on the grounds, juices and handmade quesadilla\\u2019s. It was delicious and healthy. There are nice washrooms on the site and you sit outside at wood picnic tables.\\n\\nWe then headed off down the interpretive trail which is filled with more flowering plants than one can imagine. Moises explained it all and after an hour we reached the river where we took a nice break in hammocks and had refreshments. We then proceeded onto higher ground where all of the fruit trees are located. We sampled many of the fruit right off the tree and there are many types that you will have never heard of. We then walked back to the dining area and went in the van to the river/waterfall for a swim which was fantastic. The river is cool and about 7 feet deep in places so you do have to swim a bit. It\\u2019s possible to walk around on the rocks if you\\u2019re not a swimmer. The waterfall is small with a nice cave behind it that you can stand up in. Very refreshing! Armando joined us here for a swim.\\n\\nWe then headed back in the van for lunch which was fish or chicken, cactus, beans and rice. All fresh made and delicious. After lunch you pay Armando and can also buy some organic bug spray and other products they make on site. Then it was back to town with a stop at the church in Santa Cruz.

The last part of the trip was via a dirt road that ends at the \\u2018heart\\u2019 of Hagia Sofia.  We were graciously greeted with flavored water drinks and light fruit.  My favorite quickly became the hibiscus water. We learned about organic sustainable farming as applied to exotic fruits and flowers from Southeast Asia and Mexico as well as the cultivation of rare timber trees native to Mexico.   Their interpretive trail, called the \\u201cPath of Flowers\\u201d, is approximately 550 yards long and is home to a wide diversity of flora and fauna. After completing the \\u201cPath of Flowers\\u201d interpretive trail, we loaded up in the van and drove the short distance to the falls for a quick swim.  Our drive took us across the Magalana River and provided wonderful view of the Sierra Madres.  Once our van stopped we were faced with a short and rocky hike to the base of the falls.  They seemed small to me compared to those I am used to seeing in Oregon, but were impressive non the less.  About half of the group opted to jump into the waters created by the falls.  After spending about 15-20 minutes here we then hiked back to the van and drove back to the main pulse of Hagia Sofia for our pre-arranged lunch.  The traditional lunch included tortillas, chips and salsa, rice, pot beans and cactus, along with a choice of chicken, fish or vegetable stew.  I opted for the fish which proved to be a great choice.  We also had the opportunity to try locally grown and processed coffee.  All of the plates and cups were hand crafted from local area clay and are used exclusively throughout Hagia Sofia.  Everything at Hagia Sofia is \\u2018natural\\u2019, right down to the organic bug spray we used.  During lunch we met the owner of Hagia Sofia, Victor \\u201cArmando\\u201d Canavati Nader.

The dry forest was previously cut down and is now a conservation area with beautiful flowers, vines, trees planted along a creek and then a lot of fruit trees up in the hilly area. The guide/owner, Armando, is a wonderful man, dedicated to showing what can be grown in the areas with a little irrigation from the creek and nearby river. He has local ladies cook you a fabulous lunch and after hiking the trails and viewing the plants we got to swim with Armando in his piece of the river. It was beautiful fresh, clear water with a small waterfall that you can go behind (with help). There are changerooms and toilets. Everything is very clean and well taken care of. The people are hardworking and friendly. Paid about $50 each and well worth it. I suggest you also leave a donation for the project too. A must see !!!

We had a choice of chicken or tuna, which was served with nopales (yum), black beans, and rice.

Our first visit to this charming location, situated in the foothills behind Huatulco, about an hours drive from Tangolunda Bay, was a couple of years ago. At that time, we met Armando, the charming owner. He acquired this 130 hectare property, with a river running through it, some 10 years ago. The first two years were spent in clearing some of the land, planting trees to replace some of the original ones which had previously been cut and putting in irrigation lines for his intended paradise. For the past seven or eight years, with the aid of his staff, he has been planting hundreds of varieties of beautiful flowers and fruit trees, both indigenous and brought in from other tropical regions of the world, This is a labour of love for Armando and he does not look upon it as a business venture. Having worked in industry for 34 years, he decided it was time to give something back to nature. Apart from creating a beautiful, peaceful, ecological paradise with flowers, fruit trees, flowers, butterflies and birds he wants to help the poor farmers in the surrounding area to improve their lot in life by growing a variety of fruits for sale, instead of just growing maize for their own consumption.\\n\\nThere is a small waterfall on his property and it is a delight to swim in the river below the cataract. Armando encourages visitors to swim upstream and enter a small cave behind the waterfall. The first time we visited, it was in early spring and I had no difficulty in doing so. Our second visit was last November, when I swam strongly upstream but remained in the same spot. I found it impossible to swim against the current to enter the cave. On this occasion, in early January, with the force of the cascading water being somewhat less (and with the help of a rope tied above the rocks) I was able to achieve this objective together with my 11 year old grand-daughter and my son-in-law. My 9 year old grand-daughter made it to the base of the waterfall, but was too intimidated by the force of the water to try to enter the cave. My 6 year old grand-son and my daughter decided to swim in calmer waters lower down-stream.\\n\\nArmando provides a wonderful opportunity for visitors to visit this exceptional site for a full day at a very reasonable price which includes transport to and from the site, a guided tour as well as an excellent freshly cooked breakfast and lunch.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Hagia Sofia", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/17/d6/04/mariposas-posando.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Mitla 402, Local 7 Km2. 5 Entrada a Magdalena", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "70989", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "189789598": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "wonderfull day", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d1630405-Reviews-Hagia_Sofia-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/17/d6/04/mariposas-posando.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Hagia Sofia is a must see an hours ride into the mountains you are picked up and dropped off at your hotel.

It is an ecological park up in the mountains, about 45 minutes from the tourist area of Tangolunda Bay. We had a wonderful experience!!!!! Transportation to the park was excellent - we rode in an air condition van that was not over crowded. On the way to the park the driver was generous and took us to take pictures of the church and the town hall in Santa Maria Huatulco. The church was lovely!! When we arrived at Hagia Sofia we were served breakfast (An abundance of fresh fruit, fresh fruit juice, and corn tortillas). The kitchen is open air and you can watch breakfast being made. During breakfast we were introduced to Armando, the owner of Hagia Sofia. After eating we went on a tour of the tropical flowers section and the fruit sections of the park - Armando was our tour guide. The amount and types of plants, flowers and fruits we saw was amazing!!!!!! It was also neat talking to people from different parts of Mexico. Once the tour was complete, those who wanted to go to the river and waterfall got back into the van for the short (maybe 5 min) drive to the waterfall. This was my personal highlight of the trip! You enter the river in very shallow water and then swim a short distance to the falls. The waterfall is quite small but it is very powerful and gives a great back massage! There is also a small cave beside the waterfall which is neat. The water is fresh and cool and the rock formations around the waterfall are lovely. After swimming at the waterfall we headed back to the main area for a delicious lunch (Edible cactus, chicken, rice, black beans, corn tortillas, and again more fresh fruit and juice.) We got to socialize and relax until we informed the driver we ready to leave.\\n\\nAll in all this tour was wonderful!!! It was amazing to have the personal tour done by the owner of the park and learning about his dream to help future generations of Mexicans was very humbling. Also, Betty, who we booked with was extremely friendly and prompt in helping us book this tour. We learned about Hagia Sofia on the internet and it seemed you could not book this tour through the hotel. We corresponded with Betty a few times and she met us at our hotel so that we could pay for the tour. I have to add that the price for the tour was great - Approximately $37 US dollars. (Our only word of caution would be that you cannot bring your own bug spray on site - you must use the eco friendly bug spray that they provide. It didnt work that great and my sister and I ended up with loads of sand fly bites - soooooooooooo itchy!

We tried to book through Sunwing and another local tour operator to no avail. They indicated that you needed a large group to book through them, but that wasn\\'t our experience.  We used the reservation link on the website and after a couple of e-mails Betty from Hagia Sofia made all the arrangements for us.  Thanks so much to Betty. (Aside: It was 450 pesos for each of us.)\\n\\nTransportation:  Juan picked us and another couple up at our resort and took us the 45minute drive to Hagia Sofia.  Juan also gave us a brief driving tour of Santa Maria on our way.  Santa Maria is a wonderful old village that I recommend others check out if they get the opportunity.\\n\\nBreakfast:  We were greeted with some breakfast.  We had a quesidilla made over a wood fire with Oaxacan cheese, red onion and fresh avocado.  In addition there was fresh organic fruit and some fruit juices.  It was amazing.  \\n\\nWalking tour:  We went on a walking tour with Juan as our initial guide and then Armondo (the owner).  The flowers and fauna were amazing.  I\\'m not sure words or even photos can do the scene justice.  Make sure you bring your camera.\\n\\nWaterfall:  If you wanted you could change into a swimsuit (in the very nice change rooms right at the waterfall site) and take a refreshing swim in the river.  The small waterfall gave an excellent back massage.\\n\\nLunch:  Believe it or nor, after the tour we were then served lunch. There was rice, beans, grilled prickly pear cactus (nopales), and a vegetable chicken mix, served with fresh tortillas.  And again fresh fruit and juices.  Make sure you go hungry, the food is incredible.  \\n\\nWashroom facilities:  Modern (the M is for mujer or woman and the H is for hombre or man:  this may be obvious to everyone else but it was confusing for us).  \\n\\nArmondo told us that the goal of the site is to promote knowledge and  sustainability for the people of Oaxaca. \\n\\nWe have every intention of taking this tour again when we return to Huatulco so that we can see how Hagia Sofia has grown.  This isn\\'t your typical tour where you are on a strict proscribed timetable and someone is always trying to sell you something.

Our family of 4 (19 to 55 yrs) went April 13th.  What made our experience great though was Edgar Escobar, our guide, who I booked prior to leaving for Huatulco.  I found his name through another review and contacted him on his Facebook Page at Huatulco\\'s Edgar Escobar. Cell is 958-118-2465. His first language is English so communicating with him was exceptional and he is very accommodating.  Yes it is a lengthy drive but the whole time he taught us many things about the area and the horticulture and folklore and his fascinating life. We felt perfectly safe with him and would never have ventured into the cave without his guidance.  He knows exactly where to step and what to hang onto in order to be safe. He let us set our own pace with no time limits on anything. We spent a fair amount of time at the rope swing and had we gone with a larger tour we would have missed out on that enjoyment.    \\nEdgar also organized a boat for us to do the bay tour (April 17th) which was fabulous as we ended up seeing hundreds of dolphins in a rare show of spectacular jumping, two whales and a number of turtles. He actually let us use his pesos rather than our U.S. money in order to save us the exchange at the restaurant we stopped at on the beach during the bay tour. And because it was my husband\\'s birthday he and the boat driver arranged to have some Mexican singers surprise my husband at the beach. At this stop we were very glad to have him along again to explain some numerous things to us.

I purchased the dried flowers and coffee beans because I don\\'t know the next time I\\'ll be back.\\n\\nAlso, we went to the butterfly center where they had native butterflies (HUNDREDS of them) and a nursery where they were growing and hatching butterflies to help conservation.

The red flag was up all four times we visited--whether the waves were less or more than a foot high. I point this out to suggest that perhaps whether one goes in the water or not should depend on one\\'s comfort level upon seeing the waves. We went into the water on every visit and saw many other people in the water as well. We are also snorkelers, so we snorkeled as well. We found a variety of fish near the rocks on the west side of the bay as well as near the rocks just west of the lifeguard tower in front of Isla Huatulco Beach Club. The visibility wasn\\'t great (which is why I\\'m removing one star), but it was good enough to see some sea life. \\n\\nWe had read about the undertow, but we didn\\'t experience it during our visits. Having said that, I would recommend snorkeling in Playa Chahue only for those who know how to navigate waves and who know how to swim out of a possible undertow.

The beach is relatively long compared to others in the area, sheltered by rock faces on either side. An extreme drop off and strong undertow can make the waves a dangerous place to swim. We visited late in the afternoon and the red flag was raised on the beach to alert swimmers to dangerous conditions. This warning didn\\'t stop too many eager swimmers, but lifeguards manning the beach were diligent about ensuring those braving the waves stayed within the roped off area. My boyfriend and I stayed near shore to play in the surf and still got our fair share of of ocean spray. The beach at Chahue is wide and hilly, and walking through the hot &amp; deep sand was a workout! We took to a bali bed at one of the beach clubs to rest and seek shade. We chose lattitude 15 as the others were quite full. At 100 pesos per person for admission, I would venture to guess this was one of the more expensive beach clubs in chahue, but the beer was cold &amp; kept flowing and only set us back 35 pesos a glass.

The outdoor display signs are in English and Spanish (when legible). the signage at the museum is in Spanish. There are three small excavated structures, two temples and a ball court. The temples are of the `truncated pyramid` type and while interesting are just not on a par with the major Aztec and Mayan sites. There`s no climbing on the structures; visitors are kept well back. There`s a path through the forests to an uphill (mildly challenging) trail that takes you to an overlook of La Bocana beach and the mouth of the Copalita River where it meets the ocean.

You can see why these ruins were unknown for so long, as thick as the vegetation is.  To get to the view over the ocean there is a bit of a climb up well designed stairs. The Temple of the Mayor is huge, I never expected to see anything like it at the site.  All of the signs and descriptions are in Spanish &amp; English along the trail... Unfortunately they are only in Spanish in the museum.  The architect who designed the building and park won an award for it... I can see why!

First we joined him in Copalita Ecological Park and then hired him a second time to see the Huatulco National Park birds.  Both are just short drives from Huatulco itself.  Our guide\\'s name was Cornelio Ramos Gabriel.  This man has a genius for calling in some birds and/or hearing them then spotting them with his naked eye.  Before you know it , he says, &quot;I\\'ve got it!&quot; and that means he has the bird in his spotting scope for his tour members to step up and see fully magnified.  He twice  called in Pygmy owls for us.  He spotted a group of Boat Billed Herons, a Doulbeday\\'s Hummingbird, and dozens of tropical birds we NEVER would had seen had he not been with us like a an Social Flycatcher.  Once all have looked, if there is time, he will then take your camera and shoot pictures of the bird through his scope while he tells you about that bird and its habits .  He also spotted a porcupine sleeping up  high in a tree.  He speaks and understands English very well and is a pleasure to be with.  I highly recommend him.  He can be reached by email at birdguidecornel@gmail.com or birdguidecornelio@hotmail.com or by going to his website at http://www.coug.net/cornelio/\\n\\nAt Copilita you will find a mixture of marsh, dry land and estuary birds.  The view where the river meets the ocean is magnificent and there you will see many varieties of shore birds.  This park also has a small museum housing artifacts of the area and there are some ruins along the walking tour with Cornelio.

We took a taxi from Secrets to the park at a cost of 50 pesos and arrived about 9:00 AM. The park opens at 8:00 but there were not a lot of people there even at 9:00. We saw three other groups in our walk. Admission for non national adults was 80 pesos each.\\n\\nHaving toured the Mayan ruins at Tulum and Coba, we were interested in seeing the differences at this Zapotec site.  The first thing you notice is how new and upscale the reception and artifact display area is. The only unfortunate part is that almost all the exhibits are under glass and hard to photograph. No flash photography is allowed, but the hard part is avoiding reflections on the glass even without a flash. I included a couple of photos below that were reasonably clear. There are many more interesting exhibits. I understand they are from Oaxaca, but not necessarily from this particular Copalita site.\\n\\nThe structures themselves are no where near as sophisticated as those at Tulum, or as large as those at Coba. Construction was more similar to Coba with a lot of the material appearing to be round water washed rock from the nearby Copalita river. Like Coba there is a ball court similarly constructed but not nearly as elaborate. Almost all of the reasonably uncovered and restored structures are very close to the reception area. If you were not into taking a long walk or were in a wheelchair, I believe you could see most of it, without a huge effort. The paths like the reception area were very new and well made.\\n\\nWe did not take the long path to the marshlands which forks off to the North (left) just past the main central plaza structure. But, we did go to the end of the path which eventually takes you up some stairs and to a couple of excellent lookouts to see the Copalita river delta area, and also a picturesque view of La Bocana beach.  See photos. As a result of the tropical storm which hit this area in the last rainy season in 2013, the delta has been significantly altered, and there is now a huge sandbar which extends from the mouth of the river to La Bocana. You can get out onto this sandbar at La Bocana and walk right to the mouth of the river \\u2013 about 1 km. In the one photo you can see a person standing out on the sandbar. Near the top of this trail there were workers restoring the only other visible structure. It is believed to be the location where sacrifices were made. One marker stone remains intact and they are currently uncovering more of the original rock. See the photo. The significant marker is being used as shade for their lunch! Not much to see on the trail past the second lookout, and it just goes to a dead end in the jungle. If you are tired by this point don\\'t bother going further. \\n\\nWe did not see many birds, flowers, or wild life other than the pelicans and buzzard like birds which you find on the coast. From the Copalita entrance we walked the 1 km or so back down the highway and into La Bocana beach area. It is certainly worth a stop for a cerveza or two while enjoying the view. From there we took a taxi for another 50 pesos back to Secrets. The distance to Secrets is walkable, BUT, there are significant hills and it is HOT! The taxi ride was appreciated.\\n\\nHope that helps some. I would go early in the day, and make sure you take some insect repellent and a bottle of water. As it is a park with butterflies etc., they do not fog for mosquitoes and black flies. \\n\\nIt is a very worthwhile and modestly priced \\u00bd day excursion to make.

Entry was 100pesos. Cab from Santa Cruz was 75pesos. The small museum houses an amazing collection of artifacts in pristine condition. From what we could read and understand, I was under the impression a good portion of these were unearthed at Monte Alban/Mitla region near Oaxaca City. \\nThe park closes at 5pm, so we didn\\'t have a lot of time to linger, but we made the trek to the lookout over the Rio Copalita and Playa Bocanas. It was well worth it! Just take your time and bring water. According to people we spoke with at our hotel, the best time to go is when they first open at 8am, the birds are apparently something to see. Next time! We did see geckos galore, and butterflies everywhere. \\nThe ruins aren\\'t as spectacular as Tulum or Coba, etc, but due to the size, you do get a very close look at the architecture. Also, it\\'s a recent discovery- 1999...and only was opened to the public in 2012, so I\\'m sure they\\'ll find more as they keep digging. \\nAnother suggestion, bug repellent!

I expected the beautiful clear blue water, but I was surprised at the stone seashore.  The blue waves crashing into gray and black craggy wall, with white spray was for me jaw dropping.  Having lived in Hawaii and the South Pacific, I was accustomed to the sea slamming into large lava flows.  I believe I was looking at metamorphic rock vice volcanic.  I am not a geologist, but the stone was quite striking.  I was told I was looking at the southern extension of the St. Andreas Fault.   As we proceeded up the coast we saw isolated coves with white sands and no waves, each gorgeous.  We learned that we were not the explorers we thought we were.  These coves with their exquisite beaches had hosted movies, commercials, nature documentaries, and photo shoots.  There was no doubt why.  We went ashore for lunch before we turned back at a cove with two restaurants and bars (both without names) and all the amenities you would find on any beach on the Pacific side of Mexico.  I say this because you can see a paved road high beyond the beach, but there is no access from the road to the beach coves or beach to the road. Our boat was comfortable with ten passengers, all family.  There are what is known as &quot;seas&quot;.  There is some rough water, but  will always be able to see around the boat. The boat was safe and the captain took caution, with no risk.  If you have or think you have motion sickness, take Dramamine or ginger to be on the safe side before you get to the dock.

First we joined him in Copalita Ecological Park and then hired him a second time to see the Huatulco National Park birds.  Both are just short drives from Huatulco itself.  Our guide\\'s name was Cornelio Ramos Gabriel.  This man has a genius for calling in some birds and/or hearing them then spotting them with his naked eye.  Before you know it , he says, &quot;I\\'ve got it!&quot; and that means he has the bird in his spotting scope for his tour members to step up and see fully magnified.  He twice  called in Pygmy owls for us.  He spotted a pair of Gold Crowned  baby hummingbirds in the nest and dozens of tropical birds we never would had seen had he not been with us like a an Orange Breasted Bunting.  Once all have looked, if there is time, he will then take your camera and shoot pictures of the bird through his scope while he tells you about that bird and its habits .    He charges approximately $50 for a 3  hour very gentle walking tour that includes some fruit and water and transportation to and from your lodging.  He speaks and understands English very well and is a pleasure to be with.  I highly recommend him.  He can be reached by email at birdguidecornel@gmail.com or birdguidecornelio@hotmail.com or by going to his website at http://www.coug.net/cornelio/\\n\\nThe park itself  was in it\\'s dry season while we were there so did not have the feeling of the tropics, but the roadside to the entrance and the lagoon inside it to which we walked were teaming with bird life.  At the time we went the bridge that once could take all the way to the ocean was down so we were not able to complete that part of the walk.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Huatulco National Park", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/28/48/ea/huatulco-national-park.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "258374763": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "So happy this is preserved!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d4067241-Reviews-Huatulco_National_Park-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/28/48/ea/huatulco-national-park.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Beautiful shoreline and so happy that the Mexican government has protected this area.

I went down closer to the middle where you could see lots of coral formations out farther. There were lots of boats coming and going taking out snorkelers and divers.  I had to go out quite far to get to the coral but it was getting too deep and the water was stirred up from the waves so I did not get to see much unfortunately.  I could see some bigger fish but just too murky.  Disappointing but the beach was beautiful and we enjoyed swimming and playing for awhile before heading back to the resort.

Our guides took us out for over an hour (the tour was 3 hours and I didn\\'t wear a watch swimming, so it was hard to tell how much time we actually snorkeled but it was enough)   The guide would keep diving down deep stirring up the fish and sometimes brought up something unique to show us, like a sponge.  The colors of the fish in this area are breath taking.  We went to the cave which is not really an enclosed cave,  you swim thru a narrow gap and then it opens up so you are in an opening with real high walls, but you can see the sky.  I guess that is where the bats go in the evening.\\nWell after a GREAT snorkel, we went up the beach and there are restaurants, or tables to sit at and enjoy a meal and beer.  There are souvenir shops and people walking around trying to sell stuff.  \\nAfter a much needed rest we headed back to the pier.  The views while driving to and from the beach are AWESOME.

Endless beach bordering the Pacific Ocean.  To the south is the mouth of the Cobalita River, which at this point in the season barely makes it to the ocean.  There were several bird enthusiasts at this overlook one of whom pointed out an eagle perched on a log in the river and eating a fish it has just caught.

Through the years we often at at the small restaurants in Bocana Copalita not knowing that there was an archaeological site on the hillside above us.  This site has been developed into a wonderful facility with a small, modern museum.  The modern facilities are well laid out, attractive and new.  Very nice.  You then walk through tree covered trails, around ruins and through different habitats.  Various species of wildlife are all around.  At the end of the trail there are a series of steps up a hillside that rewards you with spectacular views along a walk on the edge of the cliff face.  All in all a wonderful way to spend some time in Huatulco when not on the beach!  One suggestion is that the museum displays should have English translations as well as the Spanish.

Guides offer additional context, information, and even point out sites and sounds that the casual uninformed visitor may (likely) miss.

The forest is alive with birds, butterflies and the occasional sighting of snakes and other fauna. The part-reconstructed Mixtec ruins (and more would be welcome) give enough information for the viewer to guess how impressive it must all have been some 800 years ago. Again, going early by taxi, before the bus tours arrive, is a magic moment where the mystery of the Mixtecs will fascinate.\\nIt needs a simple coffee shop (with local coffee and juices) to complete the complex and perhaps a notice board of the state of Oaxaca, pinpointing other archaeological areas that might be of interest to the traveller.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Bocana del Rio Copalita Archaeological Zone", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/d9/cc/de/ball-park-at-archaelogical.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Blvd. Benito Juarez, near Playa La Bocana and the Copalita River", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "122369719": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Very beautiful spot and interesting tour!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150789-d2092287-Reviews-Bocana_del_Rio_Copalita_Archaeological_Zone-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/d9/cc/de/ball-park-at-archaelogical.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Highly recommend!

It is just a short distance on Blvd. Benito Juarez past the entrance to the beach.  Admission is 50 pesos/person.  You can hire a guide if you wish for about 200 pesos (or that was the price quoted to us).  We chose to just do the tour ourself.  There are paved walkways, most of it is in the shade.  By most of the reconstructed ruins, there are plaques which will tell you what each building/site is (or I should say, was).  It appears that perhaps it is not finished, as there are some areas that were roped off.  You can keep walking uphill to the lookout over the ocean which, to me, was worth the visit for that alone.  I heard you need to go early as it gets very hot.  We were there around 10:00 am; you are not in the sun and heat unless you do the climb to the lookout.  If you are not in good shape or have health problems, it could be a little difficult.  The climb to the lookout is NOT shaded so make sure you have water.  But the view from the top was incredible.  \\n\\nThere is also a museum on site; we did not go inside.  It was our first day and we were anxious to get to the beach.  It took us about 1-1/2 hours to see the entire site on our own and we hustled.  I\\'m sure a guide would have more information on each attraction.  Bathrooms are only at the entrance, by the museum; there are none on the path.  There are also storage lockers for a very nominal price. if you don\\'t want to haul your stuff around.\\n\\nFrom there, we walked down the road, about 15 minutes or so, to Playa La Bocana where we spent the rest of the day.  You can take a cab, but it definitely was walkable.  This is not far from the hotel zone, and it is a very nice park, lots of birds.
