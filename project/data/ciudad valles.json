We had lunch at Don Lenchos Taqueria within the market.  So yummmmy!!! It has extremely limited seating but worth the wait and the cramped area.  We also saw some live dancers which was gorgeous to watch.  We then walked a couple of blocks to the plaza location which is indicated here.  There was music on the loud speaker, a mix of American and Mexican music.  We sat on the benches and enjoyed the scenery.  We then walked down to the riverside and enjoyed some quiet time there.  There is a lot to look at in terms of trinklets and fun food to enjoy.  We felt very safe.  Of course take precautions, as you would anywhere you travel.

We were staying at Hotel Aventura Huasteca and the guide from our rappelling tour recommend that we go and enjoy the temazcal at the resort that night.  For those of you that don\\u00b4t know what that is it\\u00b4s kinda like a mud-like igloo where they have sauna rocks inside with herbs and flowers in with the rocks.   But before you go in you cover yourself in mud, have a little spiritual ceremony (I am not religious but practice yoga, I find it similar to yoga meditation) and then you wash off the mud in the natural thermal spring.  \\n\\nIt was a pretty amazing experience if you like this type of thing.  Many of my friends have done temazcales but I had always been pretty unsure of them.  When you are in the igloo you give thanks to what you have, you apologize to the people and things you have hurt, you wish for anything and you ask forgiveness for your regrets all the while they add more rocks and make the hut hotter.  \\n\\nafter the ceremony they dowse you in cool water and lay you down and wrap you up in warm blackets and finish off at the end with a special tea with a spoon of honey.\\n\\nAll for only 150 pesos per peson!!  Which is about 12usd each.  \\n\\nI loved it and the grounds of the resort look really nice.. the natural pool does look a little scummy though but it\\u00b4s natural so what can you do.  We might consider staying there next time we go back though as they have rock climbing there.  \\n\\nTry to avoid weekends and national holidays to visit there.  We visited there during the Sept. 15th weekend and the place was packed.   The temazcal started at 7pm I think but arrive an hour early and they let you enjoy the pools.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cueva en Taninul", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/51/4b/83/the-standard-pool.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Valles", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Huaxteca_Hasta_el_Perro_se_Divierte-Ciudad_Valles_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast": {"676204584": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Rafting", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499409-d3804785-Reviews-Huaxteca_Hasta_el_Perro_se_Divierte-Ciudad_Valles_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/b4/42/a9/getlstd-property-photo.jpg", "datePublished": "May 24, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Very organized , professional, safe and what a fun crew \\r\\nWill recomend to all my friends back home!!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Huaxteca Hasta el Perro se Divierte", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/b4/42/a9/getlstd-property-photo.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Boulevard Mexico-Laredo #209", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Valles", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "79050", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "675957773": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "WOW!

It dropped us at a \\'look-out\\' a few kilometers past the town of Platanito. There is a zip lining company running from here if you\\'re into that. We had been told there were stairs down to the falls so after a few misdirections, we continued walking the way the same bus was driving for about a kilometer until we came to a hydroelectric building with a set of concrete stairs leading down. At the bottom, there is a primitive path leading to the top pool and largest set of falls and is also the access point for a place you can jump into the second pool. Continuing through the chain link gate and down, there are some rocks you can watch from and another jump. Most people had a guide with them to jump, those who didn\\'t also wore life jackets. We didn\\'t swim (was too cold!) but it seemed you had to wear the life jacket regardless. \\nComing down the stairs, there was no one charging entry. However, when you walk back to the \\'look-out\\', continue towards where the falls go under the road. On the non-river side there are a set of stairs going under the road and they take you all the way down to the toilets/snack bar/camping area which you pay 30 pesos for entry. \\nWe ended up walking back into Platanito and a colectivo taxi took us back to Centro Ciudad Valles for 25 pesos each but a local man said the Vencedor buses came back that way eventually. \\nPlease note we speak very very basic Spanish so all of this is relatively easy if you have the same or any more than we do!\\nThe falls were lovely and very quiet when we were there.

There are seven waterfalls, ranging from 6 feet (2 meters) up to 25 feet (8 meters) in height.  Between each waterfall there is a pool (poza), from 200 up to 400 feet in length, all are beautiful.   The setting is gorgeous, as the waterfalls sit on the bottom of a canyon, maybe 600/700 feet tall, full with vegetation.  \\n\\nWhile this spectacle would be enough, the fun part of the activity is to be able to jump from pool to pool from the waterfall\\u00b4s edge.     You need aqua-shoes or tennis shoes, as the rock is at times very slippery.   There are some strong currents, but nothing that can not be navigated by an ok swimmer.    If you want to take more precautions you can wear a helmet and/or a floating device.     If you travel with Huaxteca.com the guides are not only attentive, but very safety conscious.    The drawback is to have a large group of different ages/different athletic ability folks, that can drag the movement from waterfall to waterfall.\\n\\nIf you travel with your own group, Huaxteca.com offers &quot;private tours&quot;, say for 6-12-20 people, with guides and equipment and this would make the jumping so much more enjoyable and fast paced.    It takes, depending on the group, from 45 minutes to 90 minutes to complete the circuit.\\n\\nA great excursion would be to do the circuit twice, while having time to enjoy the scenery and the thrill from the higher jumps.    There are pools (pozas) where you can jump from other rocks into water depths over 15 feet, so there is no risk of hitting a rock at the bottom.\\n\\nThe water temperature in december was 26/27 degrees celsius, so a bit colder than a swimming pool, but nothing you can not get used to quickly, specially when the sun is out at 11 AM or later.\\n\\nIt is almost impossible to find the entry if you are by yourself the first time, but it is possible that after a &quot;guided&quot; excursion, you can return on your own (no restrictions or limitations, no lifeguards, no safety measures, you are at your own risk) and jump without equipment and have the time of your life.\\n\\nWorth going for sure!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cascada de Micos", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/69/b8/89/cascada-de-micos.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Valles", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "79233", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "328782890": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Stunning spot and loads of fun", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499409-d8599935-Reviews-Cascada_de_Micos-Ciudad_Valles_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/69/b8/89/cascada-de-micos.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I can\\'t recommend this place enough!

I read the reviews of a couple of companies on TA and went to both operators to find out what the tours included. Although the content of the tours are very similar I was impressed by the attitude of the staff in the office at MS Xpediciones. I speak some Spanish and although this is not essential it does help. One of the women in the office speaks good English and she told me that she is available to accompany non-Spanish speakers on tours if the guide does not speak English.\\n\\nI booked my first tour to cascada de Tamul, and after this booked two more tours with them to cascadas Minas Viejas on one day and Xilitla on the third day. All of the tours include a stop in the afternoon for a late lunch which include local dishes. For the trips to the waterfalls expect to get wet even if you don\\'t want to have a swim in the river. At the gardens of Edward James there are also a series of pools which you can swim in if there is time. The trips are fairly leisurely but you can expect to do a bit of paddling for the trip in the canoe to Tamul. I forgot to pack my swimming clothes and river shoes but these can be bought at the various waterfalls or the market in Ciudad Valles fairly cheaply.\\n\\nI kept going back to MS Xpediciones because of the friendliness of the guides and the good service. They were punctual for the pick up from the hotel in the mornings and had a slightly later start than some of the other companies. The make up of the groups is always hit and miss but I was lucky, or maybe it\\'s just Mexican bonhomie, and had a great time talking to the other members of the groups, learning about Mexican culture and other places to visit.

Huasteca is a region on the eastern part of the San Luis Potosi province. We drove east from San Luis Potosi via RioVerde to the Huasteca Potosina region. This is a beautifully natural area, with lots of trees, hills/mountains, natural springs, rivers, waterfalls and hiking/climbing. We drove on well paved roads most of the time, and traffic was very sane; no issues with driving. The places we visited that we recommend are \\n\\n- Cascades de Tamul; which is a waterfall that you have to paddle to from a small village called Morena, about 20-30 kms north of Aquisimon. Here, for between 400 (shared) and 600 pesos (alone); the guide will take you in his canoe (4km) paddling to the magnificent water falls. The water of the river is turquoise in color (from limestone and minerals in the water), and there are many natural waterfalls along the way. There are a lot of natural springs along the way, where water gushes out of the ground. Clean, clear and fresh water. \\n\\nThe waterfalls are worth the view, and you can jump/swim off a large boulder &quot;island&quot; near the foot of the falls. You cannot get close to the falls by river because of the rapids. ON the way back, there is a stop at a large cavern which is a natural swimming hole.. \\n\\n- Another good place we visited was the Sotano De las Golondrinas; or the cave of the swallows; and is on the outskirts of Aquisimon town. This is a huge cave 330m deep, and the top of the cave is open and about 50m wide. Very early morning (6:30-8:30AM), the swallows come out of the cave by the hundreds to forage for food for the day, returning in the evening. So you have to get here by 6:30AM, and be patient and quiet (swallows will not come out of they sense noise and hence danger threat). When the swallows come out, the fly our counterclockwise out of the cave slowly and then take off by the hundreds. Quite fascinating. \\n\\nYou get there by driving very early in the morning (about 20 mins from Aquisimon), pay the 30 peso entrance fees, and hike down 560 steps to the top of the cave. Be sure to take a flashlight with you as it is pitch dark at 6AM. \\n\\n- Xilitla is a noce picturesque town built on steep hillsides; similar to swiss towns.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Huasteca Potosina", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/36/6a/4a/huasteca-potosina.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Valles", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "78395", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "344609755": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Incredible place to explore and discover yourself!!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499409-d3228730-Reviews-Huasteca_Potosina-Ciudad_Valles_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/36/6a/4a/huasteca-potosina.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is in the top 5 places I have been in Mexico and is almost endless for exploring and discovering new places.

As such, here are my recommendations for touring the region:\\n\\nThe &quot;Huasteca&quot; stretches roughly between the  city of San Luis Potos\\u00ed (NW), to just north of Ciudad Valles (NE), to below the town of Xilitla (SE), and the arroyos (SW), and everything in between. Most sites lie 1-3 hours away from each other or the nearest town. To travel from one end to another takes roughly 7 hours. For this reason, I\\'d recommend you plan on spending at least a week in this region, if possible. Everything is worth seeing, and there\\'s so much to see. It\\'s basically a lush area with lots of hiking, waterfalls, and caves. Lots of adventure can be had during the right season (Jan through early June) and for the right price ($40 - $200 US), such as waterfall jumping and repelling, canoeing, kayaking, bathing in hot springs, swimming in clear, blue rivers and caves, touring caverns, ziplining, touring missions, convents,  villages, and archaeological sites, etc... Simple entry into any park or attraction is cheap, roughly 20 to 80 pesos ($1 - $5 U.S.). \\nPre-planned tours can be purchased including food, travel, lodging, and adventure tours for those with limited schedules who prefer a brief introduction to the area without the hassle of arranging anything. Of course, the convenience of these tours means you\\'ll pay prices inflated 3 - 10 times what you\\'d pay on your own.\\n I always strongly recommend arranging everything yourself and using public transportation or a rented car to enjoy the luxury of arriving early to avoid the crowds (priceless), and the freedom of dictating your own schedule once there (equally valuable). That said, public buses run to every town in the area and almost every site. As a single, blonde, female traveler, I had zero problems with safety in the region - not to imply that I don\\'t need to be familiar with the area ahead of time (I study up), wary of my surroundings at all times, as inconspicuous as possible (for a white girl), or speak Spanish (my accent passes). I employ all of those skills when traveling, as should you. That said, I can often access areas that may prove tricky for travelers who do not speak any Spanish or are bogged down by pack mules loaded with touristy &quot;stuff&quot; or a pesky passel of kids. \\nNevertheless, here\\'s a quick overview of the most popular tourist sites:\\n\\n1. Edward James Surreal Gardens (castle, waterfall, and pools), located 15 min outside of the town of Xilitla.\\n\\n2. Parrot Cave-  Near Xilitla (5 min drive), past the Pemex station, is a huge cave that is visited at sunset by green parakeets (not to be confused with The Huge Cave, El S\\u00f3tano, near Aquism\\u00f3n). After a few hundred meters, the road curves left, turn right and park in the small lot. Then walk downhill about 8 minutes to the entrance. \\n\\n3. S\\u00f3tano de Las Gol\\u00f3ndrinas - This is a massive cave opening - 62 meters, at its widest points, and 372 meters deep. At dawn and dusk each day, large flocks of golondrinas (swallows) leave and return to their nests in the s\\u00f3tano.  By bus, Aquism\\u00f3n is about 1 hr north of Xilitla and 2 hrs south of Ciudad Valles. From Aquism\\u00f3n, buses are rare heading the 8km up to the cave opening. I found a ride half way, but had to walk uphill a few miles for a couple hours to get there.  Entrance fee and hike down to the site are minimal. Go during high tourist season (Feb to May) to rappel or descend (via spiral staircase) into the cave and walk on the massive floor below. \\n \\n4. El Nacimiento - &quot;the birth&quot; - one of the main rivers that runs throughout the Huasteca. These rivers are all fresh, cold, bright aqua blue, and perfect for swimming in the hot, humid jungle. This one is located 30 minutes north of Xilitla in a tiny pueblo called Huichihuay\\u00e1n. Follow the signs. \\n\\n5. Tambaque River - Tambaque is another nacimiento swimming area located on the Tanute River. It\\'s about an hour north of Xilitla, just past the town of Aquism\\u00f3n. Just before the bridge (over the river), is a stone path that leads to the source, where the water cascades into a series of small pools.\\n\\n6. Missions - visit any of the first five missions established by Friar Jun\\u00edpero Serra - who later founded the California missions - south of Rio Verde, along the road to Jalpan, and Quer\\u00e9taro. \\n\\n7. Waterfalls- various waterfalls can be found near the towns of Rio Verde, Tamasopo, Ciudad Valles, and Xilitla.\\n- The Tamasopo Falls is a 5 minute bus ride just outside the town. \\n-The Puente de Dios cave and falls are a 10 min drive in the other direction outside of town. (Closed to all swimming activity during rainy season mid-June through December)\\n- The Micos Falls are a 15 min bus ride outside of Ciudad Valles.\\n- The Temazcal Cascades are a 5 minute walk up the road from the parking lot of the Edward James Surreal Gardens. \\n- The Tamul Falls is one of the more isolated waterfalls, but well worth finding.  It\\'s best to access it from the direction of Aquism\\u00f3n. The actual waterfall is only accessible by boat. You can arrange a half day tour in Aquism\\u00f3n, and often at the river itself. It takes about two hours to paddle upstream to the waterfall. \\n\\n8. Hot springs - Hotel Taninul, famous for its hot springs, is a popular resort located 25 miles east of Ciudad Valles. \\n\\n9. Archaeological Zones - Tamu\\u00edn:\\nTamtok and El Consuelo display remnants of the Huastecan culture between the years 600-900, and are located just after the turn off to the Hotel Taninul, on the right.\\n\\n10. Caverns and caves - there are a variety of caverns throughout the Huasteca south and west of Ciudad Valles, 2 hrs south of Rio Verde (the Arroyo Seco area), and around Xilitla. \\n\\n11. La Media Luna - this &quot;Half Moon Lagoon&quot; is a small lake about 30 minutes outside of Rio Verde (which is two hours east of San Luis Potos\\u00ed). Though it is small, it is ideal for swimming and scuba diving, due to warm (86\\u00b0), extraordinarily crystal-clear, azure water that becomes profoundly deep once you venture past its shallow fingers. \\n\\n12. Authentic Huastecan towns:\\n- Apezco - This is a small mountain village to the west of Xilitla with amazing  views, reached via a 1-2 hr hike up a steep, dirt road. \\n- Tancanhuitz de Santos (Ciudad Santos) is located South of Cd Valles about 40 min north of Xilitla. Look for a turnoff to the right about 20 minutes after you pass through Huichihuay\\u00e1n.  Typical Huastecan dress, handicrafts, and a church built on top of an ancient Huastecan pyramid can all be seen here. Market day in Santos is Sunday.\\n- Huehuetl\\u00e1n - This is one of the prettiest towns in the area, located on a hilltop above a long, wide flight of stairs. Many trees, bright flowers, and vines make this town picturesque. Take the first turn to your right after the town of Ciudad Santos, cross the bridge, then turn left.\\n- Axtla de Terrazas / Aguacatitla -- Axtla is a small town about 5 miles outside of Xilitla. At Axtla, turn right to go down to cross the R\\u00edo Moctezuma on a small ferry.  A few miles ahead, on a gravel road is Aguacatitla, a main hub of medicinal herbal &quot;potions&quot;. \\n\\nI didn\\'t mention EVERYTHING by name. There are at least 8 major waterfalls throughout the region, 4 or 5 main rivers, and endless cliffs, caves, and caverns to explore. This is truly an area you could visit yearly and never run out of new things to see and do. \\n\\nLODGING:\\nYou can always find lodging without reservations in the rainy season and off-seasons like January, February, and probably early May. Otherwise, I\\'d recommend reservations a few months ahead even when it means paying more. The cheapest and most plentiful lodging can be found in Ciudad Valles, but honestly, it\\'s a pit of a town and the most humid of the entire area. Hot! Hot! Hot! And not in a good way. \\n I\\'d recommend Tamosopo as a launching pad near the north and southwest activities, and either Aquism\\u00f3n - or the more expensive Xilitla - to be near the activities in the east. They are all very small, quaint towns, but you can still find adequate 2 and 3 star hotels with beautiful surroundings, adequate accommodations, restaurants (although I wouldn\\'t eat in the hotel restaurants), hot water, and vending machines. \\n\\nGETTING TO THE HUASTECA: \\n1. Fly into the nearest major airport:\\n- Fly into Mexico City and drive/bus to Xilitla or San Luis Potos\\u00ed, roughly 7-8hrs. \\n-  Fly into Guadalajara and bus 5-6 hrs to San Luis Potos\\u00ed.\\n\\n2. Fly into a smaller, closer, much more expensive airport:\\n- the following airports are three times the cost and will NOT save time, as all routes to these airports are via another airport (usually Mexico City) and incur long layovers (6-12 hrs):\\n- San Luis Potos\\u00ed, Tampico, Quer\\u00e9taro, Le\\u00f3n/Bah\\u00eda, or Aguascalientes. \\n\\n3. Bus from the US:\\n- Take an 8 hr bus from several Texas border cities. \\n\\nIf you need more specific advice on bus transportation once you\\'re within the region, read my July 2015 reviews on Hotel Cosmos near Tamasopo, Hotel d\\'Carmona in Ciudad Valles, Cascadas Tamasopo, Edward James Surreal Gardens (and las pozas), and Hotel Dolores in Xilitla. \\n\\nIn short, do not let the traveler warnings deter you from visiting one of the most beautiful areas in Mexico (and there are SO many!) Just plan well and use  common sense. \\n\\nHope that helps. Enjoy the Huasteca! \\n\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Huasteca Potosina", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/36/6a/4a/huasteca-potosina.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Valles", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "78395", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "335528223": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Hidden Paradise", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499409-d3228730-Reviews-Huasteca_Potosina-Ciudad_Valles_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/36/6a/4a/huasteca-potosina.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Of all the times I\\'ve been to S.L.P.

This part of Mexico is amazing in that the ecosystem changes radically it seems like every 50 miles or so.   Tamasopo is very much in a jungle and it is a place where water flows out of the ground and mountains as if the earth were just pouring at the seams here.\\n\\nHonestly there is so much to do in the entire region from Rioverde to Tamasopo to Xilitla and more but just for this review I am focusing on Puente Del Dios but for sure it should be part of a multi-day or even couple of week trip if possible.   We only had 4 days for the region and it was just not enough.\\n\\nI hope to return in the future and stay and visit more of the waterfalls, caves and other attractions.\\n\\nBack to Puente Del Dios.   This is a day trip - you can spend a full day there because there are multiple swimming spots along the way.   Check out the attached photos - the water is so blue and clean it\\'s hard to actually get your head around it.  It looks like the color of the Caribbean but it\\'s fresh water.   They have it set up with ropes so that you can swim just below where the water is pouring out of the falls.  You can either jump off a medium sized rock jump to get in or walk around to a place where you can just enter as you would a lake.\\n\\nThe drive from San Luis Potosi is a couple of hours.  It was part of a trip where we drove from Texas to Cancun for us so I can\\'t give the best flight information.  All I can say is that it\\'s beyond worth however it means to get there.\\n\\nI thought it was pretty interesting that in the most recent Lonely Planet guide it\\'s not even mentioned.  The state of San Luis Potosi gets only a couple of pages.    For us this meant that we were the only tourists in town and we got the whole place to ourselves.   The guide told us that on the weekends it\\'s jam packed with Mexicans - easy to imagine because it\\'s so gorgeous.  Also during the Spring and Summer there can be hundreds of people there in a day.  Go in the Winter (we were there in Feb).  The nights are chilly but the days are great for swimming.  You\\'ll never forget it!\\n\\nSort of rambling but a couple of important parts\\n - Organize a ride up from Tamasopo - this cost us only $100 pesos (about $8 US) - even if you have a car you don\\'t want to drive to the watercourse.\\n- The hike is pretty serious - a lot of steps that can be slippery.   No problem for someone in decent shape and well put together and maintained step system but not for a couch potato.\\n- Your ride might be a guide - ours was but if you take a taxi probably not - Our guide was nice, informative and took as much time as we wanted and was just for a tip (I gave him $100 - he stayed with us for 3 hours).  You could do it without a guide - it\\'s very clearly marked - but the guide worked well for us.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Huasteca Potosina", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/36/6a/4a/huasteca-potosina.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Valles", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "78395", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "193494467": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Outstanding", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499409-d3228730-Reviews-Huasteca_Potosina-Ciudad_Valles_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/36/6a/4a/huasteca-potosina.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This area is full of natural wonders.

After 20 min, it leaves you near a mirador, as to go beat the river you have to take a little stair which is a bit before the mirador on the right side of the street. Once you get down you have to pay 10 pesos/person to be there ... \\n\\nThings to do : People will propose to you &quot;Saltos de cascadas&quot; which is jumping from one cascade to another (there are about 7). This will cost around 150 pesos/person and is really worth  it ! They show you were to jump, they bring you under cascade... The cascades go from 2 to 9m. Then of course you can just enjoy swimming in the river. \\n\\nTo eat : For lunch a bit further on the right, there are little &quot;restaurants&quot; where you can enjoy chicken cooked on the BBQ with rice and tortilla for 40 to 80 pesos ! \\n\\nTo go back : to Cuidad Valles, there are buses every hour around 40/45 just at the top of the stairs. \\n\\nTAMASOPO \\n\\nTo go : from Cuidad Valles you have a bus that goes to Tamasopo, it takes 2:00 hours to get there. \\n\\nTo sleep : We hadn\\'t booked any hotel and found one called ... for about 390 pesos. \\n\\nTo eat : We had diner and breakfast in the restaurant just next to the hotel. Prices and food were ok. \\n\\nThings to do : we started by going to Puente de dios which is less crowded in the morning. There you can see a big waterfall, swim in caves, jump from high points, or just go a bit farther along the stream (nearly nobody) to find your little spot to picnic and to relax! \\nThen we went to Tamasopo cascades, very nice place with lots of place to swim but quite crowded during WE ! You\\'ll also be able to admire the vestiges of a water mill. There are little restaurants to enjoy a lunch near the stream. \\n\\nXILITLA \\n\\nTo go : from Cuidad Valles there are busses that go, they take around 2:00 to get there.\\n\\nTo sleep : there are 2 or 3 hotels in this village, we divided to sleep at hotel del cielo, quite nice, very clean and comfortable. \\n\\nTo eat : on Saturday night we had diner in Casa Vieja Cafe, we spent an incredible night, food was good, there was a guitarist and singer playing, the place was full and everybody was joyful !  On Sundays there is a bug market so we decided to have chilaquiles on the market, mmh! So good ! \\n\\nThings to do : you can not miss the surrealistic garden of Edward James ! It is incredible and there is so much to see ! After your visit you can go and enjoy a swim in the cascades of the gardens, on WE after 11:00 it is completely crowded. Xilitla is completely different from Cuidad and Tamasopo, it is a nice little village with animation and a cute center ! On Sundays it\\'s really nice to walk around and discover local products ! \\n\\nTo go back to Mexico City : there is a bus that leaves from Xilitla 4 times per day. \\n\\nHope this will help others plan there trip :)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Huasteca Potosina", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/36/6a/4a/huasteca-potosina.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Valles", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "78395", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "169775363": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Puente De Dios is Beautiful!!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499409-d3228730-Reviews-Huasteca_Potosina-Ciudad_Valles_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/36/6a/4a/huasteca-potosina.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We traveled to Tamosopo San Luis Potosi last week and visited Puente De Dios.

We walked up river through woodland with constant views of the river and rapids before arriving at La puente de Dios, a powerful waterfall where my son and I dived in (Jorge provided us with life jackets) and using ropes laid out across the current we could half swim half pull our way across to a smaller waterfall and climb under it, we swam through a cave/rock bridge with clear bluish water where we could see fish before reluctantly climbing out to rejoin my wife who was happy just to watch and enjoy the beauty of the place.  Later with our life jackets we could float back down the river to the start point, where we continued onto the biggest waterfall of all: Tamasopo.  Splendid scenery, exuberant vegetation and places to eat.  My wife and I chose to stroll and enjoy thar area, whilst my 13 year old son along with local kids could swing from a rope hanging from a tree and drop or dive or somesault into the deep pool below the fall....which kept him happy for at least an hour.\\nWe paid about 90 euros for the three of us...it was like a private tour as nobody else had booked that day.  In fact we saw little tourism in the area in spite of the natural beauty.\\nWe were going to go on another tour (there were many choices and Jorge was willing to customize the tour for us) the next day to another waterfall and to the S\\u00f3tano de las Golondrinas (cave of the swallows), but the weather turned bad and we moved south.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Huasteca Potosina", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/36/6a/4a/huasteca-potosina.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Valles", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "78395", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "150429045": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Contrast", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499409-d3228730-Reviews-Huasteca_Potosina-Ciudad_Valles_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/36/6a/4a/huasteca-potosina.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "San Luis Potos\\u00ed capital is mostly a semi arid  area.

Amazingly well-organized tour company.  Not to sound condescending (because I certainly am not) but I have had well over 8 years of various experiences with Mexican run companies (marinas, solar panels, contractors, tours, resorts, painters, etc), and so many are not organized that I never get my hopes up as not to be disappointed.  \\n\\nThis Mexican tour company blew my socks off.  They always responded nearly at once to any of my questions before the tour.  They paid attention to endless details. They were knowledgeable and cheerful.  They were superb with safety (driving slow in the rain, not passing on double lanes, use of seat belts, double checking of life jackets and helmets before entering the water, etc.).  \\n\\nThey paid for tips, entry fees, and some snacks, so you don\\u2019t have to carry much cash (only for personal purchases like coffees, drinks, souvenirs).  They have special parking privileges so you don\\u2019t have to walk a kilometer to the entrance of crowded areas.  \\n\\nThere is no pressure to buy from the vendors we visited which can be a hassle with some tour companies.  \\n\\nI even witnessed them helping out two people who did not even belong on the tour.  Giving excellent meaningful pointers, etc.  For minimal cost, they take pictures for you, so your camera stays safe and dry.  In a nutshell, very professional.  I repeatedly saw many of them pick up trash to help keep the sites we visited clean.\\n\\nI took the full seven-day ecotour and didn\\u2019t regret one day even though my first day was spent in torrential rain, Edgar made it sound and feel fun and the day went by very fast.  On the following day, America shared her knowledge about many other interesting places to visit in Mexico once she noticed my interest.  They have a couple of guides who speak English and German, not sure about French.  I am fortunate to speak fluent Spanish, so I didn\\u2019t need that service.  \\n\\nAll the guides I encountered (17 of them) were engaged, fun, eager to please, knowledgeable, patient and good-natured.  But the highlight of all seven days was the rafting on the Tampeon River, which is not part of the ecotour package but since there weren\\'t enough people to go on the tour I had arranged, Ruta Huasteca upgraded me to the rafting - A gift from heaven I will always cherish.\\n\\nWe were given thorough safety explanations and drills before heading downriver.  The river\\u2019s water was so tepid you could swim in it for kilometers without getting cold.  The trip is 16km long and involves a few class III rapids.  With 10 people in two rafts, we were accompanied by 3 kayakers for scouting, rescue (of people or paddles), safety, and photos.  Even though the guides know the river well, they didn\\u2019t take anything for granted and before each rapid, kayakers would explore for possible logs or other unforeseen problems.  \\n\\nOnce the go ahead was given we would follow them in our inflatable rafts, following instructions from our each of our guides.  In the calmer areas, we were given the choice to stay in the rafts or swim\\u2026  Idyllic conditions.  \\n\\nAt one point the river goes underground and portage of the rafts and kayaks is necessary.  To re-enter the water, you can jump down about 5 meters into the water or walk down \\u2013 depending of your level of comfort and competence.\\n\\nAt the end, and after fun competition between the two rafts, we were served an excellent meal outdoors by the river.  \\n\\nI truly can\\u2019t say enough about Ruta Huasteca.  I will use them again to visit other parts of Mexico.  Their pricing is also extremely fair and affordable.  \\n\\nThank you for a great adventure in a beautiful and superbly scenic setting.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ruta Huasteca Expediciones", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/6d/6a/a9/rafting-ruta-huasteca.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Boulevard Mexico Laredo # 820 Glorieta Hidalgo Colonia Morales", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Valles", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "79080", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "651565309": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Yoga Retreat", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499409-d7602100-Reviews-Ruta_Huasteca_Expediciones-Ciudad_Valles_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/6d/6a/a9/rafting-ruta-huasteca.jpg", "datePublished": "February 11, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I went on a trip there a while ago--and have been meaning to review (over a year).

I recommend you to stay there.\\nYou can go with friends, couple or by your self.. anyways you will met new people with your same interests, make new friends.\\nWe was thinking to met the Huasteca by ourselves or with another agency to save some money, but we definitely take the best decision.\\nWe can\\'t visit Tamul because the weather, but it still was a great travel.\\nI strongly recommend visit Huasteca with Ruta Huasteca for people of every country.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ruta Huasteca Expediciones", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/6d/6a/a9/rafting-ruta-huasteca.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Boulevard Mexico Laredo # 820 Glorieta Hidalgo Colonia Morales", "addressLocality": "Ciudad Valles", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "79080", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "403344407": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Great Guides", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499409-d7602100-Reviews-Ruta_Huasteca_Expediciones-Ciudad_Valles_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/6d/6a/a9/rafting-ruta-huasteca.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I would highly recommend booking you tour with Ruta.
