Four heroic scale paintings illustrate the conversion of the indigenous people in what can only be described as blatant sentimentalism, but given the sanctuary\\'s dedication to the Virgin of Guadalupe, a dark skinned Virgin who appeared to Juan Diego and became an effective tool for connecting with indigenous religious beliefs, it is not that surprising to find that theme central to the decorative scheme. \\n\\nGiven the sumptuous beauty of the interior, it is somewhat surprising to find that it is generally uncrowded, offering a place for quiet reflection and plenty of opportunities to sit and stare at the glittering surroundings.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Guadalupe Sanctuary", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/ca/f7/01/santuario-de-guadalupe.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Morelia", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "282430911": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A must to know place", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g152771-d247813-Reviews-Guadalupe_Sanctuary-Morelia_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/ca/f7/01/santuario-de-guadalupe.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "It is a beautiful architectural place you must know in Morelia.

The entrance fee is not too experience and you can choose if you want to include the special rides, such as the train (takes you around the pond and flamingos among other areas), the truck, (goes closer to more African style zoo area) and the house of snakes. You can buy this at entrance ar pay once you are inside. We have an excellent day here as family and i can recommend this place for  every family. Animals are nothing out of the extraordinary, but this place guarantees a good day with the family.

But the note I found on your site by a former student was disheartening, if true. They do have a summer music program for extranjeros in July, which I was thinking of looking into for my violin and viola playing high school daughter. However, i have no first hand experience of the instruction or level of students at the conservatory. There are many music students in and around central Morelia. It would be shame if the Conservatorio is a front for something else, or living on past reputation; that is certainly NOT the opinion of many Morelianos and a couple violin students I talked to (in spanish) about it.  Also, the new director was quoted in the newspaper as saying the school needed to reflect the diversity of the population (maybe in reference to rich students from Mexico City?)  and new types of music and composing, while preserving the tradition of classical music.\\n\\nWhile there we attended a beautiful free concert of the sinfonia orquesta de Michoacan (state orchestra) with a wonderful opera singer in the Catedral de Morelia. The concert was full of young people and music students--way more that you would see at a classical music concert anywhere in the SF Bay Area and they were truly into the music.

The story goes that it disappeared some decades ago and had to be created again but I am not sure about the validity of the story. Next to it is the small park named Villalongin which is also a lovely statue and fountain. In addition to the two fountains you will also find the Callejon (alleyway) de Romance. It\\'s a short narrow walk that is most attractive with homes on both sides and a church and lots of flowers. In addition to all  this the aqueduct that Morelia is famous for ends here after running for a few KMs. There is a large public park on one side of the aqueduct that has a couple of museums, lots of cafes and restaurants, schools, and a 500 meter walk way to another popular plaza with a huge statue of Morelos and the Guadaloupe church. \\nIf you are in Morelia this area is a must and once there you can spend a couple of hours checking out what I have described and more if you stop for a bite or a drink. The fountain is just one of the several things to see in this part of town. To get to all this just walk east along Madero until you come to the Tarascas Fountain. It\\'s maybe a walk of a full KM from the cathedral to the fountain (maybe a mile). Go if you are in Morelia.

To begin with, there were lovely sculptures of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in the outer courtyard.  I wandered around the colonial courtyard and discovered a wonderful bookstore.  The books they offer have to do with art, indigenous cultures (especially Perebecha), and Morelian and general Mexican history.\\nI wandered a little further, and sat on a bench to eat a snack. As I rested, I watched some theater students practicing a fistfight scene.  \\nThere was a marvelous juried photography exhibit in one chamber.  A little later, I saw a curator begin to move that exhibit to another salon.  It was interesting just to watch that process take place.\\nI walked up the grand staircase, and as I did so I could hear captivating guitar music. One of the professors, a French man, was rehearsing some Indian music that he had been exploring.  He stopped playing long enough to explain his study to me.\\nI made my way down several hallways, admiring the former cells with their beautiful wooden doors.  Almost every cell has become a studio or rehearsal area.\\nAt one point, a custodian asked me if I\\'d like to enter the cupola.  She unlocked it to show me around.

As you approach the building on Av Acueducto, you can\\'t miss the enormous, ancient, stone aqueduct out front, running for miles down the middle of the street.  The museum is housed in an architecturally fascinating Victorian mansion.  The interior was renovated into a first class modern art exhibit space, but still retains some beautiful vintage details.\\n\\nThe museum is named after an amazing, underrated giant of Mexican art, Alfredo Zalce, who lived and worked in Morelia for many years.  His work is always on display in one of the galleries, while the rest of the museum has constantly changing shows of very high quality art from Mexico and around the world.  When I was there, just after the Day of the Dead, his gallery had several original prints, all related to that theme.  This place provides a rare opportunity to always see a selection of his original work, including a few large sculptures in the yard outside.\\n\\nAlfredo Zalce created an enormous body of diverse artwork over a long life.  He lived until his mid 90s, and passed away in 2003.  Over a very long career, he worked in a wide variety of medium:  paintings, sculpture, ceramics, drawings, photography and more, but most of all, printmaking.  He was a key member of the Taller de Gr\\u00e1fica Popular, a vibrant and prolific center for printmaking in Mexico City, that thrived in the 1930s and 40s.  So this museum has an enormous wealth of his artwork to select from for carefully curated exhibits.

V\\u00e1monos por partes en este lugar abren todos los d\\u00edas del a\\u00f1os en un horario de 6 pm a 10 pm lo m\\u00e1s recomendable es llegar ente 7 y  9 de la noche. En la parte del s\\u00f3tano tendr\\u00e1s que tener un estimado para comer toda la comida que te venden. Las enchiladas de pollo son mis favoritas ,tambi\\u00e9n las venden solas , los panbanzos me vuelven loco. Las gorditas ,los sopes ,los taquitos dorados ,el pozole rojo de cerdo y el blanco de pollo ,las quesadillas de comal ,los bu\\u00f1uelos ,los tamales ,los uchepos ,las corundas .Bueno dejemos a un lado la comida y te platico unos datos muy importantes para cuando te animes a visitar este lugar.
