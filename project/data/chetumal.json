You spend a couple of hours on the bus each way and get about an hour at each location.\\n\\nAccording to our guide (and my memory!), the ruins at Dzibanche include more ritual areas.  They were pyramids used as part of religious activities.  It includes several pyramids that you can climb to look around and a few include interesting carvings.  I had previously been to San Gervaiso which includes much smaller ruins.  Being able to climb these tall pyramids provided an interesting view and perspective on the impressive architecture of the Mayans.\\n\\nThe ruins at Kohunlich cover a wider area and include more aspects of Mayan life.  They include residences, offices, religious activities, etc.  There is also a pyramid there that is named the Temple of the Masks and you get a great view of masks that were carved into the rock.  Walking around Kohunlich gives you more of a feel for what it must have been like for a Mayan person to walk around a town that they had built.\\n\\nTogether our group of tweens to adults found the sites very impressive and we thoroughly enjoyed the day.

Seeing the ruins this way is highly recommended, as you can avoid the tour buses and tour groups and set your own schedule. \\nThe ruins are about an hour from Chetumal, well-signed on the highway. The roads are good all the way, with the last little bit on a paved but narrow road from the highways. A few potholes but nothing serious, and we had to slow down and pull over to let a tour bus pass. \\nWe arrived about 9:30 in the morning, and I think if we had been an hour earlier we would have have the ruins all to ourselves! Entry fee as of Feb 2018 is 70 pesos per person. \\nAt the entrance is a ticket booth and a washroom with flush toilets. NO food, NO amenities. And also NO touts or sellers (hooray!) This site really does just have the ruins. \\nThere is a map at the ticket booth, recommend taking a photo of it so you can follow the recommended path through the site. Buildings have plaques with short explanations on them in Spanish and English (some are very brief). \\nYou can climb pretty much all over everything and explore - dangerous places are roped off. \\nThe key attraction at this site is the temple of the masks at the very back of the site (that\\'s where the tour that beat us spent most of their time with the guide). You can climb up the steps in the middle, with the huge mask carvings on either side. The carvings are roped off and protected by palapa roofs. They\\'re fantastically preserved and very impressive. \\nThe other most impressive structure on the site is the 27 steps, with (naturally) lots of steps, turrets, rounded stone corners, and plazas. \\nThe site has quite a bit of shade, but we recommend taking sunblock and bug spray with you. Take a bottle of water with you, and maybe a snack, as there aren\\'t any shops once you arrive at the site. \\nOverall an impressive, quiet, Mayan site with some unique features.

An impressive copy of one of the murals at Bonampak, by Pedro Davalos is probly worth the visit alone. The basement has a  mock up of a \\'sacred cave\\' with figures, pottery and a sound effects system. There is also a full scale copy of the burial crypt at Copan, of the son of SmokeImixGod K from year 695. Under a thick glass floor 4 to 6 feet below there is a model of the Palace at Palenque. Out side in the courtyard (there is no need to pay for this) there is a &quot;Mayan&quot; hut with a fireplace, rustic furnature and a few tools. The offices in this area contain an art gallery or 2, bookstore, and a few friendly workers home offices.

The bus was modern and had a restroom at the rear.  It was well air conditioned.  Prior to entering the ruins, we stopped to get our entry tickets and restroom facilities were provided and it gave us a chance to stretch our legs.\\nWe were told that this is one of the only set of ruins that allows you to climb the temples in Mexico any more.  It was interesting seeing workers restoring the ruins while we visited.  The North South temple is extremely impressive.  Some of the Temples still have the original red coloring on the stones to help you get an idea of what they looked like in their glory days.  \\nIf you go in July, it is HOT but there are a lot of trees surrounding the area to take refuge from the heat.  The tour company provided us all with 2 bottles of water and a &quot;bagged lunch&quot;.  Lunch consisted of a granola bar, banana and a candy bar in the AM along with a small bottle of water.  After visiting the Dzibanche ruins they gave us a Ham &amp; Cheese sandwich on white bread with mayonnaise. (if you held the ham up it would be transparent LOL) and a larger bottle of water., however it did the job of sustaining us.  We then traveled @ 1/2 hour (closer to the port) to the Kohunlich ruins.  The Kohunlich ruins have the giant kohulich palm trees and these ruins have the beautiful Temple of the Masks. \\nMake sure you bring a brimmed hat and sunscreen.  We also brought the Mosquito repellent bracelets to keep pests away.  There are no ropes to hold onto while climbing the ruins.  If you have balance issues, DO NOT CLIMB!

They were pyramids used as part of religious activities.  It includes several pyramids that you can climb to look around and a few include interesting carvings.

They include residences, offices, religious activities, etc.  There is also a pyramid there that is named the Temple of the Masks and you get a great view of masks that were carved into the rock.  Walking around Kohunlich gives you more of a feel for what it must have been like for a Mayan person to walk around a town that they had built.\\n\\nTogether our group of tweens to adults found the sites very impressive and we thoroughly enjoyed the day.

There are two ruins that are high and gives a lovley view over the surrounding jungle, however you are allowed to climb at the smaller ruins, as well. I would recommend you to do that if you are there. However the steps are high and nothing for small children, elderly people, people with bad balance or people with fear of highs and people with leg- or kneeproblems. \\nIf you fall and break a foot you have to travel a long distance to the nearest hospital, so please walk slowly and carefully on the ruins.\\n\\nThere are also carvings from the mayan indians on one ruin, however the masks and carvings at the nearby ruins of Kohunlich are more spectacular (even though the ruins of Dzibanche are more spectacular), but they are still fun to watch and to think that there acctually lived people at Dzibanche a thousand years ago.\\n\\nSome ruins at Dzibanche are not fully archeologically searched and dug out, so you can see some ruins covered with soil and trees, so you can almost feel like an explorer, exploring the temples and jungles of Central America.\\n\\nAround the ruins of Dzibanche there is jungle and forests, so you can get shade when you look at the ruins, necessary, since there is always hot and sunny at the ruins of Dzibanche (do not forget to bring water and sunscreen with you). \\nThe paths and trails leading around at the ruins of Dzibanche are small, but not steep, and a bit uneven, since roots from trees are sometimes going over the paths and trails.\\nTo visit the ruins of Dzibanche is possible for everyone, however persons with strollers, and wheelchairs may have big problems with the roots (see above).\\nSmall children, teenagers and adults interested in history and culture will have a great time at the ruins of Dzibanche. It is hard not to like the ruins of Dzibanche.\\n\\nThe nearby (about 20 kilometers/30 minutes) ruins of Kohunlich are smaller, but whith much more carvings than the ruins at Dziabche. At Dzibanche you really lose your breath when you see the ruins the first time, you do not lose your breath at the ruins of Kohunlich.\\nHowever the masks and carvings are much more extensive at the ruins of Kohunlich, at Dzibanche there are only some smaller carvings and no masks. \\nAt Dzibanche there are only ruins that are temples and tombs, but at Kohunlich you get to see more different constructions: one temple, palaces, ruins of houses and a ball court. So the ruins of Kohunlich is more extensive and there are more numbers of them, at Dzibanche there are fewer ruins, but those who are, are higher. \\nAt Kohunlich you get a better understanding of how the mayans lived.\\nThe ruins themselfs are more dramatic and more well preserved at Dzibanche, but the carvings are much more incredible at the ruins of Kohunlich. However the ruins of Dzibanche is not completely archeologially explored, which the ruins at Kohunlich is.\\nIf you only have time to visit one of the ruins I would recommend you to visit Kohunlich.\\nIf you are going to visit Chich\\u00e9n Itz\\u00e1 and only have time to see one of the ruins, I would recommend you to see Dzibanche, but if you will not see Chich\\u00e9n Itz\\u00e1 I would recommend you to visit Kohunlich.\\n\\nIf compare the ruins of Dzibanche to Chich\\u00e9n Itz\\u00e1, the ruins of Dzibanche is much smaller, Chich\\u00e9n Itz\\u00e1 is both higher, wider, bigger and more breathtaking, but the ruins of Dzibanche are still outstanding and the fact that they are located in the middle of the jungle, in the middle of nowhere, far from big roads and civilasaition makes the ruins of Dzibanche even more spectacular, even though Chich\\u00e9n Itz\\u00e1 is more breathtaking. \\nDzibanche is also not turistic, there are no shops or vendors there, which makes the atmosphere more stressfree realxing and natural. At Chich\\u00e9n Itz\\u00e1 there are vendors and stores everywhere.\\nAt Dzibanche there is almost no people at all (when I where there my group where the only one that was there), however at Chich\\u00e9n Itz\\u00e1 there is always a lot of people (even though it is not crowded).  \\n\\nThe ruins of Dzibanche are located in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the Mexican jungle, far from big roads and towns, it is really remote, on the countryside.\\nIt takes about two and a half hour from Costa Maya to the ruins of Dzibanche and on your way you pass sugarcane fields, banana-plantages, small villages where the locals sells pineappels, so as you can see, it is a charming trip, even though most of the trip is on very straight roads only with view of the jungle and very thick jungles (but then you can take a relaxing moment to sleep, so you are well rested when you arrive to the ruins). The roads are good and not bumpy and people drive rather carefully, so you can have a safe trip. Our bus had seat-belts.\\n\\nI where at the ruins of Dzibanche (and Kohunlich) on a shore excursion, booked thorugh Norwegian Cruise Line and we had an amazing day, both at the ruins of Dzibanche, and at Kohunlich. We had an air-conditioned bus, which was very comfortable and a sandwhich (not vegeterian) and water bottles were provided. \\nOur guide, Arturo was really good and told us everything we sought to know about the ruins.\\n\\nIf you are to visit the ruins of Dzibanche (which I hope you will) you really must bring water bottles with water, sunscreen, sunhat and something to eat with you, since there are absolutly no shops at the ruins of Dzibanche or nearby and there is often very hot and sunny. When I where there in April there were no mosquitos or nasty insects, but if you are to visit the ruins of Dzibanche I would still recommend you to bring insect repellent, since you never know if there is going to be mosquitos.\\nThere are toilets, that you can use for free. \\n\\nI would really recommend you all to visit the lovley ruins of Dzibanche! \\nYou will not regret it!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Dzibanche", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/32/e7/df/temple.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Chetumal", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "569110949": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Incredible!

People kept telling us not to book shore excursions on our own and always go through the cruise line, especially when traveling far away from the port. I read all of the reviews about Native Choice and decided to chance it. I\\'m glad that I did. \\n\\nWe had to walk about 2 blocks out of the port to get to their office, but it was easy to find. They had many different tours going in various directions, but we loaded after about a 20 minute wait. We were in a 16 passenger van which was very nice with racks above for your gear and air vents to keep it cool. Our guide was Lorenzo. The first thing he did was ask exactly when we all needed to be back at the port. He let us know that the plan was to have us back at least an hour before that.\\n\\nOn the way, he gave us great information on the history and area as we rode about 2 hours to Dzibanche. We went through some towns where they were selling pineapples and harvesting sugarcane.\\n\\nWhen we got to Dzibanche, Lorenzo took us to the different structures, explaining each one, and letting us climb 2 of the pyramids. That\\'s what sets this apart from so many of the others. You don\\'t just walk and look, you actually get to climb to the top and see across the whole area. We got to take our time, ask questions and walk around the entire area. It was not rushed at all.\\n\\nAfter getting back in the van, we stopped at the bathrooms before the trip back. Lorenzo passed out sandwiches, chips, granola bars and water which we could eat on the way back. I read some complaints about this, but really that\\'s all you need. Maybe it\\'s because we\\'re used to packing a lunch before we head out on an adventure.\\n\\nThe trip back was quiet, with many people napping. We stopped briefly to take in the view of a cenote. It was then back to the port. We got there with plenty of time to spare, and our family even stopped in a shop or two.\\n\\nThis was an incredible site for our kids to see and I would highly recommend it. I would also have no hesitation in booking with Native Choice. They were well organized and very concerned about making sure we were all back in time.

This was after we had used his services in a prior visit to the Chacchoben Mayan Ruins northwest of Bacalar, having had a spectacularly good time learning about the ancient and sophisticated Mayan culture and civilization. Being of Mayan descent himself, Reggie was extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic in telling us about the unique details of each site. He also taught us much about the flora, fauna, and animal life of each locality. He spoke excellent English and had a fantastic sense of humor, such that we felt entirely comfortable kidding back and forth during our time spent together. In fact, on a later occasion back in Bacalar, we invited Reggie and his beautiful wife Elizabeth to meet us at a restaurant for dinner, getting to know them on a more personal level, and coming to an even greater appreciation of what genuine, good-hearted people they are. The Dzibanche, Kohunlich, and Chacchoben ruins were all very impressive and exciting to see in their largely intact jungle settings, and without the crowds of people that flock to the more barren landscape of Chichen Itza, which my wife and I have also visited. New discoveries are still being made and being prepared for public viewing at these sites, and you get the sense that you are seeing, literally, groundbreaking archeological finds that few people have yet seen. We thoroughly appreciated Reggie\\'s unhurried guidance through all of the sites, allowing us to take plenty of photos for a lifetime of good memories and sharing with others.

You would ,however, need a rental car in order to drive some 200 miles or roughly 350 km from the Cancun area and the Riviera Maya to Chetumal, the capital of the Mexican state of Quintanaroo located at  the southern  end of the Yucatan peninsula close to the borders of Belize and Guatemala. Because of the distance between Cancun or the Riviera Maya and the Chetumal area and the fact that there are no tourist accomodations available near Dzibanche you may want to stay overnight in either Chetumal or Bacalar. Bacalar is known for the clear blue water of the Bacalar Lagoon and probably the better choice for a hotel right at the lagoon. \\n\\nFrom either Bacalar or Chetumal you follow the signs to Carretera (federal highway) 186 in the direction of  Escarcega. After roughly 35 miles or 55 km on 186  you will see the blue sign on the right hand side of the highway directing you to Dzibanche. You leave the highway and follow a small country road for the remaining 15 miles (some 25 km) to the ruins of Dzibanche. While driving on the carretera is fine, the country road for the remaining distance to the ruins \\nis covered with potholes and cracks of the pavement on the sides will require you to go slow. But the driving experience on Mexican countryroads for visiting Dzibanche, a unique site located virtually in the middle of the jungle, is very much worth the effort. The silence at the surpringly well kept site was only interrupted by the singing of birds and playful monkeys. We found Dzibanche absolutely magnificent and except for a Mexican family were the only visitors during the entire time of our 4 hour visit. Make sure you bring plenty of water as there is no place to buy anything at the ruins. If you speak Spanish the ranger supervising the site will answer most of your questions and turned out to be very helpful. What we liked most at this vast site with numerous temples, pyramids and sacred structures was not only the feeling to be in the middle of the jungle but also that there were almost no signs and ropes prohibiting the access to the buildings and pyramids. Being allowed to climb up to the top of the various structures and exploring the sacred buildings without the typical tourist crowd was sensational!\\nNot to mention the breathtaking views of the vast site and the thick jungle from the top of the pyramids. \\n\\nAfter visiting Dzibanche the ranger recommended that we don`t miss the large acropolis of nearby Kinich-Na, only a mile away. The acropolis was at one time part of Dzibanche and is the only building complex at this site, but what a magnificent structure with various temples on three levels. A climb up to the third level of the acropolis will give you a terrific  view of the area which you will not forget. \\n\\nIf you are interested in Mayan ruins and want to get a feel of what it was like visiting Chichenitza, Tulum or Coba some 40 years ago,  you should visit  Dzibanche and Kinich-Na if you have the time.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Dzibanche", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/32/e7/df/temple.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Chetumal", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "158508746": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Excellent day trip from cruise port", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g317139-d152770-Reviews-Dzibanche-Chetumal_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/32/e7/df/temple.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Our family (mom,dad,and 2 teens) just returned from West Carib cruise.

The company was launching a number of tours near the port at Costa Maya and were efficient and organized in getting the shows on the road. It was about a two hour drive to Dzibanche with one pit stop enroute. The twenty miles or so from the port is mostly swamp and undeveloped. Might be boring to some but we found it fascinating. The last part of the trip goes through miles of sugar cane fields that were being harvested. Dzibanche is remote and I think we were the third and last group of the day to visit. It is well restored and maintained. It is good sized but not huge. Our guide Francisco had done considerable research into this site and his knowledge exceeded what you would normally expect from a guide. The site is organized into clusters of squares and temples, often from different periods. The beauty is hard to describe - pictures tell a better story. We climbed the tallest pyramid which has a view of near by Kohunlich. Getting up was okay, getting down was an adventure. If you have an issue with heights, as I do, go down slowly backwards or on your rear end step by step. For the last 45 - 60 minutes we [about 12] were the only group at  the site. It really felt like you were in another era.  On the trip the van had mechanical problems and eventually came to a full stop an hour away from the ship. I was impressed with the way Francisco and the driver handled the situation. They were in constant contact with their office, another van was dispatched from Costa Maya and a tour that had gone to Kohunlich stopped had took on a number of us. We were never in any danger of missing the boat and arrived back at Costa Maya before some of the ship sponsored excursions.

There is a shaded path for a few hundred meters to the site, which has several large pyramids including one which has the best surviving Mayan woodwork on a lintel near the top. Most pyramids are climbable although one at the back is being restored and closed.. Two big tour buses while we were there. Cost is 46 pesos with free parking. The same ticket is good for Kinichna, which id down the left fork of the road about 3 kilometers. Toilets at the ticket booth but no refreshments.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Dzibanche", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/32/e7/df/temple.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Chetumal", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "127249450": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Amazing and Mystical", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g317139-d152770-Reviews-Dzibanche-Chetumal_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/32/e7/df/temple.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We had the opportunity of traveling to Dzibanhe and although, it was a 2 hour ride from our cruise ship it was well worth the travel time. It is truly amazing. You are even able to scale some of the structures there. What I liked the most is was not tourist trampled and congested.  In fact we were the first group ( there were5 of us) that went there in like 8 days. If you like this kind of excursion this is a must see. Our guide was so well versed that on the ride over he had pictures and copies of things to view that really kept our minds working until we go there.

Once a powerful city which flourished from around AD 300-1200, it had trade, political and military links with nearby Kohunlich and rival centers in Southern Campeche and in Guatemala.&quot;\\n\\nThe site itself is huge with 5 substantial structures, many of which you can climb to the top. There are also a few smaller structures for those of us a bit afraid of steep steps. \\n\\nThe highlight for me is that the ruins are carved out of the wooded jungle. The woods offer plenty of shade but be sure to wear long pants and use lots of bug spray. I was not prepared and ended up covered in mosquito bites. \\n\\nYou also have a chance to see wildlife in person. While we were waiting for a member of our group to wander back our way, a man approached us and pointed to where they had seen some howler monkeys. It didn\\'t take long for us to find a group of 8-10 monkeys, including babies, and we stood under the trees and watched them for about 30 minutes before they headed off into the distance. It was the highlight for me of the day. \\n\\nYour admission also includes access to another nearby ruin so you could easily make a day of going to both.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Dzibanche", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/32/e7/df/temple.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Chetumal", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}}
