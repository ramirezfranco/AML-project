It is tricky to find.  Easiest way to access it is by driving from Todos Santos on Highway 19 South back towards Cabo.  If you are going the other direction, you will need to turn around on the outskirts of Todos Santos.  Just past mile marker 57, you will see a nondescript dirt road that is unmarked.  On the East side of the road is an abandoned compound establishment (I didn\\'t see any dead pine tree).  It is the only building within 2 km so you will know that you have the right spot.  If you miss the spot, there is another turn off right at mile marker 58 (not 68 like one of the other reviewer\\'s said).  If you look in the distance to the West, you will see the grove of palm trees in the distance to know that you have the right area.  Both turns off\\'s take you down a sometimes rutted, sometimes smooth dirt road that is 2+ km long.  At the end of the road, a downed palm tree blocks your path from driving further and this is where you park.  There were a half dozen parked cars here.  No broken glass noted, although the lady at the book store in town said to watch out if there was broken glass due to past break ins.  We easily transversed the drive in our rented Jetta, you just need to go slow in the rutted sections.  From there, it is a short walk through the well marked path to the beach.  We found an area that had a ton of shells and my daughter and I picked shells for an hour.  The one caution I have is that you probably need to use bug spray on the lower extremities.  The beach was infested with sand flys (no see ems) and I got eaten alive.  This was pointed out by another reviewer.  The beach is fairly isolated, there were only about 12 people there at mid-day.  No horses seen, just the evidence they left behind.  As for wading, not a problem as the beach had a very shallow incline.  Swimming, I would be very careful.  There was a well worn sign instructing how to swim out of a rip-current, perhaps an ominous warning?

The drive is a bit &quot;exciting&quot; but once you arrive it is well worth it. You follow a winding, rutted road through the desert until you arrive at a small parking lot. We drove a van with seven passengers and actually had some of the people get out to help guide me through the ruts. There were several normal cars in the lot so it is possible to get to it without four wheel drive. Once you leave the parking lot you enter a beautiful palm grove and then see a field of tall grass with remnants of cane and then walk out onto a broad beach. A spring cuts through the trees and enters the ocean. This is a great place for kids to play without worrying about them entering the surf. There are ruins of a home on the edge of the cliffs. We ran into some folks who live in the area and they said the ruins were the remains of a summer home built for the one-time president of Mexico. They also said the land nearby is still owned locally and a care taker opens and shuts the gates each night to keep out partiers who may soil the beach. We had heard that cars a frequently broken into while people visit the beach, but we saw no indication of that during our visit. We had heard that &quot;wild&quot; horses roamed the palm grove and we did have a chance to see them. However, they are pretty well fed and very friendly so I suspect the term &quot;wild&quot; was an exaggeration.

Soon enough, we spotted a little red panga in the distance. The way it was cleverly manipulated to speed all the way to -- and over and onto! -- the beach was just spectacular. We watched as the guys on the beach ran over to help the others in the boat. There were about 6 small sharks caught. They told us that shark meat can be eaten, and proceeded to clean their catch. Soon after, we noticed that there was a little black shining head bobbing in the waves. A seal! We watched as it rode the waves, almost like a real surfer.

If all you can do is come for the hatchling release  at dusk, then do it - it\\'s an emotional experience watching the tiny turtles slowly make their way into the big pounding waves of the Pacific Ocean (just don\\'t use flash when you take pictures)!  \\n\\nBut if you want more, I highly recommend their &quot;Biologist for a Day&quot; program which they offer for a small fee.  I was fortunate enough to be there on a day when two Olive Ridley turtle nests were finishing hatching and they were &quot;excavating&quot; those nests so I got to help, after they showed me a special way to clean my hands.  So this is an opportunity to be hands-on, unlike if you only come for the release.  And if you can be flexible with which hours you help out, and/or which days of that week you can help, that would increase your chances of having a full experience.  The reason is because just like human babies, turtles are born when they\\'re born, not on schedule.  I spent four hours during the day at their &quot;greenhouse&quot; on the beach, checking for newborn turtles digging their way up from the nests and listening to senior volunteers talk with people passing by and giving out information.  They were so enthusiastic and passionate, it was great!  Then I came back later that same day to help dig out any last stragglers that were still making their way up out of the nest along with the eggshells from the nests so we could count and record them all, which was an amazing experience.\\n\\nI was impressed with how much this organization accomplishes with such basic facilities and resources, and how they were careful to put the well-being of the turtles first before the interests of tourists who might be well-meaning but not as educated about what\\'s ok.

We arrived at Tortugueros Las Playitas in Todos Santos, Mexico just before sundown.  (You\\'ll need a car, or at least a ride to the secluded beach).  A green house filled with markers that look like gravestone were numbered- a complete contrast to what these markers actually represent- LIFE.  The members and volunteers of Tortugueros Las Playitas patrol 36 kilometers of beach early each morning (4 am), identify nests of endangered/ threatened species of sea turtle, and relocate the eggs to a temperature controlled green house- dramatically increasing the survival rate of each nest.   Approximately 50-75 days later, depending on the species, the eggs start to hatch.  They hold the hatchlings until sundown, when they will have a significantly better chance of survival against their natural enemies:  coyotes, birds, crabs, fish. \\n\\nBasically, they do the work, and you get to watch the miracle.  After a brief questions/answer period and great photo opportunities, they release the tiny turtles at your feet, and the race is on. This particular evening they released 80 turtles.  It was an amazing and intense experience.  My 11-year old son said, &quot;This is better than Hunger Games!,&quot;  as we watched a crab drag a tiny turtle into its hole.  Fortunately, it was rescued and continued it\\'s trek into the ocean.  The sunset was beautiful, the ocean air was fresh, we could see whales playing off the coast.  All 80 hatchlings made it into the surf; It was a perfect day.  \\n\\nI learned that 9-years ago there were 40 nesting Leatherback (the largest of the sea turtles, up to 8 feet and weighing 2000 lbs); sadly, none have been spotted this year.  The members/volunteers of Tortugueros do an amazing job at minimizing expense, so they can put every penny into saving more turtles.  I saw Francesca, a founding member of the organization, using 9 year old wiggle-wire to complete the green house.  The wire was rusted, brittle and breaking; new wiggle-wire isn\\'t even on her wish list since they have many other needs.

Fran and German are both wonderful and dedicated people who taught me a lot about sea turtles and the project that they have been running for many years. My days were spent at the beach checking on baby Olive Ridley sea turtles, learning about all sea turtles and answering questions about the project and its roll in the conservation of this incredible animal. I worked with other volunteers who were also there to participate in this great project. You don\\'t have to volunteer each day but are encouraged to create a schedule with other volunteers that allows for daytime observation of the greenhouse on the beach and also the turtle release (if any turtles hatched that day) at sunset each night. You can also join Fran or German as they look for nesting adult sea turtles in the early morning hours. There are no guarantees that you will see an adult Olive Ridley or Leatherback but the ride on the beach under the stars or moon is spectacular in its own right. The project also has casitas that they rent out to volunteers for a very reasonable price.They are located in Todos Santos itself (the turtle project is out of town a few kilometers) and allow for easy access to restaurants and coffee shops nearby. The casitas themselves have kitchenettes or share a common kitchen so that you can cook your own meals. There are many grocery stores and organic produce stands nearby as well. As part of their project, they also offer tours ranging from snorkeling and whale watching locally or trips to La Paz to swim with Whale Sharks. If you have a few days  to spend here, I highly recommend that you take part in this project.

How can this not be &quot;sound environmental education&quot;, or even an &quot;ecosystem conservation approach&quot;?\\n\\nAlso, I question whether JPC Neves is a degreed biologist, and I wonder about his academic credentials.  His posting is illogical, and a personal attack, which a true professional would not do.  Why would a committed biologist want to bash an effective and earnest attempt to save our endangered sea turtles?\\n\\nEnna Earth", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Tortugueros Las Playitas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/ad/b2/0c/filename-tortuga-golfina.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Camino a Las Playitas Between Calle Los Mangos & Camino Internacional", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "2300", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "197787055": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "If you believe in &quot;man&quot; helping balance of nature, this is a must!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150777-d3328607-Reviews-Tortugueros_Las_Playitas-Todos_Santos_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/ad/b2/0c/filename-tortuga-golfina.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I have watched and read about all the hurdles our earth\\'s sea turtles have to overcome to survive, only to continue to slip away in numbers, threatening their ultimate success at surviving in &quot;our&quot; world.

The museum is a treat and a nice simple presentation and representation of the history of the Todos Santos town and surrounding areas.  Many of the photo captions are in both spanish and english and are quite amazing that, given the severe lack of funding the museum gets for curation, they even still exist.  They present a great insight into the lives and happenings in the area from the last 2 centuries and thankfully they have the museum to show it off.  Otherwise all that history would be lost to us that weren\\'t there.  Additionally, there are artifacts and other information on pre-historic times which are also quite fascinating.\\n\\nAfter the walk indoors, a path leads you through a beautiful garden that also has a couple of authentic, and obviously very old, aboriginal huts, as they apparently existed during the times of the first inhabitants.  Very intriguing on how that the same materials used then, are still in use today. Especially, in a society that still is lacking in many of the modern features of our everyday lives, which we take for granted.  Such things as electricity and air conditioning!  The walls were made from the same plants as the roofs on houses made today and by allowing airflow through them, you have, Wha-Lah, Air Conditioning!  Other technologies of the time are just as interesting, too.  You have to see them for yourselves.\\n\\nThis is a can\\'t miss self guided tour and will only take as long as you want to see the entire exhibit, but no more than an 30 minutes if you don\\'t want.   And don\\'t forget, right near the front door is a small box and visitor sign-in book to record your visit and to donate funds of your choice to help with the museum upkeep.  They likely receive no government funding and probably have no endowment.  So, they\\'re existence is entirely based on visitor contributions.\\n\\nSo, don\\'t pay attention to all the negative people that have no idea about what a museum is or should be.  Frankly they are so ignorant, they should just not bother coming to this wonderful country ever again. Your comments of it being &quot;old and dusty&quot; are themselves, &quot;Old and Dusty&quot;.   \\n\\nInstead, come and enjoy a nice, quiet, relaxing stroll through this little gem of history.  You\\'ll love it if you do, and regret it if you don\\'t.  Besides, what\\'s your hurry?  It\\'s Mexico after all, not the US.

We were surprised by the picturesque cobblestone streets and original brick buildings that have been turned into art galleries, shops and restaurants. We browsed the stores, visited the Mission church, and lingered at Tequila Sunrise for lunch. The main square had local vendor stalls (not sure if they are there every day). I got some darling hand-made dolls for our girls and dried fruit for snacking. On the drive to Todos Santos, we stopped at Playa Los Cerritos and Punta Lobos (we tried for Palm Beach but turned around). I know that many tours make the trip in half a day. That seems rushed to me. Take your time and visit the beaches too. I\\u2019m sorry we didn\\u2019t plan to spend a night or two in Todos Santos.

What I love most about La Paz ( So.Baja) are the people. La Paz. Cabo, East Cape. Some of the best people I know. Americans can learn a lot from them. In my opinion, the best beaches in Southern Baja are in La Paz. Been to Todos Santos before but never to the beaches. So after a hot July afternoon of shopping some furniture, we did (like many locals) head to the beach when things are  bit cooler...around 5pm). We drove the dirt road to Playa Los Cerritos for the first time. We don\\'t surf..we like scuba diving and fishing and had heard its not a good swimming beach. We found the beach just &quot;ok&quot;. was looking forward to some local food, cooling off, relaxing. Los Cerritos is geared for surfing and boarding. ( we of coarse knew this prior to coming) We set up our umbrella and chairs. My wife went to change and use the banos. The beach club said no. Not even if you buy something. They sent her to the public outhouse. She walked over...it was locked. \\nWith no services I cant see what anyone sees in this beach. Even as a destination to vacation...I dont get it. I think there are MUCH better areas to go in BCS. Im sure we\\'ll go back but very limited. I found it nothing more that an extention of Cabo (even though we\\'re not partyers I like Cabo much much better). We didnt find the people as warm either. Indifferent would be a good word.\\nA possible explaination may be that perhaps ,as a small town, these folks are tired of getting hammered by American tourists gringos. IDK. All I know is that this is a 2 star beach to me. ( 2 stars because the water is always nice \\ud83d\\ude0e)\\nSorry.

Anything you eat or drink is deducted from your $25, so try to keep track of prices so you don\\'t go over your $25 limit. The fee can be paid with a credit card.\\n\\nThe beach is very swimmable at low tide, and during the summer (we were there in August), the waves aren\\'t that big and the water temperature is pleasant.

As someone else suggested, you have an option to go to the Playa Cerritos - Pubic Beach just south of the Beach Club, parking is free and you can just walk about the same distance to the beach.  But not well mark or easy to find. Look at Google Maps. There is a small hotel just south of the public beach that has a nice pool and good food, although pricey.

I made it to the beach on 10 of the 12 days I was in town. \\n\\nAlthough it was Spring Break for some, I never found it crowded. Nor are there crowds of vendors on the beach, if you are not interested, they get the message and leave you alone.\\n\\nWe are fortunate that there are life guards on this beach, and yes they are watching out. I saw them see  a group in a little bit of stress, and they were johnny on the spot.\\n\\nUnlike most beaches in Los Cabos, you can actually swim on this one. Just pay attention to the flags,  they mark the safer area to swim when the current gets a little strong.\\n\\nIf you want to keep budget a little lower, I recommend stopping and picking up some of your refreshments before you hit the beach.  Although I have always had great food and service at the Beach Club it can get pricey. Everything in US dollars and they get 6 bucks for a beer.  Stop at Brody\\'s on the last dirt road to the beach. They are located about half way to the beach.\\n\\nDuring this trip, there were lots of surfers, many giving it a try for the first time. We took advantage of the massages on the beach.  A great experience.  They get about $40.00 US,  A whole lot cheaper than the resorts in Cabo, and a much more unique experience. I had a couple during the trip. Gaby does a great job.\\n\\nThe beach club charges a $5.00 parking fee, unless you spend a few bucks with them.  You can park for free on either side of the beach club for free.\\n\\nThere are several options for surf boards and bogie boards on the beach,  you might want to comparison shop.\\n\\nAnother great benefit of this beach, is that when it gets real hot in Cabo, it is about 10-15 degree F, cooler on this beach.  It makes it real comfortable in the heat of the summer.\\n\\nThere are several options for staying on the beach, or just a quick walk away, I would recommend planning an outing on Cerritos Beach during your next trip.

I have to say I was a little skeptical about the 35-40 minute drive from Cabo San Lucas, however, it was exactly what we were looking for!\\n\\nNow, the one complaint - there is a dirt road to access the beach from the main highway.  It is a bit rough, but it is well worth the trip.  The beach is a long crescent with rock formations on either end.  The sand is super fine.  The surf was excellent for surfing and boogie boarding.  My husband who is an excellent swimmer and my son who was a beginner boogie boarder both had a GREAT time in the water.  You can wade out a long way.  There is some type of restaurant/bar on the beach, but we did not visit it.  There were shower/restroom facilities as well.  \\n\\nThis was a cool beach with many people in RVs and tents - also many families brought their dog along, so there were quite a few dogs playing in the ocean.  \\n\\nOverall, this was the best beach experience we had in Cabo!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa Los Cerritos", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f9/2f/ed/playa-los-cerritos.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "11052884": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Changing Fast", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150777-d153625-Reviews-Playa_Los_Cerritos-Todos_Santos_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f9/2f/ed/playa-los-cerritos.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "For those who like mainstream resorts like those found in Cabo, Waikiki, or Miami, Cerritos is a nice comming attraction.
