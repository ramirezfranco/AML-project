It is warm and humid, but has cooled off mid month. It is a very nice beach, a lot of nights it rains, the water is usually not to rough unless there is a storm. The water is warm and the sand is nice, but it can get hot. Mosquitos can be bad in the evenings. Not too much to see snorkling, a few fish, you can rent a couple of jetskis or sit on kayaks, ride on a banana boat (big tube floatie pulled by a boat). There are a couple of trails in the nearby jungle/hill, which is about 4k to hike across, but parts are a bit overgrown, not a hike for the out of shape. There is a nice lookout about 2k,where you get a nice view of the ocean, another beach on the other side with bigger waves, kissing beach \\'supposedly private\\' near the beginning of the trail, with a \\'bar\\' (shack). Seen a few types of birds and lots of crabs while jogging it. The beach is not too busy during the week, but the weekends it can be packed, mostly from Guadalajara, and in mid November on, a lot of Canadians, I\\'ve been told. There are a few beach bars, most are open weekends, with a couple during the week, I have had a few really good meals, fish grilled over mesquite, coconut shrimp, and a few blah meals as well. Beer for about 20 pesos, but a good margarita, I couldn\\'t find, besides my own. Lots of vendors on the beach \\'get used to it, \\' had some great shrimp and donuts though. Some of the \\'locals\\' leave a mess on the beach, but the businesses send their people out to clean it up every morning. There is very little English spoken on the beach, but you can usually get by. The bathrooms leave a bit to be desired, but not too bad. Nice beach for family\\'s.

But I\\'m not one to spend 4-5 hours in a hot tub, in Mexico.  with Best Tours, Augustine will make a day out of it, and take to you other places after, like his home town of Fortuna.  There you will have a wonderful shrimp meal at a great price.  you can call Agustine at 322-122-6122 or meet him at his booth by Hotel Alegra.  We have used his services for 5 years and have never been disappointed.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Aguas Termales De Nuevo Ixtlan", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/99/e3/e6/beer-20-pesos-camerones.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Alta Vista", "addressLocality": "Rincon de Guayabitos", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "551338519": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Highly overrated ", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g552078-d9710214-Reviews-Aguas_Termales_De_Nuevo_Ixtlan-Rincon_de_Guayabitos_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/99/e3/e6/beer-20-pesos-camerones.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "After reading all the reviews here, we decided to check this out for ourselves.

We found someone near Tonita\\'s 1 beach restaurant, near the Laureles beach walkway. We paid 250 pesos each. Keep in mind that it\\'s an hour time difference from Puerto Vallarta or San Pancho, so we had to wait over an hour before the first boat trip at 10:30 am (other companies might have earlier tours). One of our fellow boat riders got sick within 25 feet of shore, so I had to ask the captain to return (I was nominated translator despite my bad Spanish). We picked up more people while on the beach, a multi-generational group from Mexico, which included a young man who thankfully spoke better English than my Spanish. Then, just as I thought we were heading to the island, Jesus turned us back to shore on a different stretch of beach to pick up a sun shirt. Finally, we started the tour which included a cruise past a protected sea turtle nesting beach and past Crab Island. We really just wanted to go snorkeling, so some of our group got a bit impatient. Finally, around 11:15 we got off at Isla Coral, which was already fairly crowded.  The water wasn\\'t crowded, though, so we explored the reef with snorkel gear we brought with us from Colorado. Clarity was bad in front of the beach, but got better in either direction. It reminded me of snorkeling on the North Shore of Oahu -- more algae than live coral, but we saw trigger fish, pufferfish, spotted box fish, parrotfish, Moorish idols, and a moray eel, and lots of bright blue baby damselfish. The water was fairly warm, too, for late March. You could buy Corona Light from the beach shack for only 25 pesos (bottled water was 20, so it really wasn\\'t a difficult decision). Someone was selling raw oysters and some sort of snack with salsa on it. There\\'s also a casual restaurant on the island above the dock with a great view. The crowd was primarily families vacationing from other parts of Mexico and we enjoyed people watching on the beach. We stayed about 2 hours.

However, with facets of the trip being completely misrepresented (Kissing Beach, Tortuga Beach, glass-bottomed boat, restaurant semi-existent but not open, etc.) and the weather and tides not cooperating, this trip is a total bust. I\\'d not recommend Isla del Coral to anyone.  Especially poor at the cost of $500pp MX.\\n\\nTL;DR - The details\\u2026\\n\\nRead about this place before heading out for our (now) annual Buceri\\u00e1s trip.  We visited Isla del Coral yesterday, 23 January 2018.\\n\\nEverything I\\'d read prior to visiting had been pretty darn positive.  There were a few negative reviews tucked in there, but they seemed to be a small minority, so I wasn\\'t too concerned.  Whoops.\\n\\nWe were promised a visit to the &quot;Kissing Beach&quot;, a glass bottomed boat with a tour of the smaller island and finally being dropped off as Isla del Coral which boasted snorkeling amongst the corals and fishes, and a small restaurant for cerveza and eats. \\n\\nThe day was overcast that there was some chop to the ocean.  We boarded a very crowded boat over 60-minutes past the designated departure time and upon settling in realized there was no glass bottom-unless you count fiberglass.  The life vests were in questionable state, many showing signs of mildew and without the male end of the clip with which they could be properly secured.  This made them fragrant as well as unsafe.\\n\\nThe &quot;Kissing Beach&quot; we learned is &quot;private&quot; thus it was simply pointed out to us as we passed.  Everything announced while on the boat was in fast Spanish so I\\'ve really no clue as to what was said.  I relied on my wife who speaks Spanish to provide the translation about the Kissing Beach as well as any other proclamations made, of which there were few.  The smaller island which we were promised held lovely views of fish, coral and crab were non-existent as the boat just plowed on by and, with no glass bottom, would have been pointless anyway.  Tortuga Beach?  Uh, did we miss something?  Apparently as there was zero reference to it at all as we continued on.\\n\\nWe were soon deposited on the small dock on Isla del Coral with questionable snorkeling gear and walked over to the beach.  For a national natural reserve, it is a disgrace.  Overall, it feels in a state of disrepair and while there are many signs reminding not to litter, garbage abounds.  The tables, chairs and umbrellas are all worse for wear.  Crossing by to the beach one passes a rental hut and the path up to the restaurant.  It smelled like a septic field.\\n\\nOnce one finally gets to the beach, it is very small.  This will be exacerbated by the tides.  It is very clear at this point that, in order to enjoy any snorkeling or time on the beach, you will need to ensure the seas are very calm and you go at low tide.  Sadly, for us, we hit neither.  The tide was high and the chop we experienced on the mainland carried over to the island making the turbidity quite great and navigating through the coral for an attempt at snorkeling perilous.  \\n\\nThe amount of exposed beach was minimal due to the tides and occasional waves almost reached the walls of the island.  We also noted that even had the tide been farther out, there is more rock covering portions of the beach than pictures previous of the beach seen online indicated.  Combined together, there wasn\\'t much sandy beach to be had.\\n\\nYou\\'ll need to keep possessions on your person or find a ledge on the island\\'s rock walls to place your stuff.  As per another review, many of these rock walls are white with guano so careful what you touch or where you place your bags.  Should you find a nice ledge sans poop on which to place your belongings, be careful should you use bare hands to brush off some of the dead leaves and other detritus.  There are small ants in there with a very nice bite. Ouch!\\n\\nAfter 40-50 minutes analyzing the situation and positioning our belongings, we gave up and decided to retire to the restaurant and have a few beers while waiting for the return boat as there was nothing else to do.  We hiked past the decrepit tables and chairs for rent and up the path to the restaurant to discover that it was locked up and closed.  While there did appear signs that it is still in use, at least occasionally, there were no hours of operations posted.\\n\\nReturning down the path to the rental hut, we found that they sell snacks and beverages, including beer.  Corona Light in a can is the sole option and $25 MX.  We purchased our beer and trodded back to the restaurant to await the boat that would return us to the mainland.  Half-way through our beers, we saw the boat approach and scurried down to the dock to hop aboard, happy not to have to wait any longer in this place.  \\n\\nAt the dock, people were dis-embarking after an uneventful trip whale watching and we were initially told we would need to wait another hour on the island to return.  Thankfully, my wife can be pretty convincing and with her grasp of the Spanish language was able to get us onto the boat and mainland bound.  We had a good laugh on the boat about our (mis-) adventure while the boat pilot blasted local tunes over the speaker system.\\n\\nWe soon hit the mainland, left the boat and, after a long walk on the beach, grabbed better beer, tacos and settled into the car to return to Buceri\\u00e1s.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "1"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Isla de Coral", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/12/b1/f9/isla-de-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Rincon de Guayabitos", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "554650270": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Great Fun", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g552078-d10720980-Reviews-Isla_de_Coral-Rincon_de_Guayabitos_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/12/b1/f9/isla-de-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Had an amazing time at Isla de coral.

However, I did see a Mexican tourist ask for a snorkel and mask at the last minute and the &quot;Spanish only speaking boat skipper&quot; got the man a set for a fraction of the price we paid.  The trip included a quick fly by the next two beach areas before a swing by the smaller island to view the bird life and a quick peek through the glass bottom of the boat.
