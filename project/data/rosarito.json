Stalls were set up from which vendors sold local foods and crafts. Another time there was a death metal concert. I think the band was called Iron Head... I know that music is not for everyone but for me, at the time, was really cathartic... You might have to really ask around or look at flyers to know when events are going to happen. Every time I find myself at an event there, it\\'s because I heard music from the boulevard!\\nIn general, it seems the young teens like to hang out around the grounds, but I never found any of them to be \\'up to no good.\\' Go there to contemplate history, read a book or walk your dog.

It seems to have gotten more popular overall as time has gone by. Usually for the most part, I\\'ve seen it super busy during spring break and summers, but it looks like tourism is thriving again. I am definitely glad to see that. As you start walking down towards the beach, you will start seeing a lot of vendors trying to sell you things, from bracelets to the local night clubs, to hats and decorative items.

Hours kinda nervous since we had heard all of the commotion in the past of the murders, drug deals, and other crazy events. However needless to say it has changed for the best. We went down to Puerto Nuevo to have lobster through the toll road and it was clear and cleaned. Puerto Nuevo has many new restaurants and if you get there after 10 a.m. good luck finding parking. We went to this one place we had been there before and we requested for them to have music for us and right away they brought out the portable speaker and treated us like royalty. The place Chela\\'s was great and the staff was on top of their game serving us. We walked around the little town and everybody was eager to serve us and even just looking people are still friendly. On the way back from Puerto Nuevo we went to Rosarito Beach and this is where I must say has changed dramatically in a good way. There are many small tables and a few stages where live bands perform and the DJ plays while the bands are on break. Papas and Beer was still there however not as packed as it used to be before period everybody was at the beach on their own table being taking care of by the many Waiters throughout the restaurant area. A bucket of beer was only $25 and the new beer that they were serving (Indio) I must say is very delicious. We order the fish tacos and the shrimp tacos and they did not disappoint. Walk through town at the small shops and was able to get a few Cuban cigars which were pretty reasonable and that tequila shots that they were giving you a almond tequila awesome. The place seems very clean the new thing down in Baja is the michelada beer as Clamato was being promoted everywhere. Came back to TJ and the place has changed as well with a new area of trendy restaurants and bars which has attracted a lot of new and young crowd. Overall this trip was great even if it was just for the day. Next time I\\'ll plan on going will be for the weekend that\\'s for sure. As an FYI unfortunately we were stuck in a shift change and to cross over the Border it took us 3 hours. Which was not bad as we were able to take turns getting off the car and looking around at the small shops to the side of the line. Overall I highly recommend to go now as you will see many military people and a lot of new places to eat. The new happening place which is before Rosarito and after what the level where they filmed Titanic has now become a popular place with small shops and many other restaurants that are serving Lobster at a great deal. Will definitely go back again really soon.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Rosarito Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/aa/42/f7/view-from-rosarito-pier.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Rosarito", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "394052901": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Just like U.S. but friendlier and cheaper", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150774-d156123-Reviews-Rosarito_Beach-Rosarito_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/aa/42/f7/view-from-rosarito-pier.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Rosarito beach is a great family getaway spot, it\\'s kept clean and patrolled by local (Bomberos) firemen for safety, there is also a security  force present for beachgoers.

It is wide and long with white sand and is free for all to use. Locals come here to cool off. The water temps are a tad cool by San Diego standards. When it is 70\\' in San Diego, it is usually 65\\' in Rosarito. That is because of a different current that touches the shore. You can book a horse to ride on the beach, play &quot;football&quot; (soccer), or just hang out in the sun. I\\'m not sure if beer or wine is legal on the beach so don\\'t flaunt it if you bring it. I do see others drinking, which means nothing in Mexico. One could always go to The Rosarito Beach Hotel, where the pier comes out on the beach, and get served there. Don\\'t miss sundown as you will be rewarded with a lovely sight! If you want to surf fish, make sure that you are away from swimmers. There are plenty of sand-crabs in the sand to use for bait.

Surfing is awesome as well as sea kayaking, rock climbing, bicycling and having a picnic on the beach with some amazing tacos from one of the nearby taco stands.\\n\\nThe downtown area has made some improvements and is starting to look a little more like a real tourist town but if you drive even a block off of the main road you will be in gang infested neighbourhoods full of gang graffiti and all the negative things that go with that such as drugs, violence and prostitution. There are very few street signs making it difficult to get around and the stop signs are small and sometimes in the middle or the road or to one side and can be obscured by bushes etc. Many of the traffic lights do not work so be very very careful. Also be very careful not to hit the kids who stand in the street begging for donations for Red Cross and other non-profit groups. \\n\\nThere are still a lot of problems with the emergency response services so if you need to get to a hospital have someone take you.  The police force is improving but still has some problems with corruption.  Tourist police do not speak english well and neither do emergency operators. 078 tourist assistance line is still not functioning from Movistar phones or from most US cell phones.  To report corruption or other problems you are supposed to call 072 which also does not work from Movistar or US cell phones and no alternate number or online reporting system is in place.\\n\\nTaxis can be a bit scary to ride in and unfortunately they do not meet you at the border when you walk across and finding the Rosarito Group Taxis in Tijuana is quite difficult. Service in general in restaurants and hotels is poor but food is good. You will most likely need to flag down a waiter to get drinks refilled, ask for your bill etcn and there is a 16% tax plus you still need to tip.. That said the food is occasionally amazing and reasonably priced.  Bring only small bills as it is difficult to change anything higher than a 20 but the good news is most places take US Dollars.  \\n\\nYou can expect to see lots of barbed wire and fenced in areas that are very off-putting but necessary due to the security issues in Rosarito. Most hotels and condo complexes are gated with security for a reason. Deportees and homeless people and drug addicts will often ask for money on the steets. Hardworking vendors will approach you often trying to sell anything they have to offer. Be patient with them. They are trying to make a living and may literally be hungry. Children who should be in school can also often be seen trying to sell items to tourists, fixing potholes for pennies and performing on the streets which may upset you but consider the fact that schools run in two shifts so they may go later in the day. Consider buying a little something even if you don\\'t need anything. Rosaritenses are hard working people and they depend on tourism dollars for their next meal.\\n\\nOne of the best things about Rosarito is the festivals they host which are vibrant and exciting as well as the cultural performances hosted by the city and state cultural institutions. Baja Sand held the last week in August is amazing and there are dozens of other festivals from blues to jazz to internationally acclaimed dance festivals. Unfortunately Rosarito does not have an online community portal so it is very difficult to get a clear idea of the events and activities in the area.\\n\\nTo thrive as a tourist town Rosarito should consider doing the following:\\n1. Paint over all gang graffiti within 48 hours both in the main town and on the cuota.\\n2. Improve emergency response systems and correct tourist assistance line and train all police in cpr/first aid and emergency response as well as english.\\n3. Create an online reporting system where tourists can anonymously report their experiences or formally make a complaint as 072 is useless.\\n4. Improve service in restaurants and hotels by training staff in customer service\\n5. Add street signs, number lifeguard stands and beaches, number exits, standardize stop signs and make them larger, fix traffic lights and do not let child volunteers for the Red Cross or other groups stand on the street asking for donations. It is dangerous.\\n6. Lower the volume. Music on the beach coming from clubs often has curse words and promotes violence and is inappropriate for families especially on a Sunday afternoon.\\n7. Shut down all strip clubs anywhere in the city limitsbut especially on Popotla Boulevard which is the artisan district. What an embarrassment those clubs are and they bring violence, drugs, and prostitution which is NOT appropriate for a tourist town.\\n8. Partner with private individuals to create and maintain a proper online community portal where anyone can add an event to the calendar and KEEP IT CURRENT.\\n9. Venues should work much harder to promote their guest artists utilizng social media and all marketing materials should have maps with them.\\n\\nRosarito has a lot of natural beauty which is obscured by gang graffiti, unresolved security issues, corruption and filth. Some things I enjoy in Rosarito are the live performers, sandy beaches, fish markets, street markets, seals, sea lions and horses on the beaches and seeing dolphins and whales in their natural habitat. Rosarito has hundreds of talented musicians, dancers, poets, performers, artists, craftsmen, chefs, and amazing food and they would be smart to capitalize on the incredible amount of creative individuals and beautiful beaches.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Rosarito Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/aa/42/f7/view-from-rosarito-pier.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Rosarito", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "270421467": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nice Beach but nothing special", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150774-d156123-Reviews-Rosarito_Beach-Rosarito_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/aa/42/f7/view-from-rosarito-pier.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is a busy beach with many vendors offering food (coconut filled with shrimps is very popular) and drinks.

It is a toll road so be prepared beforehand with some pesos or $2.35 US dollars.It is literally a 50 minute drive from downtown San Diego. More convenient  this cannot get!\\n\\nThe hotel of choice is the ROSARITO BEACH HOTEL where the new PACIFICO tower is excellently maintained, offering luxury and modern suites at reasonable prices. Every room has an ocean view, the sunsets are mesmerizing. The pool is lovely and lively. Be sure to relax and get into your zen zone at the CASA PLAYA SPA. Oh!! and the hotel restaurant offers QUITE the buffet on the weekends!!!\\n\\nThere are tons of activities offered including but not limited to RV\\'ing on the beach, and horseback riding which is  a mere $10 per half hour. \\n\\nNot much for the club scene? NO WORRIES! , the hotel offers Karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights. There are also delicious places nearby to grab a nice, quiet dinner, like, Bistro Le Cousteau. Guest chef Christian Gritti made a marvelous Italian dinner during this locations ITALIAN RESTAURANT WEEK.\\n\\nIf a romantic dinner is not what you are feeling, well there is a street taco shop right at the entrance of The Rosarito hotel. $1.50 tacos and cerveza hit the spot! The owner was a real doll with passion for his craft and a great sense of humor!\\n\\nLooking for some LOBSTA\\'?! A quick $30.00 cab ride takes you door to door to a Puerto Nuevo restaurant of your liking AND the driver waits for  you while you relax and indulge.  Word to the wise DO NOT let the desperate attempts of other restaurant waiters lure you elsewhere! Really there are 2 GREAT well-known spots to check out CASA DE LANGOSTA and VILLA ORTEGA\\'S.

It was mesmerizing.\\n \\nMy least favorite thing about the beach here is the fireworks. They are incessant during the summer. The displays put on by the Rosarito Beach Hotel are pretty, but the loud bomb type (m-80s, etc) firecrackers drive my dog crazy, and the summer renters set them off every weekend. \\n\\nThe weather is perfect- warm but not hot during the day, and cool at night. \\nThe mosquitoes just south of the Rosarito Beach Hotel are much too plentiful, but I suspect the proximity to a water treatment area is the culprit. \\nI plan to return to Rosarito Beach next summer, but will look for a house on a quiet cove. \\nIn all, as a single, female ex-pat, I feel safe here.

An older man in his 40\\'s ran up to our car as we were leaving and started hitting car, yelled we were on private property and needed to pay. (He was not an attendant and was waiting near a truck with a bum girl we saw down on the beach)  He had his hand in his pocket like he had something he was going to whip out. My boyfriend closed the window and the man punched the window and almost broke it. My bf then opened the window to talk to the man and he kept hand his pocket like he had something in it to hurt us with and tried to come in vehicle, so my bf tried to drive off.

Wandering around the bar district in Tijuana after dark might not be a good idea, but I might not do that in most US cities either.\\n   The area of Baja in and around Rosarito is accommodating to tourists. Outside of Rosarito it is semi-rural, interspersed with nice hotels and houses for rent. \\n   It helps to shop and reserve before you go on &quot;vacation rentals by owner&quot; when traveling to Rosarito in Baja California, Mexico. You can read descriptions and see pictures of where you might be staying. You deal directly with the owner to reserve a place.\\n    San Antonio del Mar is a secure gated beach community two exits before Rosarito Beach that is perfect for a first time visitor to Mexico.  Lots of luxurious homes set on cobblestone roads, with Mexican tile, expansive living space, and spectacular views for less than the cost of a luxury hotel room in the same area.  \\n   The community has its own exit off highway 1, with a 24/7 guard at the entry gate. Centrally located is a community pool and tennis courts. At the entrance is an meticulously manicured tropical park, a wine bar and a breakfast/lunch cafe (Cafe Conrado) that will deliver to your house if prearranged.  The cafe\\'s pies and muffins are delish. Very attentive and polite service. \\n    Many people, American and Mexican, live in San Antonio del Mar year round. Other owners vacation there and rent out their homes the rest of the year.\\n   Renting a house means a place to cook your own dinner, walk undisturbed on an uncrowded beach looking for sand dollars (LOTS at low tide) and see gorgeous sunsets over the Coronado Islands. \\n    If you stay at a Rosarito hotel, your beach walks will be interrupted by multiple vendors selling beach wear and jewelry and your dining experiences may be limited on certain days of the week (many restaurants were closed on Tuesday).\\n  For first time visitors to Mexico who might be worried about navigating the roads or finding places to buy food or dine out , this is a way to enjoy all the natural beauty of Baja with none of the hassle.  \\n        \\n  We brought a cooler with food, drinks, snacks, our own water, and of course lots of beer, wine and tequila. For the first few days, we just wanted to relax.  No one really wanted to make a tiresome and possibly long and confusing trek into town without knowing where to buy things. Later on in the week we could go on little excursions or out to eat.\\n\\n  Fortunately if you have to go out for little things, there is &quot;OXXO&quot;  the Baja version of 7-11. Gas, coffee, bottled water, snacks and some general household supplies are available there. There seems to be at least an OXXO on every third block in Rosarito. They all take, and give change in, US currency. No shortage of gas stations there, with people to pump your gas and clean your windshield--a nice surprise. \\n  Wal-Mart was two exits away from our little beach community -- but a little different than those in the US. Not as well lit, kind of shadowy, but set up like a typical store with groceries on the left and clothes, etc on the right. \\n They sell wine, beer and liquor, strategically placed in the center of aisles near the food. It was kind of bewildering looking for things. It\\'s all in Spanish ! Study your dictionary before going !\\n  Lines at certain times of the day are long, and no one seems to be in a hurry. Makes a case for bringing your own charcoal and lighter fluid, something that is probably there but which I could not find.\\n   Bailey\\'s cream liqueur for coffee was $13 a bottle. I managed to find that. Lots of fresh and delicious local vegetables and fruits too. Watermelon especially wonderful. Lovely complex Baja cabernets available for good prices.\\n   At San Antonio del Mar we rented a three bedroom, three bath home with a two car garage, washer/dryer, satellite TV, wireless, with multiple upper and lower decks right on the ocean for $150 a night. Split between five people, you can see what a deal this is.  A fire pit on the lower deck for a driftwood fire. A BBQ grill for dinner. Tables for outdoor dining.\\n  Early risers can see dolphins, pelicans and sea lions close enough to shore to get photos. Dogs welcome on the beach and in many of the rentals. At low tide the beach is wide and flat. Surfers can find a few shape-y waves when the tide is pushing in on the sand bar or travel two miles to the south to Baja Malibu for bigger waves.\\n   Our first experience at San Antonio del Mar was a one-bedroom condo with a kitchen, nice living area and luxurious bed, perched high up on the cliffs. A pretty significant number of stairs down to the condo from the parking area and also down to the beach, not for people with bad knees. We had the beach all to ourselves and it felt remote and very private, with a high view off the sunny deck. That one was $75 per night--we felt like we couldn\\'t go wrong for that price and got lots of exercise going up and down the stairs to the beach.\\n  There are many other communities up and down the Baja peninsula on either side of the town of Rosarito yet to be explored , but San Antoinio del Mar was a great place to start !", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Rosarito Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/aa/42/f7/view-from-rosarito-pier.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Rosarito", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "182646509": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nice beach but horses ruin it", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150774-d156123-Reviews-Rosarito_Beach-Rosarito_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/aa/42/f7/view-from-rosarito-pier.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Rosarito beach is lovely, but the horses ruin it.

I suggest staying on the main streets and sample a little bit of the local fare from a few different places. These are authentic taco stands and Mexican restaurants. There are few places in the USA that prepare food like here and our favorite place is called Taqueria 2000 which is a about 100 yards off Benito Juarez Bl. on Calle Ensenada, 5 doors down from the Llantera La Mejor on the corner! Here you will find this tiny little taqueria where they grill their meats on a flame and chop it it up on a tree stump -- get the the quesedilla con carne con todos and have enjoy sample of real Mexican food the way it is supposed to taste.
