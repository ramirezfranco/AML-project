There is good surf and little development, except at the north end where they are building endless condo high rises. I have to believe that within 10 years, the developers will come in and put hotels all along this stretch because the beach is so perfect. If they do, this could become the best beach resort in Mexico. The sand is good, the beach is endless, there is consistent surf, and the air and water are warmer in the winter than in Cancun.

We sat on a couple of dilapidated chairs under a torn awning, and a local sold us a couple cans of coke. Every few minutes, some guy would race by on an old ATC wearing a red shirt. We flagged one down and asked him for a ride. He charged 200 pesos (about $15) for 30 minutes. We hopped on and the race began. We flew down the beach, stopping at different public beach areas, including one area where Canadian tourists have been coming for 20 years. They even have Canadian flags on the beach.

The grounds rivaled any tropical botanical gardens we\\'ve visited! The facilities are well-maintained and sparkling clean, staff was terrific and there was no pressure to take sales tour. The pool at the Mayan Palace is truly amazing...so many nooks and crannies to sit, swim and play.  Easy shuttle service to the Grand Mayan to access the beach there, with easy towel service and at this time of the year, there was no problem getting a sheltered tent or hut on the beach. Although the vendors on the beach were numerous ( we counted over 20 different items or services offered), they were never pushy and were always polite. The Cafe de Lago at the Grand Mayan was always a good restaurant choice for breakfast or various themed dinners with live music and a wonderful wait staff. The only down side for us, was that the &quot;studio&quot; we had through our RCI exchange, was really a hotel room...lovely, but without the amenities of a mini-kitchen that we are used to from our other studio exchanges.  These rooms could benefit by having a refrigerator, coffee-maker, microwave and plates/utensils to make the stay easier for those of us that don\\'t want to eat out for every meal.  We did stop at the &quot;Selecto&quot; market on the way to the resort, and because I had read another members review, I knew to purchase a small styrofoam cooler and various food items to get us through some breakfasts, lunches and snack times.\\nWe took a tour of Acapulco..city highlights. It was informative and the view of the harbor from the Chapel of Peace was incredible.

If you are not good with heat and can\\'t climb stairs this is not the tour for you!  The young men and girl that were the divers climbed up the rocks from the water and dove one at a time.  They did identify them so you were ready to see which one jumped.  Kind of Scary and depending on where you stand on the levels and stairs you could miss the water entry as they dive etc.  The heat and the time of day were not good for us...almost 38 degree C.  When we discovered that the fort we had next on the tour was back at the ship and involved a hike up and could have gone ourselves off the boat we just returned to the boat.  So I only rated this average because the cost was a lot!  We could have had access to the fort and had gone earlier on our own...so might want to do that but make sure you get a Taxi that is licensed and the guide takes you to the taxi and the driver meets you and understand how long and how much.\\nSecurity everywhere with Tourist Police, Federal Military and regular police so doesn\\'t make you feel very comfortable and worry if you should even leave the ship!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "El Fuerte de San Diego", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/b3/63/72/photo1jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Hornitos s/n Colonia Centro", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39300", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "480730197": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Interesting History of Acapulco", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d152860-Reviews-El_Fuerte_de_San_Diego-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/b3/63/72/photo1jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The museum has their displays translated into English, so you can go and read about the history of Acapulco especially relating to the relationship with the East.

There are some well-done informative exhibits on early inhabitants, Spanish sailors, trade routes, trade items, Pirates and Fort life/supplies.

The captain was funny, but he only spoke Spanish. We went because we wanted to snorkel, but were disappointed. You need to go beyond the rocks to see a bit of marine life. There is a guide with you, but the actual snorkel time is very short. We also paid for the banana boats, which was not expensive, but the ride was too short, as well. If you want a table, you need to buy food/drinks, and you will pay extra for the umbrella. The pina coladas were terrible.

The place is beautiful, but we were not able to snorkel which was the main purpose of our visit and we quickly left due to there being just too many people. We did get to see some beautiful fish through the glass floor on the boat we used to get to the island. And the people,the workers, as is common in Mexico, were very nice. Tourists on the snorkeling trips were allowed to touch the fish and other wildlife which in my opinion should not be allowed. And I was told by someone who did go on the snorkeling tour that there was little wildlife to see, most likely from too many tourists and the little protection the industry grants the animals. I imagine most of the wildlife have moved away from the island shores.

A great intro for Isla la Roqueta and worth the price - 150 pesos + 35 pesos the hotel that sold me the tickets charged on top. I will write a separate review for Palao.\\n \\nAfter I discovered la Roqueta, I went back 9 times. Instead of getting there via Palao boat, I started going directly to Caleta beach, buying Roqueta Directo for 40 pesos and going straight to the island, skipping the cliff-diving and other attraction spots offered by other boats. \\n\\nMost local tourists go there to hang out on the beach which is wonderful. There are also two smaller beaches that are rather secluded and on business days could be totally empty and feel like your &quot;private&quot; beaches. \\n\\nI loved the hiking trails on la Roqueta. Took me about 3 hours including stops at scenic overlooks to complete a trail variation around the island. If I hang out on one of those private beaches, it would be longer. \\n\\nI never felt threatened by anything - snakes or shady people while on my hikes. I am a 50 year-old woman and most of the times I was on the trails alone. Just gorgeous and perfect for me because it is a well established network of trails, signs are mostly missing but it didn\\'t matter, I just picked the ones that were hugging the shore. Then on other hikes I\\'d go to the Lighthouse and change my trails... \\n\\nSo, if you like to hike, stay on the trails - you\\'ll be in the shade and you might find the beaches on your fist hike - or at least one, and at least one overlook with a breath-taking views... \\n\\nI can\\'t wait to go back.

If you don\\'t speak Spanish, I recommend that you find another option to the island because most tourist guides do not speak English.

We were glad we did it, because it was fun. We were the only Americans on board, so we got a good opportunity to practice our Spanish. The glass-bottom boat circled the harbor, where we viewed the yachts and homes of the rich and famous. \\n\\nWe were wondering how they were going to show us cliff-divers as advertised in their flyer, since it wasn\\u2019t time for the show at La Quebrada. Well, here\\u2019s how: they had a diver who jumped off the boat, swam to shore, climbed up a rock, and dove. We also saw the submarine Virgin, and a diver swam under the boat with food to attract fish. The only part of the tour I didn\\u2019t like was a loooooooooong stop at a lunch boat, just a few hundred feet from La Roqueta, where we had to wait until everyone who wanted lunch was served. I almost went over the side and swam for the island, because I was anxious to get started sightseeing! There is plenty of food on the island, so I don\\u2019t know why everyone had to patronize the lunch boat. You can take as much time as you want on La Roqueta, and come back on any of the company\\u2019s boats throughout the day. \\n\\nLa Roqueta has a beautiful beach, and there were lots of families enjoying the shallow water. We were looking for hiking and snorkel spots, so we started walking. There are numerous trails, all very well maintained. The first sight we encountered was a trio of burros, two of which were shaking down the hikers for snacks. We had read there was a burro who liked to drink Coronas, but we didn\\u2019t have any beer, and anyway we later heard from our local friend Pablo that the \\u201cburro borracho\\u201d was muerte. The burros we met liked trail mix just fine. We gave the rest of our bag to an onlooking boy of 9 or 10, who was thrilled to get to feed the burros. We enjoyed seeing how much fun he found it. \\n\\nWe hiked upwards, aiming for the lighthouse. But near the crest of the island, we had a bit of an adventure. Three large black dogs trotted onto the path and started barking at us. They were wild-looking! Not your generic small tan Hispano-Caribbean street dogs, but big strong dogs with heads that looked like there was some Great Dane in the bloodline, and long whip tails with tufts at the end. It was like a game of Tomb Raider! One was a nursing mother. When we realized they had pups to protect, we lost no time in backing away down the trail, making soothing sounds. We detoured around widely, and never did make it to the lighthouse before we tired of hiking. \\n\\nWe also didn\\u2019t succeed in finding a snorkel spot. We came upon a place where dive boats were anchored, which looked ideal for snorkeling, but the surf was a little too rough and the beach too rocky to make entry safe. Our amigo Pablo later told us that the snorkeling was better at the Camino Real anyway, which I do believe. We did enjoy hiking around the island, taking in the scenic vistas. Next time we visit Acapulco, we will definitely return to Roqueta.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Isla La Roqueta", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/61/ca/f4/isla-la-roqueta.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Playa Caleta Muelle, Caleta", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "5419558": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Take the glass-bottom boat tour, no zoo but excellent food, family atmosphere", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183717-Reviews-Isla_La_Roqueta-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/61/ca/f4/isla-la-roqueta.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We took the glass-bottom boat tour to la Isla de la Roqueta from downtown, near the zocalo- don\\'t remember the name.

Ours had a nice tourguide (tour was in spanish of course), cold mexican beer, and a couple young teenagers that jumped off the boat, swam over to a cliff and climbed up and dove in,  a mini-version of the cliff divers.   Then they swam under the boat corraling fish under the boat so you could see them through the glass bottom.  They even had a little boat that pulled alongside selling fresh ceviche or shrimp in salsa w/avocado - YUM!!! Very fresh and delicious.  Once we arrived on the island we were disappointed that the zoo was closed - I think it is closed for good.  There\\'s not much to do on the island except sit on the beach or rent a ride on those inflatable bananas that they pull behind a boat.  But we enjoyed it because it was very relaxing to just sit back and watch the people.  Be advised - this is a family beach (lots of kids) and most families appeared to be locals.  But the food was EXCELLENT!!.  I\\'m of mexican descent so I know what is authentic and the food was fresh and good.  This is definitely no frills - plastic chairs and tables but there are waiters that are attentive and quick and I don\\'t think there\\'s much of a selection but the freshly caught sauteed shrimp in the shell (still had legs &amp; head!) in garlic w/rice with the fruit and cucumbers on a stick we bought from vendors made for an authentic and relaxing experience.

Got great info and advise from the Acapulco Trip Advisor Forum. Since I was going solo I had some concerns. For anyone that wants to experience a spectacular sunset, take a drive out there. I wanted just to walk the beach and see the sunset, so I left the Costera around 2 pm. You have a choice of taking a private driver, a taxi from your hotel, taking a bus to the Zocalo and then a taxi to Pie de la Cuesta but if you do it my way experiencing the bus ride from the Costera to Pie de la Cuesta it is sooo cheap. \\n\\nThe bus is green and white and says Pie de la Cuesta but you have to make sure that what is written on the windshield says Playa or Playa Luces. It is an old bus and a bumpy ride but only costs 7 pesos. The bus ride is approx. 40 minutes. \\n\\nImagine experiencing a bus ride where the bus driver stops for gas along the way and also near the central market vendors come on the bus selling water, bananas and colorful ices in a round bag with a straw sticking out.\\n\\nI would advise to get off the bus in Pie de la Cuesta at Tres Marias Restaurant so you have a landmark. If you don\\u2019t speak Spanish write on a paper \\u201cTres Marias, por favor\\u201d and show the driver when you get on the bus.\\n\\nThere are two places I am familiar with to pick up the bus. Originally I was told to pick it up on the Costera beach side across the street from Sanborns and Scotia bank (near Zocalo). It no longer stops there as there is the new red Acabus stop at that location. It is now located about 3 blocks behind Sanborns near Woolworths I think on Av Mayo. The location where I took the bus is on the Costera beach side half circle (where different bus pick up) just a few blocks from Parque Papagayo. You will also notice at this location there is a road sign indicating Pie de la Cuesta with an arrow to turn off from the Costero. The street might be called Av Diego Hurtado de Mendoza- Hwy 200 on map. \\n\\nMake sure when leaving Pie de la Cuesta by bus after the sunset you catch the last one by 7pm. The sunset is from 6:15pm to 6:45pm. Surprisingly a disco bus was coming and I said Zocalo and the driver nodded. I took it for 8 pesos. \\n\\nWent on the Sunday which was a holiday week end so the restaurant Tres Marias on Lagoon side and beach side (across street from each other) was packed with people. On the beach there is horse back riding and ATV (4 wheelers or dunebuggys) adult size and smaller ones for kids which are driven on the sand along the beach. It is beautiful to watch the ferocious waves and makes for a beautiful photo. It is very dangerous to go in the ocean here but saw a few taking a chance. Everyone comes on the beach for the sunset otherwise the beach is very quiet and you can walk far with no one around.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa Pie de la Cuesta", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/13/a4/4b/pie-de-la-cuesta.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "441482832": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "What a place to relax fully", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d7715061-Reviews-Playa_Pie_de_la_Cuesta-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/13/a4/4b/pie-de-la-cuesta.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "One of my preferred place to go and return.

We could see the cross from our hotel on Acapulco Bay, and I expected it to be a cross for a church. The guide told us the sad story of the cross, and why it is there, why it is so large. The church and grounds are lovingly tended, immaculate, and respectfully quiet. The architecture of the church is very unique, and I liked that there were no sign of religious symbols. Seeing the tombs and vaults of local families was interesting. The views from the grounds are incredible, as well.

You can go on the tours provided by your travel group or you can find a private driver that will take you to all the histortial places and into local areas like we did. We used an English speaking guide by the name of Jose. Jose stayed by our side at all times and spoke for us to the local people when needed. He took us to the Chaoel of Peace and explained the history and stories of the Chapel of Peace. The view from the Chapel is breath taking. It over looks the Acapulco Bay and if you lucky, you may see a Whale in the Bay. This is a must visit location in Acapulco. Also, when you hire a private driver that you pay by the hour, the cost of visiting tourist attractions are half the cost of what is being charged by the travel tours like Sunwing. This visit to the Chapel was free of cost but you can make a donation on the way out. The cost of going to see the divers which is a must as well, was thirty seven USD each from Sunwing and we paid only ten each which also included a free driink of your choice. Pop, Beer or a poured drink. There is no cost for your private guide to enter the show with you.

If in Acapulco any other day, visit Capilla de la Paz.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Capilla de la Paz (Chapel of Peace)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/73/45/01/the-chapel-of-peace.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle de la Paz, s/n Fraccionamiento Las Brisas", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39979", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "566758352": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A nice stop with a great view", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183711-Reviews-Capilla_de_la_Paz_Chapel_of_Peace-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/73/45/01/the-chapel-of-peace.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We enjoyed this stop...with steps and several columbarium rooms with a step down, I suggest using Nordic poles or walking poles for safety.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Capilla de la Paz (Chapel of Peace)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/73/45/01/the-chapel-of-peace.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle de la Paz, s/n Fraccionamiento Las Brisas", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39979", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "566507794": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Serene &amp; Beautiful", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183711-Reviews-Capilla_de_la_Paz_Chapel_of_Peace-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/73/45/01/the-chapel-of-peace.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The chapel provides an incredible view of Acapulco and the bay.

A single family Carlos Trouyet and his wife Millly build this beautiful memorial in memory of two of  their sons Carlos and Jogre who died in a plane crash in 1967.

It is a very beautiful and peaceful place to visit! The gardens, the Chapel, the monument of The Hands of Brotherhood and especially the Cross are all very beautiful. Also the view of the bay from the lookout point up there is probably the best view that you will find! \\nThat, plus the history of the Chapel are some of the many reasons why we have always visited the Chapel when we are in Acapulco! \\nThe last time that we visited the Chapel was in 2014. The reason didn\\'t visit the Chapel in 2015 and 2016 is because they stopped turning on the lights of the Cross and that is a matter of principle for me and so many other visitors that come here to visit this site.\\nA big part of the history of this Chapel is that the lights of the Cross have always been on from the day that the construction was completed back in December 1971 and that the Cross would always be illuminated at night in memory the two sons that died in an Airplane crash and the lights have always been on for about the last 44 years or so! \\nSince the Chapel was not living up to it\\'s expectations to the history of what the Chapel is all about, so many of us stopped visiting and giving donations to the Chapel which by the way, it is not mandatory to donate. \\nMyself and so many others have tried emailing, calling, visiting and even asking the locals to try and help to get the Chapel to turn the Cross lights back on again but the efforts were futile.\\nFinally, on March 18, 2017 at 7:30 pm the Cross was visible again, the lights were finally turned back on!! \\nWe were so excited to see that the tradition of the Cross being lit up at night continued again. \\nAnother amazing fact about the Cross is that it is visible from everywhere along the bay of Acapulco and that\\'s also why it was placed on top of the hill in the \\u201cLas Brisas area. As of yet, we don\\'t know why the lights were turned back on but we are very happy that they are on again and that they will continue to stay on! I would like to give a Big Thank You to whoever is responsible for turning the lights back on and that is why we have returned to visit the Chapel again!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Capilla de la Paz (Chapel of Peace)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/73/45/01/the-chapel-of-peace.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle de la Paz, s/n Fraccionamiento Las Brisas", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39979", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "472239456": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "So Beautiful", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183711-Reviews-Capilla_de_la_Paz_Chapel_of_Peace-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/73/45/01/the-chapel-of-peace.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This chapel is pure genius architecture.

Having Carlos was like having our own personal tour guide.  He gave us fabulous recommendations and took us to this magnificent place.  The view and the overall feeling while being at this Chapel cannot be expressed with words.  I would definitely recommend adding this place to your list of &quot;must sees&quot; in Acapulco.  I would also highly recommend Carlos, as he did everything he could to make our trip that week the best ever. We actually booked our tours with him, more private and definitely was the best ever. He cared and it showed. we felt very comfortable with him and his son we had one day. His wife made us dinner after the men went deep sea fishing.

To get to the chapel property you have to walk up a little hill from where you park; once you enter the chapel property there are a bunch of steps (some short and some tall) to get up to the chapel itself.  For people with limited mobility, I think this would be difficult to visit.  It is not a very difficult, long, or challenging hike, but it is moderate (vs. something that is flat and totally accessible.)  \\n- KIDS: Our daughter (20 months) did fine, but we had to carry her a bunch because she is not good enough with stairs yet. We also had to be careful about the fences, because they were not child-proof fences, but it wasn\\'t a problem for us.  \\n- COST: I didn\\'t see anyone charge us anything to visit, although there was a donation box at the entrance.\\n- SITE INFORMATION: I did not see any placards or signs with information about the history, and it was far more interesting with the background story, so we were happy to be there with our guide.

First and foremost, this is one of the MUST SEEs of Acapulco. My family and I were fortunate to see the Capilla De La Paz as a part of the Acapulco Highlights Tour offered by Acapulco for All (Sebastian Hernandez, proprietor). Trust and believe, while the church and the surrounding areas are beautiful to see, nothing helps you understand its significance--history, location, construction--like having the right person explain it to you. Sebastain did a fantastic job detailing how the church came to be located, the family behind its construction, and the materials used to construct the church. Sebastian came HIGHLY recommended and I would recommend that ANYONE who wants to visit the church and understand more about it, use Acapulco For All! Don\\'t just go and see a beautiful site, UNDERSTAND why the site exists and what it means to the community it serves. It will immensely improve your appreciation of the church and the surrounding grounds.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Capilla de la Paz (Chapel of Peace)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/73/45/01/the-chapel-of-peace.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle de la Paz, s/n Fraccionamiento Las Brisas", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39979", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "155532856": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Great views of the bay but not much else", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183711-Reviews-Capilla_de_la_Paz_Chapel_of_Peace-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/73/45/01/the-chapel-of-peace.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The chapel is a simple structure with great views of Acapulco but overall not much to see or do here.

The non-denominational chapel is located in the very pricey Las Brisas area of Acapulco. The chapel itself is small but very quaint and charming. It has beautiful marble facades which allow lovely opaque light to shine upon the chapel interior during the day. The cross is massive (at over 130 feet in height) and overlooks Acapulco bay. At night it is lit up atop the mountain.  Next to the cross there is also a smaller statue called Las Manos de la Hermandad, of two right hands joining together signifying brotherhood. \\n\\nMy suggestion is to try and visit this site on an early/small tour group. We visited on Tuesday morning around 10:30am with a group of only 7 people. We had the site to ourselves for most of the short tour, which was nice considering the small size of the grounds. As we were leaving we saw a few large tour groups arrive and I had a hard time imaging how they were all able to comfortably tour the small site.  I would highly recommend this site to anyone visiting Acapulco who is interested in seeing more of the unique charm of the city itself. The view from the top of the chapel atrium is worth the trip alone. Acapulco bay is breathtaking from this vantage point!

We came from across town to see the show and were not disappointed!\\n\\nAdmission for the balcony (non-hotel) that the divers actually enter from is only 40 pesos, not expensive at all. You buy a ticket and enter, immediately surrendering your ticket. Then there is a slight trek down a good number of stone stair cases to the platform. Some of the sections of stairs are steep or uneven, watch where you are stepping! This is a beautiful place to take pictures, especially at sunset!\\n\\nWhen the show begins, there is epic music and the divers come down the same staircase you entered from with torches in their hands. They climb down the wall you\\'re standing at, jump in the water, and climb up the huge cliff on the other side. Once all of the divers are there, they take turns diving. Some dive backwards, some in tandem from different heights, some do somersaults. They are all amazing! If you go after dark, I think it\\'s the 10:30pm show, they dive with the torches in their hands!\\n\\nRegardless of what time you go, be sure to find a spot to stand early and stand your ground there carefully. People will try to push their way around you, I was stepped on by a local who thought I would move because I\\'m a little white girl. I\\'ll say again, be careful.\\n\\nAfter the show the divers have a bag for tips and they stand on the stairs as you exit by them. Some of them are available for photos there if you want one.\\n\\nThere are food vendors and souvenir shops near the entrance and throughout the parking lot if you get hungry or thirsty. There is even a table where you can pick a shell or plate and have it painted with a scene of the divers right there in front of you. We waited 10 minutes for one of these and only paid about 3 USD for it. They wrap your item in plastic wrap so it can continue drying and then again in another plastic bag so you can carry it.\\n\\nThere is also a public bathroom right by the ticket counter, but just like any other public bathroom in that area, there is no toilet paper, and there is a lady sitting outside the bathroom who will ask you for 5 pesos in exchange for a good handful of it. I personally always carry wipes in my bag and do not pay to use the restroom, but they will totally give you dirty looks and talk about you if you tell them no.

While they are cooking your food, you jump on a pontoon boat and go with Felix to tour the lagoon and the many narrow passage ways.. this slow tour to look at the birds (flamingos, cranes, storks, grey herrons, tri colored herron, and many more) was extremely relaxing.. And the perfect way to end the day is to go to Los Bou Bous to have an amazing fish and shrimp dinner. Felix\\'s wife cooked amazing fish, and then a dozen shrimp couked a couple of ways..

They have added many new trees, shrubs, lights, pedestrian crosswalks, sidewalks, new grass, sculptures a new monument and more! In front of the Convention Center they also added a new pedestrian crosswalk that is wheelchair accessible and it is so much easier to cross the Costera! Our favourite addition is the new Monument that they just finished put up in the last week of March and it is located next to Commercial Mexican in Costa Azul area. This Monument stands very tall and in the night time it is beautifully lit up with many lights that keep changing colour! They also planted new trees and shrubs here and they also have lights shining on them. You can see that the locals are very proud of this new Monument  because they are taking lots of photos and videos of this new site and everyone likes the new benches that were installed here as well. As we continue down the Costera we also noticed that there are new Oxxo\\'s, bars, restaurants, stores, souvenir shops and more new additionsalong the way. The Costera in La Diana area is the place to be if you like none stop action, bars, clubs, restaurants, movie theaters, shopping malls and people watching!

The food was fresh and delicious for all budgets etc. Now it is such a dump. Thank you Mex government for letting the cartel take over your country and lossing tourists making your happy people with no way to earn a living. Now, I am exploring wonderful Colombia.

I recommend you arrive by taxi where you want to go, and maybe walk a little afterwards to get a sense of wheather you like it or not.

Our Expedia contact in Acapulco advised us to be there one hour before but it really is not necessary!  \\n\\nAfter checking in and presenting our vouchers at the entrace to the park, were given tickets to the dolphins and wondered around to pass the time.  Quite honestly this park has seen better days, rather grotty and it was awfully crowded!  The kids looked like they were having a great time though ... \\n\\nWhen it was time to meet the dolphins were were shown into an enclosed pool area with quite a large bunch of people but it turned out most were parents of kids who were taking part.  There were 10 in our group altogether including young children.  We were asked to take a quick shower beforehand (to remove any oils or sunblock residues which harm the dolphins) and for this reason I left my T-shirt on - 1 hour in the water without sunscreen is not a great idea even so late in the afternoon.  Still, I was willing to get a red nose for the chance to kiss a dolphin!  We doned our life jackets (compulsory) and got into the salty pool.\\n\\nWe met 4 dolphins altogether in 2 adjacent pools and it was one of the best hours of my life!  The instructor/handler spoke mainly in Spanish and gave us a quick summary in English ... as a result we were clueless most of the time.  We took care not to harm the creatures and just copied what everyone else did.  We fed them, we sang to them while they danced around, they sang to us and we kissed them (taste kind of fishy!), stroked them, got pushed and pulled along, jumped over, splashed silly ... it was hilarious.  The dolphins were charming, chattering away and squeaking delightfully while they played with us.  The little kids in our group were helped by one of the handlers in the water and they loved it I am sure!  \\n\\nA video was taken by one of the crew and stills were on offer to purchase after the swim.  An actuall DVD was not available and the photos were to be printed and collected at a later date.  Even though @ US$8.00 each they were reasonable, we had enough pics of our own and opted out.   Here you are permitted to take your own photos/video at no additional cost.  We asked one of the &quot;parents&quot; to take a few with our camera and they came out really great!  Thanks Andy!!!\\n\\nI recommend this dolphin swim if you have never done it before, and are happy in a salt water pool.  You don\\'t need to be fit!  The water park is right down town and spending an hour with these beautiful creatures is the nicest way to end a day!\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "CiCi Acapulco Magico", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/16/4a/07/cici-water-park-dolphins.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Costera Miguel Aleman S/N Esq.

In order to fight against this disease, \\u201ca doctor called Francisco Javier Balmis, proposed that with a weapon they throw a considerable part of the mountain so it creates a way to the fresh air to flow and let the disease goes away from the mountain and the heat too\\u201d (M\\u00e8xico desconocido, 2018). The first shot to create it was in 1799 and it immediately worked for the purpose it was created; they called it \\u201cEl Abra de San Nicol\\u00e1s\\u201d.\\nThey noticed that it worked for the purpose of the fresh air come but the smells of persons or animals who were dead or sick didn\\u2019t go like the disease, so in 1876 Jos\\u00e9 Mar\\u00eda Lopetegui with dynamite and human effort, they opened a gap of 300 meters and was called with the name of \\u201cLa Quebrada\\u201d. Since that moment, \\u201cLa Quebrada\\u201d has been one of the most iconic places of Acapulco.\\n \\nNow we will talk about why it should be considered and recognized over the other touristic places that we can found in Acapulco. The tourism of Acapulco is at the order of the day and is the principal economic income of the area. Another reason of why is do visite is that is the headquarter of the diving world championship, which is a fact that not everybody knows. As everybody knows M\\u00e9xico is a third world country, thing that should be another reason to visit no just this  touristic area, but visit other areas, if you travel all over the country you\\u2019ll improve the mexican economy. \\n\\nAcapulco has lots of beautiful beaches, those are perfect for doing any aquatic sport, or just to relax and rest in that beautiful landscape, there also exist many diverse options for the ones that want to know the other side of the city\\u2019s, in this case Acapulco, since this is not the exception of the kind of city that has an unknown side. This city was founded in 1550, the pre-Columbian era, which means that there are some touristic places where you can find a historical undertone; and La Quebrada de Acapulco is not the exception to that rule since its creation was decided thanks a historical event.\\nSo, in Acapulco, there are many different and fun touristic activities and that cannot be discussed, but there is no any interesting point like La Quebrada since it has one of the most interesting creations that exist in all the Mexican territory and even when the time pass, is as important now and then.\\n\\n}Now we will expand the topic with the most interesting activity that represents this place. What is the riskiest activity you have done? You can think risk as many things like taking a ride by a bike or go parachuting or swimming with sharks. You know that is risky but at the end you know it\\u2019s worthy.  All these activities are fun but the most entertaining and awesome activity is going to la Quebrada de Acapulco. Even though is risky, going to la Quebrada de Acapulco is one hundred per cent worth it because it\\u00b4s facts and world recognition.              \\t\\n \\nLa Quebrada de Acapulco is not national but global. \\u201cIt is one of the most famous cliffs not only in Mexico but throughout the world, for its brave divers. In this place, some of the most traditional shows of the beach and Acapulco, in Guerrero are carried out\\u201d (V\\u00eda M\\u00e9xico, 2017). So, it is very common to see divers having so much fun in there.\\nPeople also come here with their families to swim and spend some family time. Ask anyone and they would immediately recognize La Quebrada de Acapulco. The activity of jumping from it started in 1934 when only professional cliff divers jumped off after climbing the complete riff with a torch in one hand, eventually, this professional practice was replaced for a cultural practice, in order for kids to ``turn\\u00b4\\u00b4 into men they needed to jump off from it. It even has more science that we may imagine, there is a way and technique to jump off safely. Divers see for water very carefully to be on a high level or waving a lot because if they jump off without a high height they could smash their head with the rocks on the bottom of the sea.\\n\\nJos\\u00e9 Andr\\u00e9s Orantes Guill\\u00e9n A01174130\\nFernando Molina Castellanos A01174143\\nPaola Salazar Hern\\u00e1ndez A01174132\\nJos\\u00e9 Luis Pascacio Cancino A01174153", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Quebrada", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/77/72/f3/la-quebrada.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "635118609": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "There are many fasinitating things to see and do in the Acapulco area.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183726-Reviews-La_Quebrada-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/77/72/f3/la-quebrada.jpg", "datePublished": "November 22, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I always have Roberto Alacron for driving my family in Acapulco.

If they would have shown any reluctance to perform their dives and climb the wall, I would not have been able to witness it.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Quebrada", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/77/72/f3/la-quebrada.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "555305314": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Evening Fun", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183726-Reviews-La_Quebrada-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/77/72/f3/la-quebrada.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We enjoyed the show, my kids were super excited each time a person would jump.

It was off peak so it is probably best to get there early to get a good spot. The 10:30 show has the last diver holding torches but the 7:30 showing was still pretty exciting with the speedo clad divers waiting for the swell to be just right before they leapt.

Our driver and guide Angel recommended the 1:00PM diving which fit our schedule. I wasn\\'t able to go all the way down the many steps due to recent foot surgery but Angel took me to an stone patio enclosure where I could sit on a chair and have a perfect view. My wife and daughter went all the way down. The view of the mountain rock Cliffs are unbelievably beautiful and the atmosphere there is wonderful. We watched these very brave young men driver climb up the rock cliff bare-footed. I couldn\\'t help but worry for their safety the whole time I was there. The 3rd young diver hurt his left foot climbing up and had his leg bent up as it must have been quite painful to stand. Another young diver came over and looked at his leg they must have stood there 30 minutes wondering what do. The only option was for the diver with hurt foot to jump from where he was, which he did after the 3 other dived. One super diver was at the very top of the rock and he was the only one to jump from there and he was the last one to jump. He prayed to the shrine of Mary that is on the top rock several times before he took his dive, and he turned a flip during his dive as did a couple of other. I believe all the divers prayed before they jumped. We met the divers on the way out and gave them a generous tip and asked for a picture with them. There were all very positive friendly young men. A couple of them appeared to be no more that 13-14 years of age. The one who dived from the top was the tallest I believe! To me all of these young men are giving a tremendous sacrifice to dive from this rock 2 times a day! This is an extremely dangerous feat and my heart goes out to all of them, as well as all of the other previous retired divers who have been doing this since the 50s.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Quebrada", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/77/72/f3/la-quebrada.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "510653286": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "a must", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183726-Reviews-La_Quebrada-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/77/72/f3/la-quebrada.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Costs 30-40 pesos per person to go in to the viewing area.

They first climb up the cliffs in the swim gear and bare feet then take turn praying, then either jump as a twosome or individually with numerous flips and turns! Just stunning! The facility has a lot of steep stairs over a few different levels or you can purchase drink and watch from in the bar. We got there early and headed to the lower level. Thank gosh we got there about 20mins early if not all you would be able to see is the back of other peoples heads instead of the divers entering the water.If you are quick with your camera you can get some really great shots!

Wow, we are so glad we went! Admission for the balcony (non-hotel) that the divers actually enter from is only 40 pesos for adults (cheaper for kids but I don\\'t remember the price), not expensive at all. There is a parking lot with an attendant who will direct you to a space, I honestly cannot remember if we paid to park but I don\\'t feel like we did.\\n\\nThe ticket counter is just past the giant metal statue of a diver and the two cannons, and the prices are posted on a giant banner over the entrance. You buy a ticket and enter, immediately surrendering your ticket to a diver at the entrance. Then there is a trek down a good number of stone stair cases to the viewing platform. Some of the sections of stairs are steep or uneven and are mostly full of people, watch where you are stepping!\\n\\nThis is a beautiful place to take pictures, especially at sunset! If you are taking pictures over the balcony edge (say, of the divers in the water), I would take extra care to hold tight to your phone or camera, people push near the edge a lot.\\n\\nWhen the show begins, there is epic music and the divers come down the same staircase you entered from with torches in their hands. They climb down the wall you\\'re standing at, jump in the water, and climb up the huge cliff on the other side. While you are waiting for the diver to reach the cliff on the other side there is an announcer spouting facts about things such as how fast they\\'re going by the time they reach the water. This is awesome unless you don\\'t speak Spanish, because it\\'s all in Spanish.\\n\\nOnce all of the divers are there, they take turns diving. Some dive backwards, some in tandem from different heights, some do somersaults. They are all amazing! If you go after dark, I think it\\'s the 10:30pm show, they dive with the torches in their hands!\\n\\nRegardless of what time you go, be sure to find a spot to stand early and stand your ground there carefully. I think we were 20 minutes early and there was room to stand by the wall at the front but it filled up quickly. You can only see the divers full descent into the water if you are actually standing by the wall itself.\\n\\nI would stand a little to the right, closer to the snack stand than the ocean because if you\\'re closer to the ocean, you\\'ll get wet when the divers come back up the wall after their dive. That\\'s right, they jump in right by you and come back out right by you, no special backstage entrance here!\\n\\nPeople will try to push their way around you to the wall, I was stepped on by a local who thought I would move away because I\\'m a little white girl. I\\'ll say again, be careful!\\n\\nAfter the show the divers have a bag for tips and they stand on the stairs as you exit by them. Some of them are available for photos there if you want one.\\n\\nThere are food vendors and souvenir shops near the entrance and throughout the parking lot if you get hungry or thirsty. There is even a table where you can pick a shell or plate and have it painted with a scene of the divers right there in front of you. We waited 10 minutes for one of these and only paid about 3 USD for it. They wrap your item in plastic wrap so it can continue drying and then again in another plastic bag so you can carry it.\\n\\nThere is also a public bathroom right by the ticket counter, but just like any other public bathroom in that area, there is no toilet paper, and there is a lady sitting outside the bathroom who will ask you for 5 pesos in exchange for a good handful of it. I personally always carry wipes in my bag and do not pay to use the restroom, but they will totally give you dirty looks and talk about you if you turn them down. Your choice.\\n\\nPROS:\\nAmazing show, amazing view, great photo op, cheap admission, food and drink available, souvenirs available, easy parking\\n\\nCONS:\\nSteep stair climb down and back up, pushy audience, fun facts are all in Spanish\\n\\nOverall we really enjoyed ourselves!

(Note: If I hadn\\u2019t paid the cop in cash, my papers were seized, the cost of the ticket would have been 5,200 pesos, I would have had to sleep another night in Acapulco etc.)\\nAlso, take the bus, not a taxi. If you must, ask the price BEFORE you enter. The trips are a lot more expensive than those in Mexico DF and taxis do NOT have taximeters. Open season on tourists on foot. One Mexican tourist we met was charged 70 pesos for a trip of 800 meters. We were charged 80 pesos for a 3.2 kilometers trip. Mirta and I thought this was a rip off. And Acapulco has the gall of having a publicity that says \\u201cHabla bien de Aca\\u201d. Before I \\u201cTalk well of Acapulco\\u201d, Acapulco should install taximeters and crack down on crooked police.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Quebrada", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/77/72/f3/la-quebrada.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "286750545": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "go somewhere else !!!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183726-Reviews-La_Quebrada-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/77/72/f3/la-quebrada.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "dangerous city, 800 + murders a year, mainly drug related, be careful traveling around city, stay on main streets &amp; highways", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "1"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Quebrada", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/77/72/f3/la-quebrada.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "286241412": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Watch your purse and stay with a group ladies", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183726-Reviews-La_Quebrada-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/77/72/f3/la-quebrada.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The divers are crazy!

The cost to go to the evening show was $1400 a piece which included the ride, and a dinner at the hotel overlooking the cliffs.  $1400 MX pesos is about $100 each.  A taxi to the location is about $300 pesos if you do not sign up for an excursion.  I believe the cost without the taxi is about $80 US for the seat and the meal.\\n\\nI must say that the hotel there, the El Mirador, is quite unattractive.  It apparently had its hay day in the \\u201960\\u2019s and \\u201970\\u2019s when numerous movie stars haunted there, but now it is a run down place.  The restaurant is part of the hotel.  It has tiered seating, so most everyone can get a good table overlooking the cliffs.\\n\\nThe meal we received included two drinks.  The meal was quite average and the hotel disappointing which is why I am giving this 3 stars.  I was told by the driver that you can alternatively pay about $5 per person for general admission to the viewing patio which is much closer to the divers, directly on the other side of the cliff for excellent viewing.  I can see from other reviews that you can get the meal for about $10 if you go there yourself and sign up for an excursion.  Makes me feel foolish for having signed up for the excursion there.\\n\\nI give the divers 5 stars as they were excellent.  My advise, just go there and do not sign up for the excursion with the meals.  And as we were leaving, we were told that the tip is not part of the $1400 pesos each.

Initially pure daredevils. The tradition has evolved into a school of divers with close to 70 participants and daily shows. They dive from a height of a 8 story building into a tidal pool of only 12 feet deep that swells and shrinks wave after wave. So, they must swim across to reach the cliff braving strong currents. Then, they need to get out of the water to start climbing the rocks avoiding being smashed or pushed suddenly by the fierce waves. Then, climbing barefoot all the way to the top. Finally, the dive with some flips, avoiding a free fall into the rocks and coinciding with a swell to avoid a dive straight to the bottom. Fascinating. There are shows every day. I recommend paying the 110 pesos to seat at the terrace of the Hotel El mirador. They will give you a free drink and you will avoid the crowds. Shows are every hour from 6 to 10:30 P.M.

Although being told the performance would be at 7pm, then 7.20pm, the show actually started at 7.40pm.

If i had a high res camera, would of captured great shots, but my hand held/phone camera isn\\'t that good at night. The views from teh restaurant you can at least see the waves below, the guys climb both walls, and watch the full dive as opposed to watching front view dives (which is tough).

The show was very worthwhile but the restaurant was just awful. Although we had reservations for our group they were not prepared for a group our size and there was a group of 175 waiting on buses behind us. This caused the restaurant to ask us to leave before we had a chance to eat. So we were at the restaurant for 2 1/2 hours and did not get to eat. We waited 30 minutes outside in line to get in only to find out the prices for our group had been increased over what had been quoted to us. The price went from 36/person to 39/person. You pay up front before you get your table. When they ask if you want drinks, which is extra, they don\\'t mean just alcohol that includes soda, coffee and water. Once we were seated it took 20 minutes to get our menus and that was after complaining. Then we ordered our drinks another 20 minutes passed before we got our drinks and that was again only after complaining (Side note, since the restaurant is built into a cliff, the manager and cashier are 5 stories up a set of stairs but you do get to walk by the bar :-) ). Others in our group had already ordered, been served and finished and leaving on one of the buses. When we were able to place our order and after 30 minutes we still did not have food and my wife\\'s blood sugar was crashing so I had to beg for food from other tables that had been served. Our group coordinator was able to get our money back after waiting for the manager for 30 minutes. The staff does not speak English and the manager very little which is very interesting for a Mexican restaurant that only servers American food.

The grounds were dirty and smelled of sewer.  The poor animals that were kept for display were in terrible condition as if they were sick.

I feel that many areas in Acapulco are either all rich people or all poor people...not much in between. We are average people - not rich not poor ....thrill seekers and over all well seasoned ....our experience at this beach was not good. The area is VERY POOR and people are RUNNING up to your car on the drive in trying to get you to eat at their restaurant and buy things. You have to choose a place because there is no other parking available. We selected a restaurant with beach chairs and a bath room. The locals were nice but the bath rooms were not clean at all!!! I can deal with basic but not filthy and no T.P. The food was ok but we couldn\\'t converse due to the 100s of vendors walking by us trying to sell their goods. I think the Mexican Gov should pass a law or make vendors stay on the beach and OFFER their goods but not push them on tourists - it was sickening. ( EVRY 10 sec they would hit you up and they WOULD NOT take NO for an answer.) I understand they are trying to do their job...but they dont seem to understand they are driving tourists away! Upon leaving - our bill was incorrect and my husband ( who is Mexican ) tried to sort it out with the owner and they would not adjust the prices to match what was in their menu - basically they were over charging us. My husband and I felt ripped off and would never go back. Too many other nice places to hit for beach view and food - such as Barra Vieja. We feel that in 5 to 10 years that whole area will be scooped up by a hotel chain and turned into condos. ( sad to say ) I feel bad for the locals - but it all goes back to Education and they dont know any better. It was a depressing experience. If you just want to hit the beach - I suggest the Diamond beach area and Barra Vieja. We ate dinner at Barra Vieja and the locals there told us &quot;they didn\\'t even like&quot; the Marques area. I hope the future generations of Mexico in this area all get a GREAT education so they can become the best restaurant and hotel owners and lift themselves out of this mess.

You can rent a table under an umbrella or in one of the beach restaurants for a pittance, or  you can bring your own umbrella. (With the intense Acapulco sun, you\\'re going to want a bit of shade.)

Still swimmable though and we were out there much of the day.\\n\\n Blue Water has 10x the menu of others in the area some high priced many reasonably priced but this is as stated in a prior review the class of Puerto Marques by far.

It has a great beach front setting.  We decided to sit under the deck on the sandy beach close to the waters edge with soft music playing in the background.  The tranquil vista and tropical breeze was refreshing. We each ordered diffrient venues from breakfast, lunch and even pizza (they have an awesome brick pizza oven).  All of the food was great, especially the pizza Yum!! Yum!.... There are a lot of toys to enjoy at Bluewater from a 10 passanger banana ride, jet skis, or a great one hour cruise of the bay that inclues two complementary cold beers. This is truly a perfect beachside escape. The water was clear and clean, the vendors were fun to work with or you can walk up the main street in front for adventure shopping. The beer was cold, the service was warm and friendly.  The bills at the end of the day were just what each of ordered. No rip offs here.  Parking is available in front of the resturant. On the main floor there is a great deck with a fresh water dipping pool and wonderful chaise lounges facing the bay. Talk about laid-back!  This is certainly the place for a long, long relaxing day.

Only about 2-4 tables with customers.  Most  hotels had few guests.   Consequently everyone is forced to cut corners.   Hire cheaper help (little or no english), serve less quality food, poor service from fewer and inexperienced hotel workers, and lots of other down grading.   Acapulco is active on weekends when the Mexico City folks come in.  But this is not enough to support the town.  Not much improvement in service, just lots more people for two days.

My most recent visit was April, 2006.  It\\'s been, for many years now,  considered Acapulco\\'s most &quot;high class&quot; beach - one that\\'s the least congested of the beaches in the city center (as compared to outlying areas), and a wide-range of services are available.  All beaches in Acapulco fill-up at Christmas/New Years and for the Semana Santa/Easter national holiday periods - but, even then, Playa Condesa will be the least congested.\\n\\nThe city requires beachfront restaurants to charge a fee to sit in chairs and under the umbrellas or palapas along the beach, not just at Playa Condesa but at many other beaches in the city.  For the money you pay you get a nice and shady place to sit, and waiters who run back and forth in the hot sand to get you cold drinks, something to eat, etc.  It\\'s a great set-up.  \\n\\nSome of the city\\'s best-known restaurants are located at the beach, including Beto\\'s and Paradise - both of which offer waterfront service.  Prices for things you buy at this beach will probably be higher than most other beaches in the city, though.  \\n\\nYou can rent jet ski\\'s, take a parachute ride (pulled by a motor boat), ride on one of the &quot;banana&quot; boats, arrange for scuba diving or touring of the bay in a small boat.  A very small portion of Playa Condesa is popular with the well-heeled gay travel crowd, particularly from Mexico City.  It\\'s a family beach, though - first and foremost.  \\n\\nThere are many beaches to go to in Acapulco and the nearby area, and although I don\\'t suggest someone spend all of their time at Playa Condesa, I do recommend it as a place to visit and enjoy - together with the rest of Acapulco.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa Condesa", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/d9/93/a6/blick-vom-hotel-emporio.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Costera Miguel Aleman s/n Frente al Hotel Fiesta Americana", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39690", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "3834795": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Ok, but some problems", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183724-Reviews-Playa_Condesa-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/d9/93/a6/blick-vom-hotel-emporio.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We went there in August, maybe this could be an influence.\\n\\nEven when the springbreak and high-season were over, this beach is overcrowded and full of vendors.

We got out of his nice van here to look at the mural more closely, and he walked us along this very long mural and explained it.  However, if a person wished to remain in the vehicle they could also enjoy the mural from there.  It is mosaic tile and is very beautiful.  It is the fence of a private home.  We were so glad to see this Diego Rivera mural because we missed seeing the painted murals by Diego when we were in Mexico City the prior day (different tour guide, of course).  Sebastian also does other very interesting tours in and around Acapulco, very reasonably priced because the price is for the whole GROUP of you in the van, not per person.

It is also quite large.\\n\\nWe visited the mural as part of our tour with Sebastian, and this was the part that made me especially thankful that we decided to do a tour and not just try to see things on our own, because it was in an area that I would not have wanted to drive to (I tend to feel uncomfortable driving on narrow streets in areas that I\\'m not familiar with), and although it is pretty to look at, it was way more interesting to see it while we heard about it.  \\n\\nI don\\'t know if guidebooks have the background story and tell what the different parts represent, but it was very cool and fun to hear about.  \\n\\nACCESSIBILITY: This is on a steep hill. You can basically drive right up to it, though.  Our toddler handled the hill fine, and if someone couldn\\'t do the hill, they would be able to enjoy about 85% of the experience without having to go up and down any hill.  From inside or right outside the car you can see all or most of it, it\\'s just a little farther away and you can\\'t see the details as well.  The mural is large enough that to appreciate it best it helps to be able to walk along it as you\\'re talking about it, but if someone couldn\\'t do that they wouldn\\'t have to be excluded.  Overall I think it is pretty accessible.\\n\\nLITTLE KIDS: This mural is on the outside of a house, in a neighborhood, on a hill.  The main places to stand while you\\'re looking at the mural are along a fairly narrow road.  I felt like we were constantly having to grab our daughter (20 months) to keep her out of the road, in case a car were to speed past (and several cars did go by while we were there).  The mural is engaging and interesting, but she was done with it before we were.\\n\\nCOST: Definitely free.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Mural Diego Rivera", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/14/80/46/mural-diego-rivera.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Inalambrica s/n A un costado del Hotel Casablanca", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "198216261": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Pretty cool", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183721-Reviews-Mural_Diego_Rivera-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/14/80/46/mural-diego-rivera.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Our tour guide Sebastian from Acapulco for All Private Day tours took us here.

While I watched taxis and other tour guides whizzing clients by and briefly showing the mural and stating: &quot;Diego Rivera did this mural&quot;, my family and I got a 30 minute discussion of the story behind the mural, Lola Olmedo\\'s role as an art patron, and the fact that the Olmedo family had sold the property (with this gorgeous mural--and a few others) for 4.5 million dollars. I was so moved by this discussion that I actually blogged the whole experience to my friends back in the US while I was still in Mexico.\\n\\nI strongly recommend that if you are going to see the mural, make sure you hire a tour guide that can give you the history behind the mural.. cos if you don\\'t, you are wasting your time AND your money.\\n\\nSebastian Hernandez tour--Acapulco for All--was well worth the money AND the experience.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Mural Diego Rivera", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/14/80/46/mural-diego-rivera.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Inalambrica s/n A un costado del Hotel Casablanca", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "39390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "154340670": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A piece of art history.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d183721-Reviews-Mural_Diego_Rivera-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/14/80/46/mural-diego-rivera.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I have been going to Acapulco for 30 plus years and did not even know about this until I read about it in a travel magazine.

We chose a viewing location nearly on eye level to the little blue shrines from which the divers congregate at the 135 foot height. This was a perfect location to record the divers climb the rock face from the waterline to the shrines at the pinnacle. From there I was able to record each of the dives, even the one that involved three men diving simultaneously--from the moment of the dive all the way to splashdown. NOTE: one can climb down (and back up) nearly 75 feet to a closer viewing position, but it honestly isn\\'t necessary. Our GoPro and 400mm Canon photos are fantastic. After the show, we remained for 30 minutes at a silver shop. NOTE: when purchasing silver make sure each piece is stamped .925 or you\\'ll get less than \\'pure\\' silver.  We then proceeded to Johnny (Tarzan) Weissmuller\\'s home and his former Las Flamingos Hotel on what we were told is the highest cliff in Acapulco. Today rooms are available to tourists. We were provided free beer, soft drinks, and use of rest rooms. Although we did not stop, we drove east to the Diamante (new Acapulco); Javier, our local guide, provided lively narrative filled with past and present information about his beloved Acapulco. Those who chose accompanied Javier to the Museo Historico de Acapulco at Fuerte de San Diego.  This is a must for history buffs. The 16th century fort, in the shape of a perfect pentagram, now serves to detail Acapulco\\'s lineage from it ealiest Indian inhapitants to the nation\\'s independence from Spain in 1821.

So sad. Mexico was an awesome place to visit. No more. Not in the immediate future ~ if at all.

This caused a delay of 90 minutes until a fresh pilot could be found.  This worked to our advantage because we did not sail until 22.00 instead of the planned 17.30, for which we were most grateful.  \\n\\nThey are currently rebuilding a new cruise terminal, so the approach to the old town was fraught with diggers, cranes, and holes in the road.  However we managed to reach the old town and walked round the market district, taking in the shops and street vendors, before finding an Internet caf\\u00e9 for US$1 for one hour!  We took a cab to a cafe right round the bay on top of a promontory with a very good view of the whole bay and our ship.  We had been recommended to visit Senor Frog\\u2019s bar but at 5.45pm it was dead.  This seemed to sum up Acapulco, where several other bars to which we had been recommended had closed down due to lack of business.  The local taxis are mainly old style VW beetles, in varying states of decrepitude.  Ours was no exception.  The driver said it dated from 1992, but its rust and lack of power on the hills suggested maybe 1972!   \\n\\nWe finished the day in Acapulco by going to Quebrada to see the divers who have one performance around 1 pm, and three shows later at night in the dark.  They charge 40 pesos (USD4) to watch the performance, paid in advance to a guy selling tickets.  People dispersed when the ticket seller came round. Our vantage point was a public viewing area built on one side of the small bay where the divers jump from a different side.  There was piped music and a Spanish commentary.  The youngest diver was 7 years old, about which his proud grandmother, who was standing next to us, informed us.  They dive from three different stages from the cliff, and reach these by climbing up the cliff face from the sea.  Although being told the performance would be at 7pm, then 7.20pm, the show actually started at 7.40pm.  This performance is quite impressive, not least because of the height of the cliffs from which they jump, but also due to the narrow gap between the cliffs into the sea.\\n\\nOverall, Acapulco disappointed.  The fact that this had once been the resort of the great and the good was remarkable, until one remembers we are talking about the 1950\\u2019s and 1960\\u2019s, and time moves on. This was no glitzy resort but bore the hallmarks of a tourist destination from which the tourists (foreign, at least) had gone.  This is perhaps a shame because at no time did we feel threatened or intimidated.  What was surprising was how few locals had any command of the English language", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Old Acapulco", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/f9/old-acapulco.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Acapulco", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "154503536": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Sunny Acapulco!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150787-d153234-Reviews-Old_Acapulco-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/f9/old-acapulco.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I just came back from acapulco yesterday!
