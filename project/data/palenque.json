We had a great guide that didn\\u2019t speak English (please be aware of this and ensure you know a few words of Spanish for your own safety) but whose knowledge of the falls was second to none. He took us from the top down the falls themselves; clambering, diving, sliding and jumping between pools. He took us behind parts of the falls and showed us wildlife. For those brave enough he also took us under the falls into a tiny cave where there was only enough air for 3 minutes. It was eerily silent after diving under the rushing water and was an amazing experience. Our guided fun finished up with a slide down the rocks on a plastic bottle (provided by the guide - don\\u2019t do this and leave stuff lying around) into a big, deep pool. \\nIf you are not a strong swimmer or get dizzy at all I would not recommend swimming; but it\\u2019s a stunning place to look around.

One of the best things is you aren\\'t swarmed by people selling things every step of the way.  A few little girls sold us bracelets, but that was all!!

But Roberto Barrios was unlike anything I expected! I went in thinking it would be a swimming experience with pretty falls to look at. The falls are everywhere - the water is everywhere. Our guide had us make about 5-6 stops over the course of 3-4 hours. The first place we slid down a waterfall on plastic bottles he provided into a giant body of water. We also hiked up waterfalls, jumped off more, swam under them to hidden caves and jumped off trees and cliffs into the water. There are caves that can be reached by swimming under the water. There was only enough time for one of us to experience it as it was towards the end so make sure to ask about it if that interests you. We only saw about 5 other people the whole time.

However it is worth to avoid the tourist crowds and visit the waterfalls of Roberto Barrios instead. \\n\\nWhen we visited the falls last month we haven\\'t seen a single tourist, and we had a great time together with one of the local people as a guide. Initially we were a bit skeptical whether we could get there and away on our own using the \\'collectivos\\'. However this is rather simple, go to the junction of 5a Avenida Nte. Pte. and Cuarta Pte. Nte, and ask around for the collectivos to Roberto Barrios. We found them by starting to ask around near the ADO bus terminal, and people where directing us to the 5th Avenida, asking a few more people on 5th Avenida pointed in the same direction, and eventually we found where the collectivos left. \\n\\nIt is a 40 minute drive to Roberto Barrios, and it will cost around 50 Peso p.p. When you arrive at Roberto Barrios there is a small hut which serves as the \\'entrance\\', there you have to pay 20 Pesos p.p. After you bought the entrance tickets, a local will offer you to be your guide. I would advice to accept their help, also for your own safety. They know the falls, where it is best to swim, where you can dive, and also where it is safe to slide down from one stage to the stage below (this was really fun!). They will also watch your stuff while you enjoy swimming in the falls. Our guide was super friendly, and was never in a hurry or bored to get back. I think they also like guiding the few visitors per day, it gives them also an incentive to spend some time in the falls and to cool down, instead of hanging around the entrance.\\n\\nAfter a few hours enjoying the falls, we went back with our guide. He didn\\'t even ask for a tip, but of course you can\\'t and don\\'t want to leave without. We gave him around 100 Mxn. After a short wait near the entrance, a collective back to Palenque arrived. \\n\\nLooking back we were really happy that we went to Roberto Barrios ourselves with a Collectivo, instead of a tour/taxi to Agua Azul.

It was very pretty and great to swim in them, you can even do a few jumps and go in some small caves.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cascada de Roberto Barrios", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/c0/2e/99/cascada-de-roberto-barrios.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Comunidad de Roberto Barrios", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "366050655": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Amazing waterfalls", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d3263589-Reviews-Cascada_de_Roberto_Barrios-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/c0/2e/99/cascada-de-roberto-barrios.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "After having a BBQ with a nearby family we went swimming in the Roberto Barios-waterfalls.

The current cost of a cottage rental is 400 pesos per night and it is absolutely worthwhile. The cottage we rented was for three people and we had plenty of hot water and the most relaxing atmosphere on earth. The sound of the nearby waterfall sounds like rain in the night and in the early morning we heard the local howler monkeys protesting the dawn, even before the rooster woke up. Just outside our window was the edge of the jungle and a flowing stream that was so inviting for a morning dip. We had a nice breakfast at the restaurant up the hill and then set out to explore behind the waterfall and up into the cave in the hillside next to it. There is an underground waterfall and shallow pool deep in the cave but you better bring a flashlight as it is pitch dark and you won\\'t see your hand in front of your face.

They\\'re not on some major park complex with trails; there\\'s only the waterfall and nothing else but I really enjoyed them.\\n\\nTo get there:\\nYou can take a tour which will charge either $120 pesos or $150, depending on the company. They\\'ll give you either 40 min or an hour at Misol Ha and 3 hours at Agua Azul (turquoise waterfalls during dry season about an hour away from misol Ha). The whole tour will likely last 7 hours. My recommendation, don\\'t take a tour. \\n\\nBy colectivo you can go first to Agua Azul for $35 on the vans that go to Ocosingo. The\\'ll drop you off on the road, at the entrance road to the falls. From the drop off it\\'s a bit of a ways inside so transport to get inside can run about $15 pesos per person. For the way out, it\\'s another $15 to get back on the main road. The bus from the drop off to Misol Ha is $25 pesos, then from Misol Ha to Palenque, it\\'s $20.\\n\\nYou will have to do some waiting for buses as they only depart point of origin when they fill but it\\'s often less than 20 min never more than 30. If you do the math doing it on your own and by tour is about the same. If you ask me, it\\'s better to stay longer at Misol Ha and less time at Agua Azul so I would rather wait a little for buses than submit myself to annoying tour itineraries.

We reached this place after about 2-3 hrs of a curvy street going through the mountains of the Sierra Chiapaneca. The street was to 50% destroyed, some parts of the street &quot;filled out&quot; with stones, some parts washed out by the rain,  nothing for week hearts  but the landscape just stunning. You cross many little towns in the mountains where locals sell from fruits to gasoline. (no gas stations on the way at all its only mountains. Please take precautions).\\n\\nI must say, probably my experience at agua azul is bias because of a group of people who stopped our van by standing in front of it and partially surrounding it, not allowing us to drive further unless we buy souvenirs and fruit from them. They approached our van and tried to open the doors while knocking hard on the windows. This experience in &quot;the mountains&quot; just left us already willing to turn around and forget about the waterfall.  \\n\\nAnyways, we finally made it to Agua Azul. During the rainy season the water is brown and you cannot swim however you get to see the &quot;power&quot; of the waterfall when 2-3 times more water is coming down. Fabulous. \\n\\nAs for the rest, it\\'s an extremely commercial place. There are places selling food and souvenirs from the bottom of the waterfalls all the way up to the calm pools. Sadly trash here and there, also in the water, mostly produced by the food sellers. \\n\\nI must say, my family visited this place 20 years ago and said to be paradise. I couldn\\'t confirm it. Maybe we were unlucky but as a traveler I also want to share the unpleasant experiences. \\n\\nIf you are in Palenque maybe try rather Misol-HA and cascades Roberto Barrios which are closer to Palenque. \\n\\nGood luck!\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "1"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cascadas de Agua Azul", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/a3/1f/agua-azul-january-08.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Reserva Especial de la Biosfera Cascadas Agua Azul Cascadas de Agua Azul Chiapas", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29920", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "501484753": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful, but crowded and remote", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d540535-Reviews-Cascadas_de_Agua_Azul-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/a3/1f/agua-azul-january-08.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The water is very beautiful and it\\'s an ideal place to spend the day walking, swimming, or doing light hiking. Do be aware that June through November are the rainy months and you\\'re likely to see only a river of brown water. Ideally, plan your visit for February through April. \\n\\n It\\'s a bit far from Palenque - almost two hours by car. A mile or two before the site, your car will be forced to stop and pay local kids in order to continue. Children line the street on either side, holding wires across the road, and when you stop the car, they bombard you and demand money. This is common in very poor areas in South America, and I\\'ve seen this type of shakedown before, but it\\'s not as common in Mexico. The children are not violent, and they were not accompanied by any threatening adults, but they do get more and more demanding as you continue down the road. We were stopped about 8 times, handing out coins each time - 5, 10, 15, 20 pesos each time to multiple hands reaching in the window. By the final point of extortion, the children were demanding more, boldly stating, &quot;Dame 30&quot;, and &quot;dame 50&quot;, and &quot;dame 100&quot; and finally &quot;dame todo&quot;  (Give me all of it). At first it was cute, but then it became a little tiresome, and finally off-putting, but we speak Spanish and were traveling with Mexicans from Veracruz, who came prepared with lots of change, so it was considered an endearing inconvenience. Don\\'t let it deter you from traveling here. Just be aware, patient, and come prepared with lots of pocket change. Consider it part of the price to be allowed entry into a beautiful natural wonder. \\nI usually take the bus everywhere in Mexico, so we went to Cascadas Misol-Ha first, and just ASSUMED that afterward we could catch one of many colectivos or buses passing by the entrance (they did not). There aren\\'t any buses that leave directly from Misol-Ha other than those blasted tour buses, but I\\'m sure you could catch a bus from Palenque in order to skip all the extortion stops. Personally, I prefer being extorted for pocket change than having something more precious extorted from me by tour companies - my freedom of choice. Arranged tours arrive with all the crowds and limit your exposure to an area to a few hours, then round everyone up and leave early. I think it\\'s far better to arrive here early in the morning and enjoy the day here. Definitely come on a weekday, and never during Semana Santa (spring break / the week before Easter).\\nAs for the site itself, we paid for parking as we entered and paid another person, a &quot;free agent&quot; offering to &quot;watch&quot; our car while we visited, much like the gangs of NY neighborhoods who used to collect &quot;protection fees&quot; to protect local small businesses from the protectors. But we paid 20 or 30 pesos and he went away. Better to just pay than come back to a car with a broken window. \\n\\nThis was the most crowded site we visited in Chiapas (aside from Las Cascadas de Misol-Ha). I debated whether it was worth visiting a site so far from Palenque, knowing it would be very crowded. It was (worth it). But you have to visit with the understanding that it will not be a serene experience in any way. This site is all about the views. You will need to screen out the background visitor chatter and vendors hawking their wares from many stalls along the river walkway. \\nA wide, upward-sloping concrete walkway has been built along the left side of the river/falls, which allows you (and hundreds of others) to shuffle your way along the river, inching your way to the front of the crowds to take photos from the wooden observation decks which jut out over the water\\'s edge.\\nThe farther up you go, the less crowded it becomes, and the more low spots you\\'ll find, where you can walk out along the rocks and take pictures or swim. There are restaurants along the river near the entrance, serving typical food. Pricier than town, of course. \\n\\nFor an extra fee of around 60 or 70 pesos per person, you can cross the river on a bridge and explore the other side. We were limited on time and didn\\'t do so, but I\\'m willing to bet its far less crowded on that side simply because it costs a few extra dollars. I only saw 3 people pay and proceed. \\n\\nDespite the many people everywhere you turn, the water, river, and various falls are so breathtakingly beautiful that you soon screen out all the people. If you resign yourself to the fact that there will be many people there and that you will have to line up for photo opportunities, you will still find the views and photos worth the crowds you must fight. \\n\\nIf crowds &quot;aren\\'t your bag, Baby&quot;, head for the lesser known, Cascadas de Roberto Barrio, a much smaller site with far fewer people and great jumping sites. \\n\\nHope that helps!

At the time of this review  (June 2017) Agua Azul is saturated with food and souvenir stalls and crowded with vendors. It now feels claustrophobic, dirty, hard to enjoy and  lost in tourist-land.  I understand that people from the surrounding communities need to find an income but wish the authorities were more careful on how much commerce to allow in the park.

You can choose from several large pool areas to enjoy the \\'aqua blue\\' waters. There is a narrow path that follows the falls up the mountain that is filled with restaurants serving fast food or sit down style. They all seem to have &quot;empanadas&quot;, 5 for 15 pesos. The path is also filled with little shops selling clothing, t-shirts, toys, &amp; other knickknacks.\\n\\nMake the drive when you have the entire day to enjoy the drive, the waterfalls, &amp; the food / souvenir stalls. And make the drive during the weekday, &amp; leave early. Take time to stop along the route to buy a snack or more from the local people who are trying to eek out a living. Make sure you have plenty of cambio/change to buy a mango or two, or some other exotic fruit. Enjoy the local vibe &amp; feel from the Mayan people.

It\\'s in the fine print.\\n    Unless you book directly with a tour company and are willing to accept a bit of a price gouge, it\\'s fairly easy to get there on your own.  You can find a collectivo near the ADO station or in Palenque Centro.   Just look for the vans with the Agua Azul sign in the front window, or head into Centro and look for a tour operator heading to Ocasingo or San Cristobal.  They will take you the 50 or so kilometers to the intersection which is 9km from Agua Azul(we paid 30p per person for this, about 2 hrs) and then take a taxi to the waterfalls. (another 40-60p total, about 5 minutes)  You will pay your entrance fee while in the taxi, 60p each if I remember correctly.\\n    There are way to many restaurants and souvenir vendors, in my opinion, but they at least line the path that leads you up to the top.  You will pass multiple swimming spots, and ultimately reach a sign where there will be a guide who will take you even further to a gorge that I\\'m sure you can read about in other TA posts.\\n     In our instance,  however, there was a growing protest by locals, apparently about massive gas price hikes, that went well beyond the usual \\'highway toll\\' paid by collectivo drivers.  We were forced to leave our collectivo about half way there, and walk about 1.5 km, find another collectivo, and pay another 30p (I know it\\'s not much), just to make it to the Agua Azul intersection.  \\n     This left us a little anxious about the time we should spend enjoying the beautiful waterfalls, and so we cut our time a little shorter than we would have liked, thankfully.  Upon our return, the blockade had grown to a full blown roadblock; a spiked 2x4 blocking the road until our driver paid 50p.  A few km later, there was a freshly cut tree blocking the road and several vehicles ahead of us which were not allowed to pass.  \\n     This is where it got crazy.  A man attampted to remove a boulder blocking the road, and he was then attacked by a protester with multiple blows from a machete.  During this melee,  all the vehicles in line managed to drive over the tree and travelled in convoy back to Palenque.  \\n     Talking with as many locals as we could, it was made clear that although the roadblocks demanding pesos were not out of the ordinary, the violence we witnessed was abnormal.  This was on January 25, 2017.  We left Palenque on the 27th, and as far as we could assertain,  the road from Palenque to San Cristobal,  and therefore Agua Azul, was still blockaded.\\n     If you\\'ve read this far, that is the point of my review statement:  Check with a few tour operators if the road is indeed open.  Although they are few and far between, some of these companies will charge you for the trip, then turn around at the blockade and tell you to read the fine print,  which clearly absolves them of refund in the case of \\'blockade\\'.(we met 2 people that day who were turned around without refund)\\n  While that is understandable on the day the blockade is erected, there were others we met who went to Agua Azul the next day and we\\'re turned around without refund, while the operators knew full well what was going on.

You Do NOT need a guid, just fallow the path, very easy. The water at the bottom is pretty light bright blue, it gets a little greener as you walk up, and some places it allows you to swim :) It got me a little worried when it started to rain at night till next day morning, cause some places blue water turn darker or browner when it\\'s raining or cloudy.

We went with Tierra Maya travel in San Cristobal and sadly we had a very bad experience. We got up at 4 am to leave around 5 am to tour the above 3 spots. Tierra Maya came to get us at our hotel which was helpful. We got about halfway there and there was a citizens protest and the road was blocked. We found out later that this happens about twice each month and they were well aware of this possibility. We had no choice except to return to San Cristobal and we missed seeing everything. As unbelievable as it may sound, Tierra Maya then refused to refund our money. In the end after much arguing they only refunded a fraction and only for the entrance fees they didn\\'t have to pay but they gave us nothing else. Since they know that these road block protests happen regularly any reputable company needs to inform its customers that such may happen and what the company policy is. Of course any reputable company would also refund 100% of your money since they did not deliver what they sold us. The driver also made an unannounced detour on the way back and brought us to another ruin. The majority just wanted to go home by then as we had all voted to do but once we got there 3 people in our group decided they wanted to see the ruin so the rest of us had to wait in the van for about 1 1/2 hrs for them. When we protested the driver lyingly claimed that we all voted to take the detour to see the ruins. Several Mexicans who speak perfect Spanish were in the van and so there was no misunderstanding, only lies so that they could find lame excuses to keep our money. I would never go with Tierra Maya again for any reason whatsoever and I suggest that you avoid companies that don\\'t take credit cards when taking tours that have the potential to be blocked by these regular protests. These people do not believe in repeat business nor do they care about such. \\n\\nOn a good note though if you are going to Panajachel Guatemala there is another Tierra Maya there which is run by Rufino and his wife and they are very good.  They did a great job and come thru on every promise with very reasonable prices.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "1"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cascadas de Agua Azul", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/a3/1f/agua-azul-january-08.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Reserva Especial de la Biosfera Cascadas Agua Azul Cascadas de Agua Azul Chiapas", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29920", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "278515417": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Very powerful", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d540535-Reviews-Cascadas_de_Agua_Azul-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/a3/1f/agua-azul-january-08.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A nice respite while touring the area by motorcycle.

That tour was the worst travel experience I ever had. Here is why.\\n \\nFirst, the driver picked me up 15 minutes ahead of time. Even though I was early and I had time to fill my water bottle (thank god I did then) he rushed me and he was rude. Then, he put my backpack (containing all my belongings) on the top of the van. Unattached/unsecured. I noticed at the second stop and I had to argue with the driver for him to buckle it up safely. \\n \\nThe van was in disrepair: no shock absorbers left and no seatbelts. The driver drove at least twice the speed limit and passed everyone on a treacherous road. He did not give any information or welcome the guests on board.\\n \\nOnce we got to Misol Ha, the driver announced that we couldn\\'t go to Agua Azul because of blockades on the road. I was concerned, since I paid 200 pesos extra to get to San Cristobal. He told me to go away and return at the appointment time for the next location. We tried to drive to Agua Azul, then turned around, and went to another fall closer to Palenque. There, I expressed my concerns again about getting to San Cristobal, and the driver told me, again, to go away and come back at 430. \\n \\nAt the fall, I met with other people in the same situation but with much, much better drivers. Two drivers tried to help me figure things out. My driver would not talk to me or give me information. The AXEL bus for San Cristobal was at 5pm, and there was no way my driver would make it back on time. Nevertheless, he did not let me ride back with 2 other tour guides who offered to help me (and who kept their customers informed, and helped them out). The driver spoke no English and mocked me for my broken Spanish. I have never felt so ill-treated on an organized, expensive tour in my life.\\n \\nTo end things off, the driver dropped me off on the side of the highway to catch the AXEL bus. He had not informed me of it, and he wouldn\\'t let me go away to grab diner and water (I did not eat or drink until 8 pm - the original tour was to include diner in Agua Azul). The driver did not apologize. He threw my bag on the bus, and I boarded without a pass.\\n \\nI don\\'t usually take tours, because they are too expensive. In this case, I took it for the convenience and safety - neither of which I received. AND I paid way to much money for the worst service I have ever received.

I took so many pictures getting to the waterfalls, I almost used a full camera battery and had to use my Samsung tablet as a camera.\\nJust loved the waterfalls, so much to see, many layers and, oh the colour and sound of the white water cascading into the aquamarine pools! It was great to be able to walk up alongside the falls and be able to see them from different perspectives. \\nThere were vendors along the way but they were not pushy, like they can be in others locations. In fact we kept noticing one little girl kind of walking along with us, who was carrying a covered bowl. She finally approached us and unwrapped the cloth, exposing what we call corn cakes. They were still warm and sweet, 4 to a package for 10 pesos (about 90 cents). Try them if you go to the falls.\\nThere were other vendors making and selling empanadas, 5 for 20 pesos. We decided to try them but were disappointed,  not much filling, kind of like eating greasy tortillas. I\\'d pass on this next time.\\nI recommend anyone travelling in this area to take this in as well as Cascadas Misol-ha.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cascadas de Agua Azul", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/a3/1f/agua-azul-january-08.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Reserva Especial de la Biosfera Cascadas Agua Azul Cascadas de Agua Azul Chiapas", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29920", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "195760737": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Piece of Paradise", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d540535-Reviews-Cascadas_de_Agua_Azul-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/a3/1f/agua-azul-january-08.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A beautiful site that is well worth seeing.

The road is quite curvy, be prepared if you get car sick. Also beware of kids &quot;blocking&quot; the way with ropes to ask for pesos or a bag of chips. They can be quite agressive but otherwise harmless. Getting to Agua Azul you will be directed to a parking space by a swarm of kids who will inform you that they will watch your car, you can tip them at the end. The bathroom facilities at the entrance are quite awful, dirty and smelly... and they charge $5 pesos to enter... there are other bathroom facilities inside, we didn\\'t go in there but probably same thing. This time of year the water in the falls was beautiful, blue as their name suggests. The first &quot;pool&quot; that we saw was quite muddy and not nice to swim in, it was so full of people that it didn\\'t look inviting at all.

The water was so clean and so cool and it was not too deep (I don\\'t know how to swim hehe), though in the middle of the river you could see people dipping in, I guess it was deep enough in the middle to do that.\\n\\nIt was a great experience and a very lovely place.\\nIf you want to buy souvenirs do not forget to ask what is the lowest price you can get! -&gt; &quot;Cu\\u00e1nto es lo menos?&quot; hehe.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cascadas de Agua Azul", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/a3/1f/agua-azul-january-08.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Reserva Especial de la Biosfera Cascadas Agua Azul Cascadas de Agua Azul Chiapas", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29920", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "149170285": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "So much water..", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d540535-Reviews-Cascadas_de_Agua_Azul-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/a3/1f/agua-azul-january-08.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Did not get to see the blue blue waterfall, it was cloudy and had been raining but just to see so much water is incredible.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cascadas de Agua Azul", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/a3/1f/agua-azul-january-08.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Reserva Especial de la Biosfera Cascadas Agua Azul Cascadas de Agua Azul Chiapas", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29920", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "147260059": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Very beautiful place", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d540535-Reviews-Cascadas_de_Agua_Azul-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/a3/1f/agua-azul-january-08.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is a place where you can take your food for picnic and also get into the water , specially in spring and summer.

The water is clear and blue just like you see in the pictures, as it turns out December is a great month to visit since the rain does not cloud the blue out of the river. I was a little bummed out that I could not go in the water, it seems that most of it is blocked off since it is quite risky. Only a few spots did I see people soaking their feet in the water. The cascades are breathtaking , the earlier you get there the better. As we were leaving a massive amount of tour buses created major gridlock, it seems they all get there late in the morning so if you rent a car you can beat the crowds. SHOPPING REVIEW: The edge is lined with vendors. I do not recommend doing too much shopping here even though a guide at Palenque told me that textiles and Bordados were cheaper here. Here is the thing I learned from this trip. If you see something you like don\\'t assume you will find it cheaper elsewhere. I did score and fail in this regard at this very location. I picked up an awesome embroidered overnight bag at a great price which I did not see anywhere else but also overpaid for a Tzotzil black embroidered skirt which I could have purchased in San Juan Chamula where there were 100\\'s to choose from for less than 1/2 the price. FOOD VENDORS: Try the empanadas 5 for 10 pesos, a very inexpensive and delicious meal. We had some filled with stinky cheese, others with what looked like a potato others filled with beans. Overall a great vibe !

Small shop, refreshments, toilets. I recommend going early morning or from 3 pm to avoid the worst of the heat and get better light for photos.

But I believe the zoo is doing some level of good by introducing species back into the wild. \\n\\nAll in all, a nice way to spend the morning and lovely to see some native and exotic species.

We are both keen travellers &amp; have experienced various types of \\'conservation\\' parks in the world through Asia &amp; Africa. This was the first one we went to in Central America. I was a bit unsure if I wanted to go after reading some of the comment\\'s on here about the animal\\'s. I\\'ve been to  \\'conservation\\' places In Asia &amp; Africa where its been absolutely terrible &amp; I\\'ve hated it. When I am not travelling I work as a Veterinarian nurse &amp; have a deep love for animals &amp; environment conservation. Thankfully, we were both very happy that we went to Aluxes &amp; donated both our time &amp; money. It is one of the good ones! We do agree with some of the comments that the wild cats need bigger enclosures, as do the bigger bird\\'s. However, Once we had finished walking about the sanctuary, I made some enquiries with the manager, asking who looks after the animal\\'s ? how they were obtained? their future ? &amp; the concerns that we had. She told me that all of the wild cats were seized from from illegal traffickers by authorities or abandoned by people who had obtained them illegally, intending to keep them as domestic pets. She assured me that the animals get regular veterinary assessments &amp; the organisation work\\'s very closely with a biologist who is in charge of the enclosures. She said a key focus for them is to make sure they are creating environmental enrichment &amp; stimulation for the animal\\'s. Sadly, none fo these cat\\'s can be released back into the wild &amp; be expected to survive. She assured me that all of the enclosure\\'s are at or above the international standard for sizing.  One of the jaguar Negro\\'s (black panther\\'s) did appear to have some sort of deformity with one of it\\'s front claws, however apart from this it looked very happy, healthy &amp; even a bit fat. The female Ocelot appeared to be agitated when we arrived at her enclosure &amp; we saw her doing circle\\'s inside of her enclosure, we sat down and watched her for quite some time to see if this would change. This behaviour from her has been mentioned in reviews by other tourists who have also witnessed this. After about 10 minutes we realised it was lunch time &amp; that she was reacting to this, the circling got worse when the male Ocelot, who is in another enclosure got fed first. Once she had her chicken, she ate it straight away &amp; then went to sleep. She didn\\'t appear to be neurological or stressed after eating &amp; her enclosure didn\\'t suggest that she does this circling all day, however we mentioned it to the manager who was grateful that we told her &amp; said she would tell the biologist straight away so they can adjust her habits. Undeniably you want to see these cats in the wild where they belong &amp; when they aren\\'t, we resent that fact. I still do agree that the enclosures could be bigger, despite them meeting an international standard, however, we don\\'t know if the animals have medical problems that require them to have a restricted exercise regime. This is the case again for the bigger birds. Perhaps they have had an injury to their wing which means they cannot fly or be released into the wild or have a cage big enough that would allow flight attempts. It\\'s not a perfect solution for these animals, but in an imperfect world it\\'s the best possible solution. I loved the fact that the cats were not being exploited for unrealistic tourist encounters or bred within this conservation park. I have a big problem when tourism and money are justification for breeding wild or exotic animals so that tourists can have extra special encounters with their offspring, for example the lion cub cuddling that we saw in Africa. I felt like all the animal encounters here at this place were done very responsibly so that both the animals &amp; people had a nice interaction. The manager told me about the wonderful work that they have done in conjunction with the authorities &amp; the general public to create awareness &amp; education. It was also really good to be told about the breeding &amp; successful rehabilitation &amp; release programs for some of these animals. The howler monkeys are a good example of this. The original 2 where seized by authorities after being sold on the black market. Thankfully Aluxes could take them in,  which was a much better option that euthanasia. They are currently critically endangered, as are a lot of the animals we saw in Aluxes. Reading about the animal\\'s survival status &amp; realising that so many of them were critically endangered was the only bad thing about the day. We spent 4 hours looking at the animals in enclosures &amp;  exploring the natural areas of habitat, looking out for wild birds, reptiles &amp; insects that were in abundance here. I would definitely recommend going here &amp; supporting this organisation. Our highlights were the Manatee\\'s, Flamingo\\'s, Tucan, Macaw, Spoonbill\\'s (there are soo many birds here!)  Tapir\\'s, the cats, otters, monkeys, anteater, racoons.... the list could go on forever!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Aluxes Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/89/c7/7c/photo2jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera Palenque-Ruinas Km 2.6", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29960", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "608235561": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Love it but room for improvement", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d3182027-Reviews-Aluxes_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/89/c7/7c/photo2jpg.jpg", "datePublished": "August 19, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "After a long and very uncomfortable trip to Yaxchilan and Bonampak we decided to ditch plans to go to Agustin Azul and do this eco park instead.\\nWe arrived at 9am and had a great 2 hours walking around the trails and seeing all the animals.\\nDefinitely best to do early in the day while cooler and animals are more active.\\nWe loved the all the birds (the macaws in particular) and seeing the wild howler monkeys in the area.\\nThey clearly do a a great job but I agree with other reviewers that more information is needed to explain how the animals were rescued and what their status is (going to be returned to the wild or can\\u2019t be because of...)\\nOnly other thing is that some of cats could definitely use bigger enclosures.

We arrived around noon and stayed until 3:30. The park costs $100 pesos each for adults and $60 pesos for kids. It is well worth the time and your money goes to the conservation of the animals that are kept here. This is an ecopark dedicated to the rehabilitation and reintroduction of native species to the wild, rather than a zoo. Do not rush your time here. There are so many animals to see and they are all in large spacious habitats. 95% of the animals are native to Chiapas with a few species visiting from Africa. When walking around the park there is a long path and a short path. Take the long path. That is where we found spider monkeys hanging out right on top and beside the walkway. If you are interested in feeding animals the night tour includes manatee and crocodile feedings as well as the opportunity to hold a boa constrictor. If you decide to do these activities the feedings cost $100 pesos each and holding the boa costs $50 pesos in addition to your entry fee. You can pay $250 to do these during the day or pay $300 pesos for the night tour where it is all included. We loved the park so much we decided to return that evening for the night tour. At the end of our visit we asked about the night tour.  At that time there was no one signed up. But by the time we returned at 7:00 there was a total of 20 people in the group. The tour itself is very educational but is led in Spanish. Because our group was large and consisted of primarily English speakers, a translator came along as well. As I am fluent in both languages, the Spanish version is much more informative and the English translation was merely a summary of everything the zoologist had said. I highly recommend going both during the day and at night. The daytime is great for taking photos of the animals. However, many of the species living there are nocturnal and we only saw them during the night tour. The only washrooms are by the entrance to the park, beside the palapa where you can buy beverages. Underneath the palapa is where you can find Scarlett Macaws and Blue and Yellow Macaws and is a great photo opportunity. These birds are not in cages and are allowed to fly around freely. We also spotted a group of 6 or 7 in the trees above the path. The Scarlett Macaws had been extinct in Chiapas for 70 years prior to 2011. In 2011, Aluxes began reintroducing the species to the wild. We were also informed that on August 15th or 16th I\\'m not 100% sure which, they are going to release another batch of Macaws into the wild. Their hope is that they will live in and around the Palenque ruins. We also found out that the park is quite large (45 acres), however you actually only see 5 acres when you visit. This is because their first priority is always the animals and their conservation. If you happen to go to Palenque, make sure you give this place a visit.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Aluxes Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/89/c7/7c/photo2jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera Palenque-Ruinas Km 2.6", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29960", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "507113230": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Don\\'t be skeptical.

Ideally, you would not see any of these amazing creatures at Aluxes--jaguars, ocelots, peccaries, monkies, deer, flamingos, parrots, and scores of other jungle wildlife--but many of these animals are being rehabilitated. Many have been rescued from the illegal trade of exotic wildlife that is a thriving business in Mexico, Central and South America. Some animals call Aluxes their permanent home because they are unable to ever survive being released in the wild. Even if the day comes when no more animals need rehabilitation or a protected place to live, Aluxes will still be a beautiful place to visit. \\n\\nThe easy walking trails will take you through jungle vistas where you will see lots of wildlife that calls Aluxes home. As birders, we were able to see all kinds of beautiful birds that come to the waters and trees and vines and flowers of Aluxes. \\n\\nIf you enjoy birding, you might want to purchase a copy of the magazine they sell in the visitor center called Diversidad De Aves En Aluxes. It contains many beautiful photos of many of the 153 identified birds you may see on your walk. \\n\\nI particularly enjoyed the Scarlet McCaws that fly overhead or just sit in the treetops as you walk by. These incredible birds were extinct in the area for 70 years until 2013 when these majestic birds were reintroduced to the area by the dedicated staff at Aluxes.

So this place is NOT your traditional \\u2018zoo\\u2019 set-up.\\nWhile visiting we saw lots of small monkeys of various species - crocodiles, deer, tapir, otters, terrapins/small turtles, flamingos. There were some captive macaws and smaller parrots too. The highlights for me were seeing up close the spotted and black jaguars and a couple of ocelots. The Ecopark is also home to a flock of approx 80 wild scarlet macaws. These are very endangered in Latin America and had been re-introduced in order to boost their numbers. The scarlet macaws are flying free but regard the Ecopark as their home territory so are easy to spot. They have some nest boxes and supplementary feeding to help them get re-established. It was magical to walk round the park hearing the macaws calling to each other as they flew overhead. If you like wildlife do take the time to visit this place if you are in Palenque.

I think i went there four times, seduced back by my desire to feed their four manatees - yet again!  Never could i tire of this experience.  They are such incredibly beings that I felt honored they would take food from my hand.  Be sure and ask (if you speak some Spanish) the man who provides the food to tell you about them, and be sure and give him a tip, too. I will never forget my time with them.  Besides manatees, I held a baby croc and baby boa, and even feed crocodiles.  Quite an adventure.  If you can try their night tour you won\\'t regret it.  The price of the tour includes feeding the manatees and crocs as well as holding the baby croc so it is well worth the price - they need 4 people minimum, so unless you provide that many people they can\\'t always do it - and it is in Spanish only.\\n\\nI hold all of Aluxes dear to my heart.  They are the reason you can see scarlet macaws flying overhead after 70 years of extinction.  And they are educating the people of the area, particularly the children to see the world through an ecological lens.  Thank you Aluxes for all you do, not only for Palenque, but for the world.

Our children, ages 6 and 8, loved all the animals. We paid the 100 pesos each to get in, then addition 50 pesos for each of the girls to handle a macaw and a tortoise, and 100 pesos each for us to feed manatees. It was still a bargain. The animals are all rescues or have conditions that make them unable to live in the wild.

Jaguars, ocelots, crocodiles, a white tailed deer with a spider monkey buddy sitting on his back, wild monkeys and rescued ones, whistling ducks, dozens of turtles and tortises, two kinds of wild pigs, coatis, raccoons, and a variety of other animals. \\n\\nIn addition to the captive macaws they have a breeding program for the scarlet macaws and release the young into the wild to help repopulate them. Wild ones flew over several times while we wandered the park, a beautiful sight. \\n\\nThe highlight for us was feeding the manatees, although the water was muddy. They came right up and we were given large bowls of vegetables for them. We petted their noses and felt the rough whiskers, it was wonderful to be so close. \\n\\nThere is an optional trail toward the back that leads to the bamboo forest and I highly advise you take it. It leads across the water over rocks that stick up (made me think of the movie Labyrinth and glad that it wasn\\'t the bog of eternal stench.) There are no animals on that trail but the huge bamboo is impressive and crossing the water is fun.

A few were caged, mainly for safety reasons.  That said, most had spacious areas to roam.  For example, the monkey areas are islands surrounded by water.  So, the monkeys are not caged in at all, but free to swing on trees and rope structures. \\n\\nWhen you walk around, there is jungle all around you.  There are stone pathways that meander from one animal area to another with green plants and trees everywhere.  It was very peaceful.  There were many birds flying around us  as we walked the paths.  There were two Macaws that seemed to follow us around through the park, which was just an awesome experience.   \\n\\nThe staff was friendly and answered all of our questions.  I got a sense that staff at the park are dedicated to the animals they care for each day, and it\\'s more than just a job. Many of the animals in the park are injured or come from illegal animal trade.  So, unlike your typical animal attractions, the park is a rehabilitation center as well.\\n\\nThe price of admission was reasonable, well worth it!\\n\\nIf you are in the area and want to see something besides the ruins, I would recommend a stop into the park for a few hours.

Exhibit animals mostly represent local fauna, so it\\'s all very organic. The main attraction nowadays are free-ranging scarlet macaws reared and released by a reintroduction project operating in the park. From what I understood, the project enjoys full support of park\\'s administration and brings in increased attendance in return. I thought this was a great idea, and those large colorful noisy birds really add an unforgettable touch to the whole experience. The park is mostly visitor-friendly, with cobblestone pathways, signage, maps and friendly staff, and can be enjoyed by families with small children as well as nature enthusiasts and birders. On the downside, the paths become extremely slippery when wet (which is 90% of the time in this climate), so wear sturdy shoes and watch your step. English translations of the signs are a bit awkward. And if you decide to visit the aviary, beware of an overly friendly Yucatan jay which will land on you and try to pick on everything you wear or carry. This may be fun to some people (like me) but very frightening to others, and scared visitors might actually harm the bird, trying to free themselves. There were no warning signs posted on the aviary entrance, so consider this your warning.\\nOverall the park was a great experience.

The area, a pasture 20 years ago, is now a thriving junior-jungle, with a wide variety of endemic trees and plants as well as the local animals.  The swampy pasture was transformed into a series of islands, separated by streams, with many of the different species easily visible from the walkways without the need for cages.  Jaguar cubs tussling over a bone under their mother\\'s indulgent gaze, alligators waddling rapidly towards a flapping umbrella held down towards them,  and spider monkeys leaping through the branches to keep an eye on a jaguar-print raincoat were some of the highlights of this visit.  We wanted to take the nocturnal tour but we found out at the end of our visit that we should have signed up for that earlier since it is only given when 10 visitors ask for it.  The educational signs referring to the trees were a bit confusing.  On the other hand, the howler monkey island is so comfortable that a troop of wild monkeys has taken up residence there!  The owners receive donations of older animals that have been kept in captivity all their lives, gently reinserting them into jungle life.

Since the big tourist season was over, I was able to wander in peace and solitude. The first day it rained which only enhanced its intangible beauty. The second day the sun was out and the late afternoon light was absolutely beautiful. When it was time to leave, I took the path which leads to the museum and walked through the rainforest past a waterfall. You should do the same so that you can savor the jungle and its powerful presence. The museum, by the way, is excellent.\\n\\nReaching Palenque is not easy. It has a tiny airport which doesn\\'t function most of the year. Most people fly into Tuxtla (via Mexico City) and spend a night in San Cristobal de las Casas before catching the bus which takes five hours to reach Palenque. This is the route I took in 2006 except I spent a few days in San Cristobal. But there is a shorter route which I adopted this time by flying into Villahermosa from Houston.\\nThere is a daily 5:35pm flight from Houston which gets into Villahermosa at 8:20pm.\\nYou can catch the 9:30pm bus to Palenque directly from the airport or spend a night\\nin Villahermosa and visit the La Venta Park (with its Olmec artifacts in a jungle-like setting) next morning before catching one of the many ADO buses to Palenque (takes 2 1/2 hours). This was my itinerary and I would recommend it.\\n\\nFrom Palenque, you must visit Bonampak and Xachilan, the latter on the Guatemalan border. You can cover both on the same day by taking a tour bus which any one of Palenque\\'s travel agencies will arrange for about $45. Xachilan is remote, reached by bus and boat, deep inside the jungle. It fees like it\\'s been just discovered.

When you arrive at the National Park you will be approached by many English speaking guides.  I recommend you choose one because, otherwise, you will be on your own not knowing what you are looking at - they are worth the cost.  However, try to negotiate a better price and make sure you are comfortable with the guide\\'s accent.  If one doesn\\'t speak clearly enough then move on to the next.  Bring bug juice, hat, sunglasses, small towel if you have one to wipe the sweat off your face.  They sell water there, but make sure you buy it right after getting off the bus.  Have fun.  P.S. If my memory serves me correctly then you will pay a fee while still on the bus as you approach the park - this is the entrance fee to the park itself.  Then, once you are off the bus, you must buy tickets to enter the ruins.  So, don\\'t be surprise when you are pulling out money the second time.

Although it is a tourist attraction, the place did not feel crowded. \\n\\nESLVentures.com", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "National Park of Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/38/2e/palenque.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera a Palenque- Zona Archaeologica Km. 8", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29960", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "265760566": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "The greatest day of my life", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d153721-Reviews-National_Park_of_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/38/2e/palenque.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Go to the nearby restaurant and backpacker hostel (the name escapes m) and ask to do a jungle tour.\\n\\nThere are 2 brothers that run the tours and both are extremely knowledgeable, fun and friendly.\\n\\nThe experience we had i still count as the best day of my life.\\n\\nTry it.

During the morning and afternoon there are colectivos running along the main street so we flagged one down. It only took about 15 minutes to get from town to the archeological site. Note that you have to pay an entrance fee to get into the national park and another entrance fee to get into the archeological zone. I can\\'t recall what the national park fee was but the archeological zone fee was $57MX. \\n\\nThe ruin site is decent size but can be easily explored in 3 hours. You can certainly spend more time depending on how intricate your exploring methods are. The ruins are well restored and well maintained. Most of the structures are climbable but a few are roped off. This site doesn\\'t have the tallest pyramids in Mexico but you can still get a great view from the tops of some of them. There aren\\'t a lot of carvings or drawings left as looters have pillaged the site over the centuries. Luckily there are still a few spots where artwork is visible.\\n\\nThere\\'s a small market within the archeological zone for purchasing souvenirs. Most of the vendors are selling the same stuff but there is a lot of nice stuff. We were able to get a Mayan calendar painting for 50% cheaper than the original asking price so be sure to make low ball offers.\\n\\nWhen you\\'re ready to go back to town there are Colectivos waiting in the parking lot. In town we were told that it\\'s $10MX each way but we were charged $20MX each way. Perhaps we were ripped off but oh well, it\\'s the price you pay for visiting amazing places like this sometimes :)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "National Park of Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/38/2e/palenque.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera a Palenque- Zona Archaeologica Km. 8", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29960", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "151079223": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A unique site!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d153721-Reviews-National_Park_of_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/38/2e/palenque.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Archaeological site in the middle of the jungle, not much touristic and with a magical atmosphere.

We chuckled and met another guide going with a small group, paid 100 pesos each. My wife purchased a poncho at the ruin entrance for 50-60 pesos. Palenque is in one of the wettest regions in Mexico. The rain added to the mystery of Palenque. The rain clouds shrouded the tops of some of the ruins. The ruins are in excellent shape for being buried by jungle. There is still some stucco and color remaining in and on the parts of the ruins. There are also very detailed carvings still remaining at Palenque. The uncovered part of Palenque is so impressive because at the site you realize it is only a small portion of what remains uncovered in the area. Easily visible and towering over the uncovered ruins is hill with an uncovered temple. I was told the uncovered temple is as large as the pyramids in Eygyt. We were allowed to enter some of the ruins to see some tombs and sleeping areas. Some areas we explored i heard will be closed within the next year. At the entrance/exit area to the ruins there is a gathering of vendors selling their wares and food stands. \\nParking was a little tough for those who came later but really only added a few more minutes of walking to the ruin site.\\nThe jungle walk was a fun walk through the jungle. We saw unexcavated ruins along the trail and some unique fuana. Was a river with waterfalls along the trail.Although available we did not hire a guide for the walk.\\nMuseum- well worth the time. It would be a shame not to go to the museum if you were at the  ruins.\\nThe museum has decorative collections that should not be missed.

If you are driving or taking a taxi you will have to pay a M$20 park toll per person at the park entrance gate, located about one km before the ruins.  You will also be offered a nice map of the site at a modest price, which I would recommend you purchase.  The admission to the ruins at the entrance is modest, M$85 and the entrance fee to the site museum is included in the entrance fee.\\n\\nThe site differs from many other Maya sites in a number of ways, for instance there is no central plaza or acropolis, and the ball court seems relatively modest for such a large site.  The famous four-storied tower that may have been a lookout or observatory is unusual, and the interesting vaulted water delivery system is unlike any I have seen.   \\n\\nThe best experience is to come upon the ruins in the early morning hours, as the park opens at 8 am, to find the temples covered by mist in the lovely jungle setting.  For this reason alone, it is worth staying overnight in town.  The largest and best-preserved ruins are in the Principle Group, the area you will come upon if you enter by the main entrance.  The first building to your right is the Temple of the Inscriptions, the tomb of King Pakal, located deep inside the pyramid.  Unfortunately, the tomb is closed to the public.  \\n\\nAfter the main group, you can walk through the rain forest down a lovely paved path, which leads to lesser buildings, a charming area with waterfalls and pools that should not be missed.  The paved path leads downhill to the exit/secondary entrance close by the museum.  The museum, which is closed on Mondays, gives one a greater understanding of the people who inhabited Palenque and is well worth seeing.  Don\\u2019t miss the fabulous incense burners, which were found at the site.\\n\\nRegular transportation back to town leaves from the museum/restaurant area.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "National Park of Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/38/2e/palenque.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera a Palenque- Zona Archaeologica Km. 8", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29960", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "123702080": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Mystical exploration", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d153721-Reviews-National_Park_of_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/38/2e/palenque.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "my favourite of all , its mystical and well conserved all in a spectacular location .

Palenque is one of the best Mexican wonders, it was awesome to be there.  It is surrounded by jungle trees and  there are like 5 buildings (ruins) to watch. You should hire a guide to understand the buildings and what they serve for. Entrance is like 51mexican pesos which will be around 5 dlls  per person. You can take pictures (without any flash). If you want to take video you will have to pay around 5 dlls more. I paid for it and worth it, I can review every detail I recorded from that magical place. You cannot enter any food, you can only enter your water bottle. Get your outdoor shoes and your insect repellent.

We have slowly been working our way through them one by one and I have to say that Palenque lived up to the hype. It\\'s beauty is incomparable with an amazing jungle backdrop. You will not be disappointed. So many of the ruins you can actually walk into, the tricky part was getting pictures without the crowds in the background. That took some creative camera work, but the grounds are so extensive that you can easily wander through and end up at some spots all alone. We visited a few days after Christmas 2010 arriving late ( so we missed the early morning howler monkeys)  due to a long night at a karaoke bar and gnarly hangover. At 9:30 in the morning the drive up the hill was massively locked by buses and minivans , completely saturated with tourists. I have never seen so much activity at an archaeological site EVER !!! Not only great ruins but also a great place to people watch, I had an appreciation for watching the vendors hustling and the indigenous women balancing heavy loads ofmerchandise on their heads while rushing every prospect. FOOD: We had a jammin\\' meal at Palenque at a street vendor selling tamales wrapped in banana leaf. They had a smoky flavor, that I am craving even as I write this. Don\\'t miss out, it is always worth risking a little diarrhea for a potential epic meal.

I am very aware of security issues and I saw absolutely nothing that made me feel the least bit uncomfortable while in Chiapas. \\n   We woke up in the city of Palenque and headed towards the ruins to arrive soon after they opened.  We stopped at a checkpoint and paid to enter the Palenque National Park, we then drove about 10 more minutes to the entrance to the ruins. There are many souvenir and food booths near the entrance and because we arrived early, we were able to park very close to the gate.

The next pyramid had an entrance halfway up the central stairs and it was interesting to be able to explore the corridors inside. My favorite feature of Palenque is the \\u201cPalace,\\u201d the central tower looks more like something that you would see in Asia than Mexico. There were a few more temples and pyramids to climb and the only one that you are not able to climb is the Temple of Inscriptions. Most of the stairs are very steep but the views from the top were really beautiful. There is also a good bit of open ground to walk around and take in different views of the ruins. From any direction you immediately knew that you were not in the US, the trees, plants and birds were all very tropical. We saw a couple of toucans flying, something that we had never seen before.\\n   There were a lot of indigenous vendors with their art displayed on blankets among the ruins; they were not pushy like they tend to be at other sites. As we exited we stopped at a couple of booths and bought water and fruit and the best chicken tamales that I had ever had in my life. We took the advice given in a couple of books which said that eating from street vendors is not only safe, but it provides a real cultural experience, an opportunity to interact with interesting people, and the money goes to the people who need it the most and they are very appreciative of your business.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "National Park of Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/38/2e/palenque.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera a Palenque- Zona Archaeologica Km. 8", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29960", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "65591516": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A Lost World in the Jungle", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d153721-Reviews-National_Park_of_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/10/38/2e/palenque.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The site is a huge sprawling complex of Mayan burial sites, of which about 10% has been properly uncovered.

A friend of mine who had visited there some years ago urged me to go there on a recent trip to Mexico and it was by far the highlight of the entire trip by a mile and then some.\\n\\nCompletely off the beaten path and nestled  in the middle of the jungle is the most amazing setting I have ever beheld. Imagine undulating land, steamy and luscious jungle spotted with howler monkey\\'s and the most gracious ruins rising majestically from the bright grassy hills and shrouded in early morning mist. Sounds too good to be true - but it isn\\'t. Besides the visual feast of towering elephant ear\\'s, palm trees, mosses and creepers, a veritable rainbow of butterflies decorates the cascading green like multi-coloured Christmas decorations. \\n\\nBreaking the silence, Howler Monkeys - who rule these forests - bring the canopy to life and can be seen at all times of day (though they seem to prefer howling earlier and later in the day). If you don\\'t know what these Monkey\\'s sound like check out this online mp3 http://www.naturesongs.com/howler5.wav - apparently they\\'re the loudest mammal in the world - and definitely with the eeriest sound. Their roar echoes through the jungle and commands even the smallest of creatures attention. Keep your eyes peeled on the upper-most canopy and you\\'ll be sure to see these rather small dark friends swinging from branch to branch; if you\\'re lucky with a baby or two on their backs.\\n\\nThen there are the ruins; as you follow the path up into the park the trees suddenly clear and on a sunny day, the light reflects brilliantly off the first stretch of pyramids. This is truly a majestic place. The pyramids seem to soar out from the earth, touching the sky and taking their rule over this area of jungle.\\n\\nWhen my partner and I went it was rather quiet, by way of tourists, and we  spent an entire day climbing every pyramid on site and taking 100s upon 100s of photos. Be ready for a workout if you\\'re up for it, as you\\'re still able to climb and explore pretty much every monument in this park. We didn\\'t bother with a guide but eavesdropped on a few talks given by local archaeologists and discovered some amazing facts about the site. If I had it over to do again (which i plan to as soon as i have more dollars in my piggy-bank) I would have looked into paying a qualified archaeologist to take me for a guided tour.  Apparently the site is still actively being worked on so there are a few archaeologists in the area who are happy to give guided tours. \\n\\nOne of the most amazing aspects on this park is the fact that you can actually walk deep into the buildings which are dark, moist and dimly lit - but oh-so-fascinating. Be sure to keep an eye out for their ancient toilets (very interesting!), the tomb of Pakal\\'s mother and also look out for the remnants of original paint which can be seen as blue and red flecks, particularly in the upper most eaves of the structures. There\\'s an old national geographic which reconstructs an image of Palenque as it would have looked in it\\'s heyday - mighty and statuesque in it\\'s rich terracotta red and trimmed in a royal blue - look out for this pinned to the wall of the Internet cafe at El Panchan. \\n\\nPalenque is truly a destination worth visiting and I simply can not wait to go back there.

First of all I truely enjoyed my time at Palenque.  I have seen several ruins in Mexico (Tulum, Chichen Itza, Coba, Monte Alban and others) and Palenque is the best by far (although the others are nice, too.).  Only Tikal in Guatemala beats it as far as Mayan ruins go.\\n\\nWhat makes this ruin so spectacular is that it is up against the jungle background setting and has a nice layout of many buildings.  Some of these buildings have nice detail.  In the background you can hear howler monkeys (although I did not see any.), and see other wildlife.  It truely is a picture perfect ruin to visit.  Take a look at the photos I submitted to get a feel for it.\\n\\nI agree with the previous reviews of Palenque in their content and on the recommendations of the guides.  The guides give your very basic information which you can find out ahead of time by reading the basics before visiting the ruins, and they do not take you to any special areas that you cannot visit on your own.\\n\\nNegatives:\\n\\nThe only negative thing I can say is that the Mexican government charges tourist at every opportunity.  First, upon entering the &quot;jungle/wildlife zone&quot;.  Second, admission to the park.  And third, for a permit to use a video camera.  While the charges are not huge, they are annoying.  And since I visited the park on two different days, I got to pay each of these charges all over again!\\n\\nHelpful Hints:\\n\\n1.  If you stay in the city, you can take a mini van to the ruins by standing on the road to the ruins and looking like a tourist.  They will stop ask if you want a ride to the ruins, and charge you around 10 pesos (price 2 years ago.) to go to the ruins.\\n2.  In route to the park the mini bus will stop for the guards that are&quot;protecting&quot;(aka toll booth) the park.  You will have to pay a fee to enter the protected area (aka tourist tax - others in the minibus from Mexico, or appeared to be from Mexico were not approached to pay the fee.).  Go ahead and pay it, but MAKE SURE that your receipt has the correct date stamped, or you might get charged again.  I was given a ticket they stamped in advance from the day before.  So especially if you arrive early, make sure that you ticket has the correct date and is not a leftover stamped from the day before.\\n3.  Arrive early.  You can see the entire park in one day, but it will be a full day.\\n4.  Take a lunch break and go visit the museum.  Two reasons. First to cool off.  Second to visit the office and to ask special permission to enter one of the temples that was excavated.  Near the end of the day at a very specific time you can climb down the long staircase and visit the tomb inside for 15-20 minutes.  This is worth doing.  In order to get permisson, you will have to write a letter requesting so at the museum office.  Once you do this, they will give a limited number of tickets out to the first that come.  So take an early lunch to do this.  Be advised that this option is only on certain days, so ask in advance.\\n5.  Make sure that your hotel has AC.  In Palenque it is very hot and humid.  It is very refreshing at the end of the day to come back to a cool hotel room.\\n\\nI hope that this added information helps you in your visit of Palenque.

The style, architecture, art work, climate, everything is unique to each site. \\n\\nPalenque is what we now think of as the \\'rainforest jungle ruins\\'. \\n\\nThe air is hot and humid. The bugs love it. To be honest though, apart from them, so did we. \\nUpon arrival (after we paid parking, entrance fee etc) we were approached by a local tour guide (A few of the Mesoamerican sites have tour guides available by the entrance) who showed us a map of the area and explained that the majority of the ancient city is still in the jungle which is now protected. Only a small percentage has been excavated and, to some degree, restored/ rebuilt. He offered to take us on a two hour walk in the jungle to see the ruins as they were when archaeologists came to excavate them. Too intriguing to resist, off we went with Marco into the jungle. \\n\\nIt involved some climbing, some crawl scuttling through a mostly buried \\'house\\', some swinging on vines (because I\\'m like that!), hopping from stone to stone in a shallow river, we saw howler monkeys, various types of bird and plant life, a few ancient buildings buried amongst the trees... It was brilliant. Well worth the unexpected extra expense. (I think it cost us about \\u00a360) \\n\\nIt made exploring the excavated ruins that much more impressive. We had an extra layer of appreciation. Firstly the way they were originally built but then, all those years later, the people that found them in the jungle and then excavated and lovingly rebuilt them. Just incredible. One of the main archaeologists that worked on the site is actually laid to rest there too, you can see his tomb opposite the main structures in the site. \\n\\nPalenque is another fantastic place for any history lover to visit.

It did not diminish my excitement because I knew this would be one of the highlights of my Mexican discovery trip. I slept well and was ready to explore at the crack of dawn.\\nHaving been a part of a jungle tour before arriving at Palenque, it gave me a broader perspective of this vast site. As I entered this site as a part of an Intrepid Tour group, it is breathtaking as I viewed these incredible looking ancient buildings. The Temple of Inscriptions and the Palace is a daunting presence as it soars way beyond the vegetation in the background.\\nPalenque is an archaeological site, that is mysterious, solemn, well preserved and imposing. One has to navigate off the beaten track, since Palenque is nestled in a steamy and luscious jungle setting, rising majestically from the green grassy hills and shrouded in early morning mist. Since I was surrounded by thick jungle, it was the perfect backdrop for the Maya people who settled here in 100BC\\nWe were fortunate to have Victor as our guide who was an expert on the Maya culture and guided us for three hours, and thereafter, I explored the site until late afternoon. He informed us that the great ruler Pakal was entombed in the Temple of Inscriptions, which is off-limits to all visitors.\\nIt is a large area with courtyards, an observatory and other smaller attachments. We learnt that the findings of the Maya culture were continually changing as new inscriptions are been deciphered. At times they were a warrior people, then a kingdom of peace, and were also people of high intellectual level and produced great mathematicians and astronomers. Everything I witnessed was constructed without metal tools, pack animals or the wheel, and my mind reminisced the times when these structures were in its infancy many centuries ago. Palenque would have been majestic looking and would have taken our breath away. \\nAs I wandered around this huge arena by myself, viewing these imposing structures of Palenque, with hidden chambers, the unique water channels, inscriptions and reliefs, it made me feel so privileged and I did have enormous respect for the Maya civilisation. The unique architecture of its buildings that were constructed in the middle of this mysterious thick jungle is a testament to their superior knowledge as great builders. I remember our guide explaining about the demise of Palenque when the lower classes rebelled and did not have faith in the Gods and rulers of this kingdom. After a long period of internal warfare, it fell into steep decline, and the inhabitants deserted the city and temples, and the ever-encroaching jungle abandoned the buildings.\\nTips and recommendations: Before arriving at the main site, it is recommended to book the jungle tour, approximately US 15.00. The jungle tour involved walking around enormous tropical trees, as we crisscrossed rivers and wooden bridges while passing old Maya ruins. We also crept through hidden caves where the terrain was quite treacherous since it was wet and slippery. Many undiscovered temples and palaces are hidden from view, and this did whet our appetite for the excitement that lay ahead. Once we emerged onto the main Palenque site, it did heighten our appreciation of the mysterious dark rainforest that hid many Maya secrets still to be discovered. Since I arrived on a Monday, the Museum was closed, and this was a big disappointment for me.

Sometimes does not let pass anyone at all even if you offer to pay.\\nI went in a tour (thinking would be safer) they blocked the road very early in the morning (4:00, 5:00 am), and dont let pass the cars until 13:00. We had to take a de-tour that took us 5 hours by a hilly and broken small road.\\nTalking with the guide he said they can block by several days, and they take shifts so always a group is there to control the pass.\\nIf you want to take an aggressive position, keep in mind they come with MACHETES and if they hear something they dont like they will kidnap you. Another story of the guide: A woman was furious about the blockade she yelled at them, the local community kidnap her for 3 days and they kept the car for 3 months.\\nYou might hear stories that they do that to build schools, make better the community.\\nIm mexican so 250 per car x (minumum) 100 cars a day 250,000, you can buy the materials to build 2 houses, they have done this for years, make the math....\\nAvoid to visit then the local economy will go down and they might re-think their stance, or the government can jail these people.\\nSo you have to pay on your way up and in your way down, or de-tour of 5 and 5 hours or just sit hoping they let you pass.

The ride to the ruins takes about 20 minutes - you cannot miss it because it is the last stop. You will have to pay two entry fees: Those to the National Park and those to the ruins. Don\\u2018t forget to bring a hat, food and water because you can buy plenty of souvenirs but no food and drink within the ruins. Try to be there at 08.00am sharp (when the park opens) - both because of the heat and because if the crowds: We were there at 08.30, and there were already several tour busses arriving.\\n\\nThe main entrance is uphill, and all of the main sights are here, so if you do not want to or cannot walk so much, you can do a round trip. The Maya temples have a lot and very high stairs, so it is very exhausting climbing them - but it is still worth doing so both because of the views and because you oftenget rewarded by getting so see temple reliefs in the main altars (which are always ob the top of the temples). If for some reason you do not want to or cannot climb that many temples, I recommend climbing them in this priority (but not necessarily order): (1) Templo de la Cruz Foliada because the stairs are normal-size (so it is easier to get up and down), because it has beautiful relief and because you get one of the greatest views on the other temples. (2) The Palace because much can be seen inside and (3) Templo de la Cruz for more great views. For those who want to continue walking, you can walk downhill and see the minor sights. In any case, do the main sights first because the crowds will overflood them later and because visiting the ruins involves a lot of climbing if stairs - most people are exhausted after the main sights, so you will have the minor sights all to yourself even later in the day. If you do it by this order, you will very likely get your lonely jungle feeling (we did). You can end your tour with a visit to the museum which is outside the ruins (but can be accessed with the ruins\\u2018 entry ticket) at the lower exit. Even if you take your time, you will be likely be finished between 12.00 and 01.00am. \\n\\nAnother issue  we were not sure about is how much time to spend in Palenque overall.    Basically, I think, it is enough to time your visit to arrive in the late afternoon and then visit the ruins the next morning. Palenque town itself does not offer much more - neither concerning sights nor foodwise, and there are better places to relax. So unless you want to see further sights in the area, you can take a bus or flight onward in the late afternoon/early evening (say, after 04.00pm).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arqueologica de Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "569470103": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "One of the best mayan ruins", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d4074608-Reviews-Zona_Arqueologica_de_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The history of this place and its gobernant is remarcable, only compared to the seen in Yucat\\u00e1n and Guatemala, fron the independent mayan states", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arqueologica de Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "568969880": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Great site that seems to be relatively well preserved.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d4074608-Reviews-Zona_Arqueologica_de_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A well laid out site that allows the visitor to follow paths and signboards to gain a good insight into the history and development of the ruins and the ancient city.

We were not disappointed.  It was not easy to get here, which perhaps made the visit all the more valuable.  Fortunately, we arrived on an overcast day--so were spared much of the heat and humidity other visitors might experience.  The sprawling grounds would be difficult to navigate and interpret without a guide. It is easy to take a combi to the entrance.  There are two small entrance fees--to the national park and then to the ruins.  We requested an English-speaking guide at the entrance--and Balem hopped into our combi to offer her services.  She pitched $1200 (pesos), and when we balked she encouraged us (since it\\'s Mexico) to barter.  She came down to $800 (pesos = $40 US).  Probably could have gone lower.  She was an enthusiastic, well-informed, energetic guide who led us around the ruins, paced our visit well, and gave us a wrapup plan when her tour concluded two hours later.  (That is: go see this and go see that and then take this path down to the exit.  Which we did.)  The path down to the exit follows a stream with a spectacular cascade toward the bottom.  The museum is easy to pass up if you feel exhausted by the heat and exertion,  but it is an outstanding exhibit with excellent English placards.  Don\\'t pass it up.

The site is easy to explore with or without a guide. There were guides at the entrance who spoke some English but our 4 hour tour was more like 2 hours, and while he was very pleasant his knowledge seemed superficial and he wasn\\'t able to answer many of our questions beyond his basic spiel. I would recommend stopping at the store first (near the museum where you pay for admission) and picking up a book about Palenque, Only a small part of the site has been excavated but what is there shows a lot about both the ceremonial and everyday side of Mayan life. There are still temple sites you can climb which gives a wonderful view of the surroundings. Wear good shoes or secure sandals! As with any historical site the more you know before going the better your experience, so read up on the history before going.

The archaeological site is located quite a long way from the main entrance where you have to buy a ticket for the park only so make sure you have transport to the site if you have difficulty walking.  Here you need another ticket to visit the site.  The site, which is very impressive, is in the jungle and there are various temples as well as a palace to see. Some areas are deeper in the jungle but the main buildings are more accessible. Be aware that some of the stairs are steep and the day we visited they were slippery from rain. The most important discovery is the tomb of Pakal which is in the Temple of Inscriptions although it is closed to the public. There is a lot to see in this particular temple including many carvings and obviously inscriptions as well as a steam room and toilets. The actual skeleton and the original jewellery of Pakal are in the Anthropological museum in Mexico City but you can see replicas in the museum which is on the road back to the main park entrance.  My advice is to have a guide as you will get far more understanding from your visit. Within the site there are plenty of locals selling souvenirs,some handmade, others not.  A local tribe of Indians who live in the jungle and who are dressed in long white garments with long hair wander round outside selling such things as bow and arrows, dream catchers and jewellery made from local seeds.

He took our water bottles and filled them with delicious spring water that runs under the ruins giving them Mayan name of Lahkma - &quot;Big Water&quot;. He knew I am interested in plants and medicine and was able to show me many plants the curanderas and Mayans used to treat ailments. During the jungle tour portion he guided us though the national park outside of the ruins to an ancient Mayan bathing pool that was only uncovered 2 years ago (there\\'s still so much archeologists are working on uncovering and studying) and we got to swim in it. You could see the spring that was bubbling feeding it. So refreshing and afterwards he led us through an underground aqueduct that we would have never ever known was even there on our own. We shared space with bats and appreciated the underground ancient stone work. If you visit Palenque and want a unique experience and a guide who speaks English, ask for Edgar.

With a professional archeologist as guide, my family and I enjoyed a full day exploring the ruins of the city.\\n\\nWith their complex system of writing, chronology and ability as builders, the Mayans developed a huge city in the rain forest.  As much of the site as has been uncovered and restored, there is at least as much still buried under vegetation farther back in the forest.  Arranging for a trained archeologist to guide us around Palenque was one of the best things we could have done.  Rather than walking the site ourselves with little knowledge of what we were seeing or being restricted to the time frame of a large tour, we were able to choose our own pace, spend as much time as we wished and were treated to detailed information about the history of the Mayan people, their beliefs and customs as well as the significance of the major structures at Palenque.  \\n\\nAs a bonus, our guide was able to arrange for us to explore parts of the site that were restricted and not open to visitors.  Walking the paths and coming across small temples and mounds, still mostly covered with bushes, moss and trees made us feel as if we were explorers discovering the area for the first time.\\n\\nLearning about Palenque\\'s history while exploring the site left us with a feeling of admiration for the Mayan\\'s complex and advanced civilization.\\n\\nI do have a few criticisms or more accurately, disappointments.  Firstly, due to the tremendous popularity of Palenque, the site is too well groomed.  Palenque would have been far more interesting left in more of the original rain forest setting.  Secondly, more and more of the buildings are being closed to visitors, ostensibly to keep them from harm.  At the same time however, visitors are deprived of experiencing the full impact of the city.  Lastly, one area in the centre of the main site area is filled with vendors of local arts and crafts as well as vendors constantly blowing into instruments that gave out with  what they described as the sound of a jaguar\\'s roar.  This was most distracting to say the least and did not fit with the ruins themselves.\\n\\nEven with these accounted for, a day at Palenque should be on the priority list of any visitor to the area.  I would recommend arriving early, when the site opens in the morning the enjoy the first couple of hours free of the afternoon crowds.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arqueologica de Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "506268657": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Incredible Day at Palenque Ruins", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d4074608-Reviews-Zona_Arqueologica_de_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Bring hat, water, sunscreen, bug repellent.

I\\'d read about the road-blocks and robberies that sometimes happen in Chiapas and opted to make our way from Tabasco in the north. We flew into Villahermosa on the 18th of June and took a taxi to Chan-Kah Resort Village on the following day. There was no incident of any kind on our two-hour ride. On the morning of the 20th we hiked from the resort to the park and archeological zone. Would you believe that there are paved bicycle lanes running all the way from downtown Palenque to the park? In any event, when you arrive at the park entrance (after touring the fantastic site-museum) you can either go forward on the road (long, winding and not shaded) or go left through the &quot;jungle entrance&quot;. We chose the later. That was a great option for us. Sure, it was all up-hill on stone stairs (lots and lots of stone stairs) but we had the shade of the jungle, the company of waterfalls, and a glimpse of wonders to come. The &quot;Bats Group&quot; of ruins and the &quot;Queen\\'s Bath&quot; are not to be missed. They made it clear to us how a &quot;primitive&quot; people could have clean running water and comfortable homes. The greatest reward of the Jungle Entrance, however, is at the trail\\'s end. You take the final stairs and emerge from the jungle into the main site. The daunting presence of The Palace appears along with a few of the lesser-known temples. Only a few feet more and the Temple of Inscriptions begins to peak from around a corner. I had been concerned that the ruins would be unimpressive, but those worries were dashed to dust as we wandered through these majestic, ancient structures. They are, in fact, bigger and more imposing that I had imagined. It was 92 degrees Fahrenheit that day, with a heat-index of 104, but we didn\\'t care. The next several hours were spent exploring the temples. We were even able to go inside the Palace and look out from the t-shaped windows! We saw the cinnabar-coated tomb of the Red Queen and the intact art inside the Temple of the Foliated Cross. After several hours of wonder we walked down to the main site-entrance. Lots of vendors there, as on the temple grounds, which was perfect because we desperately needed water and wanted to pick up a few souvenirs. On our second visit, two days later, we capped-off a similar but more extensive excursion with a hike to Templo Olvidado, the &quot;Forgotten Temple&quot;. Only for the adventurous! If you want to feel like Indiana Jones for a couple up hours, just stroll down the road from the Archeological Zone until you reach Sendero Motiepa. Apply insect repellent, make sure you have good hiking shoes on, and go find Pakal\\'s first (and least excavated) construction project. We were too tired (and mosquito-bitten) afterward to walk all the way back to the resort, but we caught a ride for 10 pesos each.

Go early! The site opened at 8 am. I got there at 7:45 and was the first person in. I pretty much had everything to myself for about 30 minutes. And even after that, it was not the madhouse that some places (like Teotihuacan) can be. The ruins are extremely well maintained and in the jungle, but there are still very nice paths to walk along. There are guides at the front of the site. I am sure they are fine, but I was able to do the whole thing by myself without them. I was there in late April and while the general feeling was warm and humid, it was not over-poweringly so. Also there were NO BUGS (I did have the proper bug repellant though). Do climb everything that you can. These ancient sites are getting more and more traffic, so as the years go by, they are beginning to close access to many of the structures. Not just here, but all over. So experience it while you can. Also, many of the structures have points of interest at the top (not to mention views), so make the effort. And leave your pride at home. Some of these things are tall and have no safety rails. So if you need to &quot;sit and scooch&quot; on the way down or climb up on all fours, do it. One pointer... there are signs in Spanish and English that are all around. They are very basic, Don\\'t depend on either them or the (somewhat) confusing maps. Get an idea of the lay of the land before you go. But don\\'t let that deter you. The reality is that the site is less complicated to navigate than say the San Diego Zoo or Sea World.\\nDo take your water and a nice snack, or even a light lunch. There are plenty of places to sit in the shade and have a break. I even took a nap on an ancient temple with a view of the palace. When I woke up an iguana was basking in the sun next to me.\\nAnd do explore the structures in their entirety, as is allowed. There are clear signs telling you where you can and cannot go. Many people just sort of went up and came back down. But after going to the top of the large Palace structure I decided to come down an opposite side and lo and behold there was a small (unmarked) entrance to a series of lit tunnels that honeycombed inside the structure. Very Indiana Jones. It wasn\\'t on the maps and I was the only person inside.\\n\\nGo EARLY!\\n\\nAlso most importantly, there are I believe, 2 entrances. Do NOT go in via the entrance by the museum! If you do this, you will need to climb up a steep (but attractive) jungle path that traverses a fun suspension bridge and waterfall before you get to the ruins. Instead use the entrance at the top that pretty much dumps you right into the heart of the ruins. After a few hours, when you are done exploring all of the big ruins on top and have had your nap/snack break/iguana encounter, THEN go down the path to the waterfall and museum. It will be later in the day so walking down hill  on a shaded path to the sound of trickling water will be a welcome respite. \\n\\nAnd DO go into the museum. That is where they have the big sarcophogus (that all of us boomers saw on In Search of Ancients Astronauts. \\n\\nDon\\'t worry. You can get transportation back to wherever you need to from both sites.

The massive pyramid is part of the 90% of the ancient city that is still completely covered by jungle.  All along the primitive jungle path we could see evidence of the Mayan structure below: brief glimpses of a massive stone base, the outlines of several arches, and large stones protruding from the roots of enormous trees.  This is what the first European explorers saw when they arrived at the Mayan site in 1840, and it is almost impossible to imagine the work that went into revealing what we can see today.\\nThere is no way we could, or would undertake such a trek through the jungle by ourselves.

Few people are there at the morning and the sun color are just magical on the ruins. When you finish the ruin visit then the jungle most people go to the museum directly. Don\\'t do that.

If you are staying in Palenqu\\u00e8,  there are many tour operators that offer package trips to the ruins, as well as a short visit to other attractions in the area.  If you\\'re short on time, this may well be your best bet,  but also the most expensive. This is the DIY option.  Beware!  We met a group that grossly overpaid for a private van and tour of the ruins, (350p per person) only to find out that their payment only covered the transport costs.  A collectivo costs 20p one way, plus 30p national park fee, plus 70p ruins entrance.   A decent, authorized tour guide will cost you between 1500p and 2500p, on top of your park entry fee (30p) and your Ruins entry fee (70p).  NOTA BENE: The museum entry fee is included in your Ruins entry fee, yet the museum is closed on Mondays.\\n     So back to the original point; if you want to get there yourself, simply go to the ADO station and you\\'ll see the highway signs that direct traffic towards RUINAS PALENQU\\u00c8.   Either wait there until you see a collectivo with a sign in the windshield marked &quot;Palenque&quot; and wave them down, or start walking down that road and they will undoubtedly honk at you as they pass. \\n    Alternatively, walk towards Palenqu\\u00e8 Centro and you can find a few collectivos waiting to fill up for the short 9km trip.(20p) Once you\\'ve made it there, you will be aproached by several guides,  whom I\\'ve actually watched flip a coin to see who gets the next tourist.  If you\\'re  going to spend the money, step aside and have a drink of water, and don\\'t just accept the first guide that strong arms you as you leave your bus.  Like I said, they are not cheap, make sure you\\'re getting your money\\'s worth.\\n     As for returning home to Palenqu\\u00e8,  there are collectivos that arrive to drop off new passengers, and they always stop to see if people want a ride back.   Again, 1 way costs 20p, no more.  \\n     As for the Ruins themselves, there are many TA reviews that can help you with that.  We thought we would just clear up getting there and back.  Also, there is a restaurant beside the entrance for people  in a group that finish seeing the ruins before the rest of their group or people waiting for their tour bus to retrieve them.  Enjoy, bring water, and get ready to climb some stairs for the most epic photographs!

I first went there in 2006 and returned this month (Jan. 2017). Surrounded by the rainforest, it has a certain mystique which I haven\\'t found elsewhere.  Since the big tourist season was over, I was able to wander in peace and solitude. The first day it rained which only enhanced its intangible beauty. The second day the sun was out and the late afternoon light was absolutely beautiful. When it was time to leave, I took the path which leads to the museum and walked through the rainforest past a waterfall. You should do the same so that you can savor the jungle and its powerful presence. The museum, by the way, is excellent.\\n\\nReaching Palenque is  not easy. It has a tiny airport which doesn\\'t function most of the year.  Most people fly into Tuxtla (via Mexico City) and spend a night in San Cristobal de las Casas before catching the bus which takes five hours to reach Palenque. This is the route I took in 2006 except I spent a few days in San Cristobal. But there is a shorter route which I adopted this time by flying into Villahermosa from Houston.\\nThere is a daily 5:35pm flight  from Houston which gets into Villahermosa at 8:20pm.\\nYou can catch the 9:30pm bus to Palenque directly from the airport or spend a night\\nin Villahermosa and visit the La Venta Park (with its Olmec artifacts in a jungle-like setting) next morning before catching one of the many ADO buses to Palenque (takes 2 1/2 hours). This was my itinerary and I would recommend it.\\n\\nFrom Palenque, you must visit Bonampak and  Xachilan, the latter on the Guatemalan border. You can cover both on the same day by taking a tour bus which any one of Palenque\\'s travel agencies will arrange for about $45. Xachilan is remote, reached by bus and boat, deep inside the jungle.

The surprise to me was how big and buzzing the little town of Palanque actually was. Again, tons written about Palanque ruins, so restrict myself to only tips that might help fellow travelers:\\n\\nGetting In &amp; Out:\\n1. Flying in or out to Palanque from Mexico City. Flights operated by Interjet. Only ONCE a week - on Thursdays. (as in Dec 2016)\\n2. ADO operates overnight buses every night from Merida (and possibly other cities). We found that a comfortable option to get in early. The bus stop has clean restrooms (5 pesos) - if you want to quickly freshen up and head to the ruins before the crowds get in (around 9 to 10)\\n\\nPalanque ruins:\\n1. You can get to a \\'Collectivo\\' (shared mini bus) ride to the ruins from opposite the ADO bus stop. 20 pesos per passenger. About 10 min.\\n2. Please take a guide for a guided tour - as with  any of the Mayan ruin sites. It\\'s worth it. \\n3. Unlike the other big Mayan ruins (Chichen Itza, Uxmal, Tulum, etc) , getting guides in Palanque isn\\'t organized. There are many operators and their rates are over inflated (quote was 2400 pesos for a guided tour against a similar duration tour at Chichen Itza was for a fixed 750 pesos). We finally negotiated one for 1050 pesos. Advantage of going when a lot of other people are coming in is you can make a group and share the guide cost. \\n4. Ask the guide for a \\'history/site + jungle\\' tour.  The jungle tour part takes you to some parts of the ruins where the jungle still rules (which is 95% of the total ruins) - gives a sense of how explorers found the ruins in and also how difficult it is to uncover them.\\n\\nPalanque city and stay tips:\\n\\n1. Try and stay in the \\'canada\\' area. It is a quiet tree lined street with plenty of hotels, restaurants and coffee shops away from the noisy \\'centro\\' part of Palanque. It is also walking distance to the bus stop and also to the shopping central - Centro\\n2. Centro is the main shopping street of Palanque - and you\\'ll get plenty of food options, thingummies you may want to buy, pharmacies etc\\n\\nBit on buses in Mexico (in all my posts on travels in Mexico) \\ud83d\\ude0a\\n\\n1. Bus anywhere in Mexico is a good idea. They are cheap, safe, comfortable and are extensively networked. \\n2. \\'First\\' class buses as they call it are express buses that go from one city to another without stops. They are more expensive and luxurious than \\'Second\\' class buses that stop at an infinite number of stops along the way. \\n3. \\'First class\\' ones which we have tried to be good are ADO (in the Yucat\\u00e1n region and up to Mex city), Primera Plus and ETN (the latter two serve north of Mex City). ETN has a super deluxe service with airline business class type seating (though on one leg they were very late). \\n4. Intercity buses are from the \\'Central De Buses De Guanajuato\\' (~ 60 pesos taxi ride from the city center). Bus tickets can be bought at outlets in the city center. Some OXXO (7 Eleven equivalent) outlets sell the tickets too for a small commission.\\n5. We have been advised by a local to not book online as he has had cases when the txn seemed to go through but in the end he had to rush to get it done. (We haven\\'t tried it)\\n6. Online system does not take international credit cards.\\n7. They take international credit cards when you buy at their counters.\\n8. If you are flying in from a different country as we were, you could book as soon as you reach Mexico. Most cities have plenty of coverage and even a day or few hours booking in advance is enough. \\n9. Quick note on \\'Collectivo\\' (shared mini bus)- you can hail these shared rides for within the city. Very cheap. But no room for luggage.\\n\\nHope this helped and safe travels!\\n\\nCheers\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arqueologica de Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "447471641": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Cool", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d4074608-Reviews-Zona_Arqueologica_de_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Busy but amazing ruins.

The purpose of this review is to prepare you for some of you the confusion you might experience getting into the Palenque ruins.\\n\\nIf you are entering the park in an automobile (and not part of a prepaid tour group), you will be stop at what appears to the be the entrance of the ruins and asked to pay a 31 peso (approx. $3) fee for each person in your group. Because we had not done our homework, we didn\\'t realize that this charge was the entrance fee into the National Park itself. \\n\\nWe then drive another half mile or so to the top of the hill, park, and then arrive at the actual entrance of the ruins.  At that point we paid the entrance fee of 65 pesos per person (approx. $3.50). We found this to be a little confusing.\\n\\nBeginning at the first entrance and all the way until you pay at the second entrance, you will be bombarded with individuals who claim to be guides. Their prices range from about $5 a person to 4 or 5 times that. Many young children claim to be guides as well. I suggest waiting until you get to the actual entrance to the ruins and then inquire about a certified guide who has a photo ID stating that he or she works for Palanque. Once again the prices range quite a lot and seem to be quite subject to bargaining. We asked for an English speaking guide who charged 500 pesos ($25 total) for the 4 of us for 2 hours. He was excellent. His first language was Mayan and he other Mayan languages as well. He took his job very seriously and we learned many things that we would have missed without him. I have attached a picture of him in the event that you want to use him. His English name is Virgil. We did give him a tip, but I\\'m not sure if that is customary or not. \\n\\nIf you have not been to Palanque you will quickly realize that it is a place worth all they hype.

Beautiful setting and interesting ancient buildings.  Unfortunately most of the site is roped off so you can only see the main structures that have been restored. However, there are some things to be careful of.  First of all watch out for the guides.  They will try to overcharge you.  They offer tours of the ruins and a jungle tour. We opted for the combined tour and talked them down a bit from the initial offer of around $125US for our group of 3.  We should not have stopped at the first entrance because there are lots more guides to bargain with at the second entrance.  We should have held out for a much better deal. Also the jungle tour we had was very short, only about 100 yards and it finished a at the other entrance so we have to walk back down the road almost a mile.  The second thing is the drive.  We drove from San Christobal De Las Casas and it took  about 7 hours.  The drive is beautiful with forested mountains the whole way but the roads are terrible and there are way too many topas (speed bumps).  Some appear with no warning and we bottomed out the car many times.  There is construction on the road and we had long waits in places just north of Aqua Azul.  On the way back, we were stopped by Zapatista rebels on that same highway. They put wooden boards full of spikes in the road in front of our car and demanded 500 pesos to pass. We refused and held up a lot of traffic.  The eventually agreed to 200 pesos which we paid under extreme protest.  We also has several local women and kids stop on on the highway with strings across the road.  They were selling snacks and we refused to buy any and pushed through the string.  All that being said, it was a great adventure and will worth the expense and road problems.

No I can\\'t either.\\nSo with the hotel in Palenque 20 mins down the road take yourself forget the guided tours. If you want to know what you are looking at its all there in English and Spanish on information boards. Jump in a Collectivo parked up on the road to the ruins in front of the ADO bus station. I think it cost us 20ps each. We got there at about 9am and stayed all day.  We used the map of the site in the Lonely Planet guide. \\nHaving seen the main site, Palace, Temple of the Inscriptions, Temple of the Sun etc you must then go on down to the Museum Sitio via the waterfall and river. On the way stop off and see the ruins in the forest. Your ticket allows you to go in and out. The museum  is free and really well worth the long walk down in fact dont leave without seeing it. We then came back in and walked back up to the front entrance this time deviating via group 1 and 2 and some steep steps that come out right next to Group North. Again well worth the climb back up these steps as a much shorter route.  \\nBliss hardly  anyone at Group North and all the morning coach tour crowds had long gone so the Palace was almost empty of people as well.  \\nHave a big breakfast and take food. There is nothing to eat at the museum. I think there may be a small cafe at the front entrance. \\nDo go early. Don\\'t hire a guide unless you want to study the site. Do go to the museum. Don\\'t forget snacks, Don\\'t be disappointed to learn that most of the main part has been substantially rebuilt by archeologists. Do visit the outer buildings which are largely original. A wonderful day and having only recently also visited Uxmal Kabah, Chitzen Itza, and Izamul this was by far the best only knocked into second place by Yaxchilan but thats a day trip away from Palenque.\\nFinally you will probably need insect bite cream in the summer but when we went in November we never even saw a mosquito.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arqueologica de Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "440432587": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Impressive", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d4074608-Reviews-Zona_Arqueologica_de_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "There are a number of impressive antique buildings in this site, but amazingly, there are hundreds of other buildings known to hide in the surrounding jungle.

On the contrary, the archeological site is truly AMAZING! Very less people, magical atmosphere of the jungle and wonderful history. You can climb on most of the buildings, also you can go to see the jungle (but the tour is costly - with guide more than 2000 pesos - if you are group of people then it is ok). We took a guide in the site, they offered us the price of 1200 pesos, but we couldn\\'t afford it (I thought it will be cheaper from previous reviews, so be careful - prices are always rising!). So one lady said she will do it for 600 pesos (we were one couple). The experience was wonderful, also the guide (lady) was very kind and knowlegable. \\nYou can get easly to this place by colectivo (?). It cost 20 pesos per person and takes you direct to the site. The entrance to the national park is 33 pesos per each and then you pay for entrance to the site 65 pesos pp. It was kind of costly trip for us, but worthy. \\nWhen we were there it was very rainy in the morning, so do not forget the stuff to protect yourself - otherwise you will need to buy the rain coat for 50 pesos.\\nI highly recommend!!!

His tour was definitely the highlight of our visit. He was a licensed but not official guide. The official guides get first crack at the tourists but they do not negotiate price. The unofficial guides are self employed and charge whatever they think they can get. When times are slow rates get very flexible.

Our bus/van driver told us that most make there way down and fly into Tuxtla then fly out of Tabasco, which makes sense since Villahermosa airport is about 2 hrs. He suggested visiting the Laconda Jungle.. The drive was very long, but very well worth the trip. We did hear of the dangers in the road and the driver said that they usually drive in big groups.  Luckily we didn\\'t encounter any problems along the road.  The Ruins are breathtaking, we also had to pay a tour guide within the ruins, but our bus driver referred us to one and about $50 pesos per person.  \\n\\nFor anyone traveling, I highly recommend you book with hotel you are staying, our trip to Palenque cost $500 pesos about $30 USD.  Some of the tours I saw online were over $100 USD.  We used Osinga Tours, which was set up directly with Hotel Casa De Mama, they picked us up at the doorstep of our hotel, the 3 tours we took, we had the most knowledgeable drivers and I felt safe with their driving...They talked to us and gave us great information along the road.

It is strikingly different from those elsewhere in the Yucatan, the rest of Mexico and those we have seen in Belize, Guatemala and Peru.  The restoration work done here gives one the feel of the place without making it feel like a re-creation.  The fact that there is still active rebuilding and archeological exploration going on make it feel all the more authentic.  Its jungle location on a mountain slope overlooking the western Yucatan is beautiful. Unlike some of the other small sites (Chicann\\u00e1, Becan) we visited on the way there, Palenque is quite developed with lots of vendors and guides offering their services.  It is however not nearly as crowded or over worked at Chichen Itza and, for those so inclined, climbing in and around structures is permitted on all but two of the restored pyramids and other buildings. Also unlike some of the locations closer to the Mayan Riviera and cruise ports, most of the visitors here at the time of our day long exploration were Spanish speaking.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arqueologica de Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "338927992": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Atmospheric and special", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d4074608-Reviews-Zona_Arqueologica_de_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The weather today was awful: rain, rain and yes, rain.

But don\\'t let this discourage you from going to see the forest trail and the waterfalls. If you have the extra time and can afford the shuttle, check them out.

His tomb is resting just after you enter the park from the top entrance.\\n\\nI am so glad that the Museum and the descriptions in the park have English texts. I learned due to the availability in the English language information at various places in the park.\\n\\nI think guide would have been best but I arrived at the park much before they opened (at 8am), and I was the first person on a Saturday morning to buy ticket and enter the park. I was just me and one other visitor with bunch of vendors in the park. I got a good vantage points and solitude in the park. As I said, I loved the setup of the park. \\n\\nThis is the best site to visit in Chiapas. I felt it is bigger than the the other sites I have visited in the North. So I am excited about the Mayan sites down south in Guatemala and other places. I hear they are big and much fascinating than Palenque.\\n\\nMy favourite place in the park is the Palace and Temple of Inscriptions. The palace seems very grand and well built. Reading the details and browsing through the ruins, it seems this place was a big settlement at its peak. What\\'s more fascinating is that archeologists have discovered only 10% of the actual Palenque. There is so much discover and explore.\\n\\nIt\\'s just amazingly mysterious ruins. I am curious to know if they would discover something more in the near future.\\n\\nBest time to visit early in the morning. The park opens at 8am. Start from the top, and walk down as you are browsing the ruins. Do the museum at the end.

Both are in the middle of a lush forest where you can walk a number of trails with the feeling you are still discovering. Building are just magnificent and very well preserved.  It is a pity that you can no longer visit the tomb of King Pakal II, you are not even allowed to go up the Palace of Inscriptions, but there is plenty more to visit. Any description would be too short to describe the Palenque pre-hispanic city. Just don\\u2019t miss it. One thing I did not like is the complicity between some tour operators and the guards of the Comisi\\u00f3n Nacional de Areas Naturales Protegidas (CONANP) at the entrance of the park, who do not provide any receipt for the 30.5 Mexican pesos they get from every visitor.

We then battled past 100 guides who were all keen to give us a guided tour, to enter the site.At this point the security guard noticed I had a banana, apple &amp; orange which of course are strictly prohibited, but I was totally unaware , just wanting a few healthy snacks whilst walking around for a few hours, so handed them in to collect on departure.then we entered the ruins which are palenque.  At this point it is hard to judge if they are better or worse than Chichen Itz\\u00e1, tulum,Uxmal etc because we all have our own views, and saying this or that one is brilliant &amp; the other is terrible without giving reasons is pretty futile. All I can say is they are extensive &amp; quite stunning in magnitude. After 2 hrs it started to rain &amp; rain &amp; rain, and then it rained even more so we took cover and I noticed everyone seemed to be eating food. Not fruit, but sandwiches, crisps chocolates , so I asked if a cafe/restaurant was available on site(not expecting one) to be told no, of course not. So unhealthy junk food is ok , but fruit no ! This could be linked to seeds in apples &amp; oranges I guess but still a little strange, standing hungry in the rain watching rather obese tourists stuffing chocolate &amp; crisps inside whilst my fruit stayed at the entrance , but that\\'s life. After an hour of standing around we just carried on with our visit, just a little wetter, but we had a good time &amp; got the colectivo back from outside the entrance as soon as we left and we were back in our hotel 15 mins later all dried out.

We  squeezed into a van with narrow seats - all 12 of us, and headed for Palenque. Ok, that was not my favorite part of the tour. Especially when our van with little tire tread hit the 450 &quot;topes&quot; or speed bumps on the way there. Yup, that was painful. But like childbirth, once we arrived in Palenque and took in the grandeur of the ancient Mayan Ruins, we seemed to forget the long journey there. You take a short walk through lush vegetation to get to the ruins. Our guide tells us Palenque was built around 100bc. The first temple was for sacrifices - genital mutilation, the bloodier, the more satisfying to the Gods. The blood was collected and cooked and then used as fertilizer. She pointed out a field where games were played. The winner of the ball game she said, would be honored by being beheaded as an offering to the gods. The looser, relegated to a life of shame... We continue to another building where we climb steps and enter through a narrow passage. I\\'m overwhelmed to see an ancient sarcophagus, still intact. Our guide points out a stone slab that resembles a bed. She says Pacal, a Mayan king  in his 30\\'s and a father three children when was castrated on the slab by his mother as an offering to the gods. Gasps could be heard among the tourists. It was fascinating to hear so many tales as we wandered from building to building. It was interesting to see massive stone carvings and what could be described as a stone portrait gallery that you might find in a castle. Another crowd pleaser - ancient male and female toilets, still stained with urine. Many a picture was taken there of people squatting over the Pre Columbian squares. Palenque is beautifully preserved. As large as it was, our guide says we only saw 2% of it. The other 98% is still covered by dense jungle. The only reason the Spanish didn\\'t destroy it is because they didn\\'t see it. Palenque  was inhabited for more than 1000 yrs. Why did the civilization end? Our guides says deforestation, over consumption of resources... the crowd goes silent as we contemplate this. I wonder if we\\'re destined for the same fate. \\nRecommendation: take a good tour on a comfortable bus. Check the tires. Be warned, you depart at 5a from the hotel and return at 10p, left in the city center. Take cool clothes, good shoes, an umbrella, water, sunscreen, a small towel to wipe off the sweat. And next time, I\\'ll plan to stay overnight. 2 hours just isn\\'t enough time!

But then a fried told us we HAD to see Palenque. His passion convinced us to change our route enough to see the ruins there and we\\'re glad we did. We were instantly struck by how the ruins stand stoically in the middle of some of the lushest and most verdant terrain we\\'ve ever seen.\\n\\nOur visit was in late May, which is when the rainy season begins and heavy precip falls daily. Thankfully it rained that morning then moved on so that our 5 hours on site were dry. Well, \\'dry\\' is a relative term: this is the jungle so prepare for intense humidity, especially if you go in the summer. We come from a humid climate in the US and it was muggy beyond our standards. Plan on several hours at the site because it is really spread out if you want to see everything. Wear good walking shoes with decent grip (you can climb on most of the ruins so good soles will help). Ample water (buy it before you go at an Oxxo store or something, it\\'s pricey at the site), strong sunblock, and plenty of insect repellent are all absolute requirements for a smooth visit. \\n\\nAt the entrance you will be bombarded by tour guides offering their services and they pounce quickly. Quality differs among the companies stationed all along the parking area and I wasn\\'t aware of any &quot;official&quot; guides like they have at Chichen Itza.  We weren\\'t even offered a map by the park service. So unless you do a lot of research before going, you may want to consider hiring a guide on the site. Most of the tour guides will haggle if you balk at their initial price so give that a shot. We talked ours down by half so it is possible during the slower season.\\nWe ordinarily don\\'t hire guides at sites but we did this time. Ignacio (can\\'t remember the company\\'s name) did a good job, was interesting, and took us on a walk through the jungle as well, telling us about the local vegetation, showing us how to eat termites, and letting us taste the syrup of indigenous jungle fruit. It was also fun to see unexcavated buildings and walls in the jungle so we don\\'t regret hiring him at all.\\n\\nA lot of people visiting the ruins stay overnight in Palenque town and we can recommend that as a good way to see the ruins. Little collectivo vans with the word &quot;Ruinas&quot; in the window travel to and from the site for 20 pesos apiece all day long. They are usually lined up at the corner of Benito Juarez and Allende in the morning. Streets aren\\'t labeled well there and English isn\\'t common. If you have a smartphone or a tablet, get on Google Maps and save the Palenque map to your device so it can be used offline.

You will gawp in amazement. Go before they start stopping you from climbing these ruins. I can\\'t add any more to the other several hundred reviews about them! They are incredible.\\n\\nBut I spent ages trying to work out what to do if you were driving yourself there. So having done it, this is what I learnt.\\n\\nPalenque ruins are in the Palenque National Park (unsurprisingly!). There is one road into the Park from Palenque town &amp; it is signposted. Just keep driving up it. You will pass by hotels and when they stop you will get to a barrier where you have to pay an entrance fee to get into the National Park, regardless of whether you intend to roam through it over and above seeing the ruins. I read an older review that said you can avoid this fee if you say you are just visiting the ruins - you can\\'t anymore or at least the man taking the money said we had to pay. Full stop. (Although the Mexican visitor in the car in front got through without paying?!)\\n\\nOnce you have paid, carry on up the road. Further up the road you will see a car park and museum on your right. You can park, pay to see the ruins, visit the museum (included in the ruins entrance fee) and then walk across the road &amp; up the very steep path to the ruins taking in the beautiful waterfalls. You would then walk around the ruins and come back down to your car. But I think it\\'s best not to do it this way around. So, my advice is to keep going up the road until you come to the main entrance where the road terminates. There is parking and usually locals helping you find a space. Parking is free but whoever lynches onto you to help you park will ask for some money to look after your car. We politely declined (made sure no valuables were visible before arriving) and our car was fine when we returned.\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve parked, pay the entrance fee and off you go. When you get to the back of the site (at this point you\\'ve pretty much seen it but you can come back), you\\'ll see a pathway to the museum. Take it - the museum is worth it &amp; the walk down past some beautiful waterfalls and the odd extra ruin is lovely. The museum closes quite early (I can\\'t remember exactly but I think it\\'s 4pm) so be sure to get there with at least half an hour to see it. \\n\\nWhen you have finished in the museum, you can walk back up to the ruins (just have your entrance ticket ready to show). You don\\'t have to walk back up the long, steep path you walked down - there is a shorter path. Whist it is still a steep path, the shortcut avoids the waterfalls so it\\'s much shorter. Take it slowly &amp; it\\'s manageable. Look for the sign forking off to the right for the ruins shortly after starting the ascent. It\\'s not as pretty as the longer way down but you\\'ve seen that once (so take all the snaps you want on the way down as you won\\'t be walking back past it)!\\n\\nIf you really can\\'t face the walk up and you\\'ve finished in the ruins, you can just stand at the side of the road outside the museum &amp; cabs or collectivos will stop &amp; give you a ride back up to your car for a fee.\\n\\nWe drove from Becan, leaving just after 9am and got to Palenque at about 1 - 2pm. This was enough time to wander casually around the ruins, get to the museum before it closed and get back into the ruins &amp; out before they closed. Also, the crowds must have dwindled as it wasn\\'t too bad. We had no intention of taking extra walks in the National Park - you would need a whole day if this is your plan.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t take a guide, just read up about the site beforehand. There are plaques written in English giving you basic details of the structures so we found those along with some prior knowledge was enough and we could go at our own pace.   \\n\\nOne final tip, if you stop to refuel at the station at the end of the National Park road (if you turn right, you\\'ll see the station on the right). Watch out for a scam - one fills &amp; another chats to you to stop you looking at the pump and the amount of fuel going in. We asked them to fill it up but the man filling stopped at 100pesos and asked for payment. We said no, full please &amp; the chatting man keeps chatting making sure you don\\'t look at the pump. At the end, the filling man asked for 100pesos from the \\'first\\' filling plus the new total on the pump which was 200pesos, so 300 pesos in total. But based on the fuel in the car he couldn\\'t have reset the pump after 100pesos, simply carried on putting another 100pesos in so a total of 200pesos went in but he wanted 300pesos. Because the chatting man had distracted us from watching the fuel pump, we had to pay what they asked for. Another station in Cancun tried this trick but by ignoring the chatting man and making sure the pump was reset after the first filling, we didn\\'t get caught out again.\\n\\nI hope this \\'essay\\' on visiting the site by yourself helps other independent travellers - I might be biased but IMO this is the best way to see these outstanding ruins.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arqueologica de Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "196581374": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Allow tons of time - ideally split over two days", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d4074608-Reviews-Zona_Arqueologica_de_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The site is gigantic and I didn\\'t expect such extent, variety and beauty.

The park is really well maintained and organized, clean -- lots of people visiting, mostly domestic visitors when I was there. Climbing the pyramids is great for the extraordinary views, but eventually they will have to prohibit it, since so many people are coming.  The museum on site is really great.  I think they should do more sculptural and relief copies of the original to install, if they can determine the original positions and sites -- it makes the experience more meaningful.

You only need to buy the 57 peso entrance fee. My suggestion is to tell the guy at the gate when he tries to make you pay that you are only going to the ruins. \\n\\nWe also noticed some guards early in the morning hassling one tourist. They were laughing and blowing whistles at him. Later we saw the tourist and asked what happened. Apparently, a guard tried to throw him out of the park for walking up some stairs that had no sign saying you couldn\\'t walk up them. Bottom line: BE CAREFUL IN THE MORNING OF CORRUPT GUARDS.

The guide I had was selected by my Intrepid tour guide, and happened to be one of the archeologists there, who took us into a roped off section to visit a ruined dwelling - so beautiful, nestled in the jungle, with trees towering on top of it. \\nListen out for howler monkeys as you walk around!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arqueologica de Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "157548095": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "So beautiful!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g249851-d4074608-Reviews-Zona_Arqueologica_de_Palenque-Palenque_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I stayed in Mexico for three months, during which I had the chance to see many ruins, some of them very well-known and visited, other less touristic but even more amazing. Palenque is visited by very many people, but there I found the best ruins I have seen in Mexico. I suggest you take a one-hour tour in the jungle with one of the young boys who offer their guiding. I was skeptical but it was worth it, they only asked 100 pesos and I was so happy that I ended up giving him the double (which is not a lot anyway).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arqueologica de Palenque", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/c3/d4/67/palenque-ruinas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Palenque", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}}
