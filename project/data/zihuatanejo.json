It certainly is no Hawaiian Island resort.   The town itself is not particularly pretty or nice, and it is rough around the edges, including the hotels along the different beaches.  We stayed at Aura Del Mar, which we have really enjoyed.  The beach on here at first glance, is average, not white sand, not big, some litter, but it really does grow on you, and we did never ventured far from our beach, enjoying body surfing (perfect waves for the beginner), boogie boarding, and some people learning to surf.   I think part of the appeal for me, is that this is not a Hawaiian style resort (which I do enjoy as well), mainly Mexican tourists (June/July for us, so low season for snow birds), and so. feels like we are actually in Mexico and not some generic all inclusive resort.

It did feel a little bit empty at times and some of the best-ranking restaurants were closed (but plenty were open). \\n\\nAbout Zihua itself: a great place to go for a relaxing beach vacation. It does however lack some soul - a week is more than enough, if staying longer do research beforehand on daytrips (take care, Guerrero countryside can be dangerous). \\n\\nIt is more touristy than some other places on the Pacific like Puerto Escondido. The bay is very beautiful with its thick forested rolling mountains - you absolutely must visit at least one of the restaurants overlooking the bay for a sunset dinner. The village itself, not too beautiful in our opinion. It was created for tourism and has nothing on other Mexican tourist towns in Oaxaca, Guanajuato, Chiapas or Veracruz.

The snorkeling wasn\\'t that great because of the cloudy water at the time of our visit but the island had beautiful beaches, cold beer and margaritas, clean bathrooms, shade and excellent service. His boat was small but comfortable (with shade) and We brought towels, water and our own snorkel gear. Moses charged us $20 USD per person and the island restaraunt charged $5 USD per person to prepare the fish and add beans and rice. All in all a fantastic day at a killer price! Highly recommend!

He sold us on a fishing trip for two the next morning for $70 per person. He said he would take us out, we would have a great time, catch fish, then go to Las Gatas beach where someone would cook our fish for $5 and take us to Manzanillo beach too. Ok. We met at the marina as instructed but Moses was not going to be taking us out, his brother and son were. Hmmm? Okay...not what we bargained for but we\\'ll go with it. Moses bought us water and beer as promised and took us to the boat and off we went. We had a lovely time with his brother and son who took very good care of us. We caught 5 mackeral and 2 black tunas. I got sick after that so we went to manzanillo beach where I thought I\\'d be able to sit on the beach for a bit. It was a coral reef and getting to the beach was hard. So I floated in the water and at first felt better, but then got really sick again and needed to be on land. So Moses\\' son swam me out to the shore, where we sat there for about 15 minutes chatting while I caught my bearings. I felt better. We swam back to the boat, and headed for Las Gatas beach. When we got there they tried to charge us more than what Moses pitched to us. I explained we were told $5 and that I wasn\\'t eating because I was sick.(they were not happy about that). Our fish also fed our crew for free. I had a cup of rice which they charged me $2.50 for. Everyone ate a feast but me. The beach there is nice, calm and pretty but lined with restaurants and chairs. If you stay at the beach, go all the way to the end, away from the crowd to the coconut tree grove and hang out there. It\\'s peaceful and shady. (probably not during high season though). We then left after everyone ate and we went back to the marina. By 2pm we were back at our hotel, where we chilled the rest of the day. We tipped the crew $25 (we didn\\'t know what to tip) and one black tuna. All in all, it was a tourist trap, but we had a nice day. I would recommend doing it once for the experience. The boat we were on was small and old (we were promised a nice boat with GPS tracking, etc.- yeah it had none of that!) I think if we were on a bigger boat  I wouldn\\'t have gotten seasick. Advice- ask many questions, don\\'t give anyone any money until you arrive at the marina (no deposits), know what you are paying for, and you\\'ll be okay. Also, I say go for the big game fishing if you really want the experience (sailfish, yellowfin tuna, marlin).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zihuatanejo Bay", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/5b/f1/1c/zihuatenjo-mexico.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "205725207": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Charming", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150795-d1421735-Reviews-Zihuatanejo_Bay-Zihuatanejo_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/5b/f1/1c/zihuatenjo-mexico.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We visited Zihuatenejo Bay while on a Mexican Riviera cruise.

Ixtapa is a planned community, developed in the 1970\\'s by Fonatur, much like Cancun.  Whereas Cancun has taken off like a house on fire,  Ixtapa\\'s growth has been slow to develop which we consider an asset as the community continues to retain the ambience of a true Mexican community.  Zihuatanejo is occupied primarily by Mexicans.  Although tourism is clearly evident, there is still very much a Mexican vibe.  Working with United Nations, this community is not simply a beach destination, it is a \\u201cCulture of Peace Community\\u201d, where all segments of the population are working to instill basic human values throughout. While we can\\'t speak toward any official peace-loving status, we can certainly attest to the basic kindness and genuine interest in the wellbeing of the tourists that we have experienced on each of our visits.  Although English is not widely spoken, the desire to connect is strong; all you need to do is demonstrate a little interest.  We have learned much about the community simply by interacting with everyone and anyone.  If you would like to read more about our experiences, check out my blog post, http://hpdsinc.blogspot.ca/2013/03/how-i-spent-my-winter-vacation.html.  \\nZihuatanejo International Guitar Festival http://www.zihuafest.info/:\\nIf you have followed our travel experiences, you will know that, in 2012, we opted for a spontaneous trip (as in booked it Thursday and arrived Saturday \\'spontaneous\\') to Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo.  We are music lovers and, as I cruised various websites, I stumbled upon the Zihuatanejo International Guitar Festival (ZIGF).  That first year, we caught about half of the festival and we were so impressed that we returned for the entire event in 2013.  Although we couldn\\'t possibly see ZIGF delivering the same level of service and quality of music two years in a row, we were dead wrong.   With a combination of repeat performances and new musicians, we were just as wowed.  We love the host community, the informal venues--usually open air restaurants and beach--and the music. . . well, what is there to say except that one rarely has opportunity to experience so many world class musicians at such a ridiculously low price, in such an awesome setting.\\n\\nShortly after fundraising for the 2014 festival began, Eric and I made a conscious decision to sponsor ZIGF.  We are not, by any means, wealthy people; we are your average, everyday working class, middle income couple that saves up for each and every holiday.  We do, however, try to support activities within and outside of our community, that we feel has a broader benefit.  ZIGF met our criteria; it operates on a shoestring budget; relies heavily on volunteerism; and it benefits the broader community.  Not only does ZIGF have a loyal (if small) group of followers, it continues to bring new people to the lovely City of Zihuatanejo.  The Festival hosts a school concert where community children are introduced to music and the world of guitars, and interact with the musicians, as well as a public free concert for everyone to enjoy.  \\nFundraising proved to be a bit more of a challenge this year; in fact, sufficient funds were raised only 23 short days prior to the Festival.  In that time, a goodly chunk of change was raised; the musicians confirmed; accommodation and venues booked; and all the little extras that must be addressed (permitting, licenses, food &amp; beverage venues, sound, seating, etc.) were attended to.  Suffice to say, for the third year in a row, we were, once again, not disappointed. To show our support, we joined a group of nine to become the Festival\\'s inaugural \\'Founders Club\\', entitling us to a few extra perks such as access to all venues and galas, inclusion in the Musician\\'s Welcome Dinner and reserved front row seating at the Opening and Closing Concerts.   This year, the evening concerts were held on beautiful Playa la Madera, while galas were interspersed amongst several of the area\\'s popular restaurants.  We also made a purchase of a guitar, handmade by fine Paracho luthier, Fernando Ganzales, and signed by all the musicians.  In Mexico, it is not unusual for skills to be passed down through multiple generations.  What makes our guitar special for us is that it is the first guitar Fernando constructed with his son.  It was a great honor for us to have them sign the guitar as well.\\nAlthough the festival suffered a small shortfall, it was successful enough to draw the attention of the State, which recognized the event as an opportunity to continue attracting visitors to the community.  The dates for the 2015 Zihuatanejo International Guitar Festival have already been set to run March 6-15.  We haven\\'t actually booked our return, let\\'s just say, there\\'s talk. . .  and we will continue to support this wonderful little event in any way that we can.  If I have sparked your interest in any way, shape or form, here are the questions you need to ask yourself:  are you a lover of great music of all genres?  Does the vision of being serenaded by world class musicians, on a world class beach, in a world class destination do anything for you?  Let\\'s add the intimacy of small venues where everybody seems to know your name. If the answer is yes, to any (or all) of these questions, you owe it to yourself to check it out; we are confident you will have no regrets.  The Zihuatanejo International Guitar Festival has both a website (above) and Facebook page if you want to keep yourself abreast of its progress towards next year\\'s event.\\n\\nIf I see a missed opportunity anywhere, it is for ZIGF to find a way to get the word out.  We did our best to spread the word on the our plane; but we talked to many people who were not aware that such an event was going on in the community during their visit.  This is not an easy task but I know the Festival is working hard at raising its profile.\\n \\n\\nTouring Zihuatanejo:\\nWe learned many years ago to spend as much time as possible elbow to elbow with the group leader of any guided tour.  While each guide may have a \\'canned\\' presentation, they are a huge well of knowledge about the area which they are more than willing to share if one shows the interest and asks.  I happen to be a bit of a history buff and have a strong desire to understand the culture we are imposing upon.  No doubt, you have seen people like us on other tours.  We are the ones that run to the bus so we can get the seat right behind the driver.  When we don\\'t have our noses flattened against the window, we are plying the driver with questions.  It\\'s amazing what one can learn. . . but you do need to ask as your escort will be careful not to get in the way of your personal experience and we each have different needs.\\n\\nOn our first visit to Zihuatanejo (often referred to as Zihua), we had the immense fortune of connecting with one of the best guides we have ever been privileged to travel with.  What sets him apart from his colleagues is, he is not only passionate about his country and his community, but loves its history as well.  If he senses you have an interest, he will take the time to explain cultural innuendos and various landmarks regardless of their significance.  He is somewhat akin to a walking encyclopedia on every subject that has a local implication, from plants and wildlife to archeology and architecture, to culture and religious importance. Believe me, we have tried!   If you have been blessed with an enquiring mind or you just want to be sure you are travelling with someone who will take very good care of you, is fluent in English and truly knows what he is talking about, we highly recommend you contact Miguel Martinez at saldivar66@gmail.com.  We were so impressed that we have kept in touch, used his services on each of our visits, and are honored to regard him as our friend.  I assure you, you will not be disappointed.\\n\\nIn previous visits, we explored the beautiful neighbouring state of Michoac\\u00e1n, well known for its abundant craftsmen.  We visited, Paracho where guitars are built; Santa Clara de Cobra (copper); Patzcuaro, which is architecturally stunning and located in a beautiful setting, the Paricutin Volcano and the nearby village of Angahuan.  An unexpected highlight of that particular trip was when Miguel wrangled us an invitation into one of the local homes  Not only did they provide us with a tour, we sampled their food, came away with a gift of tea leaves, picked and dried in the hills.  We were able to help them out by purchasing their handmade items that they would otherwise have sold in the street.  This was a very cool day for us, completely instigated by Miguel. \\n\\nWe will, one day, return to Michoac\\u00e1n, but we thought it time we explored our host community, Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo.   Prior to the 1970s, economic activity was based on fishing and agriculture.   Today, almost 3/4 of the population is engaged in the tourism sector and, with the lag in this sector over the past few years, you can only imagine how this has affected the local economy.   Geographically, the area is mountainous and rugged; much of the developed area hugs the shoreline or is situated in the foothills of the Sierra Madre Mountains.  As we explored the local area, Miguel would often take the time to orient us, referring to a particular beach or community as being \\'just over that hill\\'.  It became a bit of a standing joke for us that everything in the area was \\'just over that hill\\'.  Visit, and you will get my drift.\\n\\n We provided Miguel a couple of ideas of what we might find interesting and then we were off.  First, we headed for the village of Barra de Potosi, on the lovely Playa Blanca, for lunch, making a quick stop at Playa Larga, a 15 km stretch of unspoiled sandy beach.  Barra de Potosi is a fishing community of about 600, located on a large lagoon, where it meets with the ocean.  You can pick up a tour of the lagoon, a large mangrove estuary teeming with wildlife; go on a fishing adventure; or, as we did, simply enjoy lunch at one of the many beachside restaurants and stroll the beach.  There is a laid-back vibe to this little village, right down to the hammocks suspended between the tables, just in case you need a little \\'after dinner\\' siesta.  One can look across the inlet and see a restaurant located on a small jetty of land.  During the dry season, the lagoon recedes and one can walk to the restaurant but, when the water is high, access is by way of boat or a bit of a swim.  While one might think this a bit of a deterrent to patrons, we not only witnessed people swimming across but, even from a distance, one could see a good number of customers.  This beautiful beach has also attracted its share of ex-pats who, I am happy to report, have not only been well received by the local community but contribute to the community by lending support to the school and teaching English,  not to mention, frequenting the local establishments.  We would seriously consider staying here as there is a variety of accommodations and places to eat.  I would be remiss if I didn\\'t also mention this community is also home to the highly regarded El Refugio de Potosi, a private, not-for-profit ecological conservation initiative promoting conservation, preservation, education and research.   \\n\\nBacktracking toward Zihuatanejo, is the community of Petatlan.  It\\'s downtown district is built around a church located atop a hill, said to be a ruin.  Friar Juan Bautista founded the first church here in 1555, however, it was destroyed by an earthquake caused when the Paricutin volcano erupted, some 350 miles northeast, in 1943. The present church was constructed in 1949, badly damaged by another earthquake in 1985, and repaired in 1990.  It is dedicated to Padre Jes\\u00fas de Petatl\\u00e1n who\\'s sculpture of the Christ, located inside the church, is considered to have produced many miracles. Petatlan is a regional pilgrimage site, particularly visited during Holy Week, by as 30,000 people.\\n\\nEarlier this year, I stumbled upon a blog post about a replica of the Greek Parthenon located on Playa la Ropa, Zihuatanejo and I wasn\\'t going home without at least trying to get in to see it.  As it turns out, the guards were kind enough to allow us to wander the premises at will, provided we offer up a small token of gratitude to the caretakers.  Dubbed the Palace of Corruption, El Partenon y el Negro Durazo was a vacation home of Arturo &quot;El Negro&quot; Durazo, a Mexico City Police Chief who successfully converted his police force into a racketeering empire.   Although his salary could never have supported his habits, he acquired two palatial homes, a collection of vintage automobiles and properties in both Canada and the U.S.  Durazo amassed a fortune in illicit wealth from the bribes paid by every cop in the City, the cocaine trade, and kickbacks.  The law eventually caught up with him; he was apprehended while \\'on the lamb\\' in Costa Rica, jailed for several years, and his properties confiscated.  Due to ill health, Durazo was granted a $3M pesos bail in 1992 and released, having completed 6 of a 16 year-sentence.  He died in 2000 at the age of 76.  Rumour has it, his ghost keeps watch outside the massive front gates.  If true, he didn\\'t bother us and, perhaps, was thankful for the company.  If nothing else, you have to admit, it makes for one heck of a story.\\nEl Partenon is truly something of an architectural if somewhat garish sensation.  With dozens of roman sculptures, and frescos, reportedly imported from Italy, this 4-bedroom 5 bath home quite literally screams bordello, right down to the mirrored ceilings of each bedroom.  Besides the front yard swimming pool, and outdoor entertainment area, there is a large cage where Durazo is reported to have kept a pet lion; what appears to be a parking structure; and staff quarters, complete with outdoor cooking area sufficient for preparing copious quantities of food.\\n\\nGuerrero State eventually claimed the property which was gifted, in turn, to the local university, in hopes that it could be reclaimed as a local community treasure.  We understand this acquisition is wrapped in red tape and litigation so it\\'s unclear what the outcome will be.  Although not exactly on the official roster of \\'Things to Do and See in Zihuatanejo\\', if you are even remotely interested in architecture and folklore, or just want to subject yourself to perhaps the most stunning views of Playa la Madera you will ever experience, it might just be a highlight of your excursion.  Personally, it\\'s these unexpected little gems that totally make my day.\\nWe continued about 30 minutes north of Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo to Troncones. Known for its many miles of unspoiled, virgin surfing beaches, Troncones is home to about 500 people.  The village includes a school, church and cemetery, in the Mexican fashion, as well as a few stores offering basic necessities.  Reportedly, until only a few decades ago, the area was completely undeveloped; one man built a home and today, the beach is lined with large vacation homes, many available for rent.  There is no public transit; cab fare is about $75 US one-way.  I suppose beauty is in the eye of the beholder but, for all I have read about this area, I admit some disappointment.  While the beach is truly beautiful, nothing but the beach represents \\'real Mexico\\', although that\\'s often what one reads about it.  \\nHeading south, back toward Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo, we stopped at Playa Linda, home to a beachside RV park, condominiums and resort hotels. The area is frequented by locals and tourists alike and is supported by public transportation to Ixtapa Commercial.  There is also a 5+/- mile walking/bike path between Playa Linda and Ixtapa, where it is easy to connect to public transportation or cabs into Zihuatanejo.  Patio chairs, tables and beach umbrellas are available for rent at la Langosta Loca, which also provides free showers to its beach customers.  Playa Linda is also where you can catch a boat to Ixtapa Island which, we have been told by many, is an absolute \\'must see\\'.  The Habitat Natural de Cocodrilos provides viewing platforms where you can observe crocodiles, iguana, turtles, and several species of birds, including pink spoonbills.  For the most part, the sanctuary is fenced off from the public but make no mistake, away from the public eye, these critters are free to roam.  Though we have yet to see a crocodile in the wild, there are many signs warning of their presence, particularly in the vicinity of golf courses.  That would certainly make searching for lost balls a challenge, wouldn\\'t it!\\nOur excursion with Miguel was approximately 8 hours long and we loved every minute of it but you can make it what you want.  His vehicle is an 8 passenger SUV so there opportunity to share the expenses with others; we just enjoy hoarding him ha! ha!\\nI truly hope you have found the information I\\'ve provided useful or, at the very least, entertaining and informative.  I\\'m a huge supporter of information sharing.  I like to read about the travels of others, in hopes of learning something new and discovering a new destination, if only in my imagination.  Sometimes, I\\'m inspired and make an opportunity to check their destinations out for myself.  I encourage you to share this information and provide feedback, whether you find yourself motivated to visit any of the mentioned sites or you have a differing opinion.

At our lunch stop, there was a couple sitting at a table, sipping drinks, and just basically enjoying the quiet, and I can certainly see doing that. Lunch for 3 cost me less than 500 pesos, so it\\'s a bargain, too. Halfway through lunch, most of the restaurant staff came running past on their way to the water, evidence was that there were fish along the beach and they had handlines and lures to fish with, we saw one Jack Crevalle caught.

Other reviews for this beach area seem spot-on; it\\'s a quiet spot with a very long beach, spectacular to watch the waves pounding away on shore... Several visits but still the surf has been too powerful for us to brave the waves... but great to watch.  There are a number of small hotel-restaurants along this part of the beach, a few seem to do a brisk business on the weekends.  We recommend \\'Agua Azul\\', run by a great family, a fellow named Miguel is the owner.  It\\'s not often you hear a local resident of a tiny coastal town in this region tell you &quot;Oh yeah, I used to live in Winnipeg&quot; when he hears you are from Manitoba, Canada.  Shows what a small world this is!  You\\'ll find Agua Azul about 100 metres south (turn left) of the main road that enters this town.  Their meals are simple and inexpensive, and the service is excellent.

Fortunately I found out you could walk into town and catch a small mini bus every few minutes that would drop you off at the road that goes down to the beach. From there you can take a short ride in the back of a small truck with bench seat to the beach. Total for both rides was 13 Peso\\'s! The beach itself has some of the nicest waves that curl in at 6 or 7 feet in an almost perfect crest. If you go for a walk good luck trying to get from one side of the beach to the other its a huge area to cover! We walked for 1 1/2 hours and didn\\'t come close. A few good places to eat on the beach but far less amenities than the beaches inside the bay. That said my girl friend and I found a small spa where they had beds to lounge on and a pool, a bartender who made a mean Margarita and some decent fish taco\\'s so we were set.

This is an amazing project and we spent a very enjoyable couple of hours here.  We saw turtles, huge and multiple iguanas, coatamundi, snakes large and small, the gorgeous macaws, the porcupine, spiders, insects, and many other birds of prey.  They have constructed an amazing panoramic tower which affords wonderful 360 views of the surrounding estuary, lagoons, and nearby ocean beach at Barra de Potosi.  This project is truly educating tourists and locals alike, attracting buses of school children who will benefit from the things they see and learn here, as well as people who have brought injured wild animals here for medical help.  Whenever the Refugio can rehab and release a bird or animal, they will.  If the animal or bird is unable to fend for itself in the wild, it will remain at the Refugio as an &quot;ambassador&quot;.  Volunteers staff the walking tours and I imagine you could hear different stories and impressions from various volunteers each time, so I\\'d definitely return here again.  And I found some cute gifts in the gift shop!  A woman named Laurel Patrick is the director of this refuge, and we had the opportunity to meet her and learn more about the creation of the refuge and its work.  I\\'ll be excited to see the skeleton of the large sperm whale once it\\'s reconstructed.  We could see the work being done on this mammoth whale...quite impressive.  I think the 60 peso admission (approx. $4.75 USD) is extremely reasonable.  I will note, we rented a car, and had the freedom to visit nearby Petatlan with its amazing Church of Miracles, gold market and great BBQ chicken eateries; the La Chole museum near the Soliedad de Maciel ruin; and after visiting the Refugio, we had time for a snack and a dip in the ocean at Barra de Potosi\\'s La Contesa Enramada (a lovely beach cafe with tables, chairs and hammocks for your siesta!)

At only 3 years old, this refuge will obviously grow to be a substantial sanctuary for the wildlife of Mexico.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "El Refugio de Potosi", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/0c/0c/c3/el-refugio-de-potosi.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Camino Los Achotes a Barra de Potosi", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "40880", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "128329539": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Paseo por el  refugio potosi", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150795-d2149491-Reviews-El_Refugio_de_Potosi-Zihuatanejo_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/0c/0c/c3/el-refugio-de-potosi.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "this is the best place for enjoy your vacation on this area is very natural expereince  whit animal and birds", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "El Refugio de Potosi", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/0c/0c/c3/el-refugio-de-potosi.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Camino Los Achotes a Barra de Potosi", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "40880", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "128284319": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "amazing wildlife refuge", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150795-d2149491-Reviews-El_Refugio_de_Potosi-Zihuatanejo_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/0c/0c/c3/el-refugio-de-potosi.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Near the beach at Barra is an awesome wildlife refuge that features animals from the region, such as coatimundi.

This access route may be a little challenging for some, but the beach is, more usually, very easily reached by a small flotilla of boats leaving nearly continuously from the main boat dock in Zihuatanejo. For 50 pesos per person round trip, you can have a 10 minute fun ride across the bay to reach this beach favored heavily by locals. As you walk from the Playa Las Gatas docks along the beach, you will pass many restaurants, each of which will have lounge chairs, cushions, and shading umbrellas freely available - with the promise of buying drinks and a meal sometime during the day. The iced drinks, we were told, were all made from purified water, and the ice  brought to this beach, so we enjoyed some very flavorful pina coladas. Most days we arrived in the late morning, and except on holiday weekends, were easily able to get \\u201cfront row\\u201d beach seating. We enjoyed late lunches at both the Restaurant 3 Palms and Restaurante Oliverio, and found the bacon wrapped shrimp to be a treat, but also enjoyed the seafood stuffed fish. Beers were 30 pesos, cold, and served with a plate of lime slices. We were very pleased with the prices, particularly given that not only were the lounge chairs free, but also a large table adjacent to the chairs was made available for the day for eating and holding our bags and beach items off the sand. \\n\\nI also rented snorkeling gear and paddled out beyond the break water a few times to enjoy observing the plentiful and brightly colored fish. I was taken with the variety and quantity of fish, but some of my friends observed that the visibility is limited to 20 or 30 feet due to sand picked up by the wave action. Another way to snorkel is to join one of the entrepreneurs who have large boards an inflatables available for groups to hold on to and be escorted out beyond the breakwater. The bay was relatively tranquil on the days I visited, and the swim was short, so I \\u201cself-guided\\u201d my own experience. \\n\\nThe one downside of the beach is that the sand yields to a more rocky bottom about 10 feet out from the shoreline, so wading needs to be done in waist deep water - or one needs to transition to swimming (or snorkeling) to be more fully submerged.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa Las Gatas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/11/99/7c/playa-las-gatas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "651139310": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Snorkling, swimming and lots of Restaurants.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150795-d154096-Reviews-Playa_Las_Gatas-Zihuatanejo_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/11/99/7c/playa-las-gatas.jpg", "datePublished": "February 9, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We went to Las Gatas after a big catch while fishing.

We spent most of the day there for about $45 US. I had payed attention to how many beers and checked the menu for prices.  When Franco brought us the bill it was exactly right!  He got a good tip!

I normally do not recommend a group snorkel tour, but I can say that it would have been helpful in this case, as the group I saw was much easier for boats to see than one snorkeler on his own.

It\\'s a 15 minute walk from the resorts on Playa La Ropa, or a five minute boat ride. The beach is sponsored by a collection of restaurants that have beach lounge chairs, tables umbrellas etc. You use their chairs and they keep you lubiurcated and fed throughout the day. Our favorite location is Otilia\\'s which is at the far end of the beach as you hike in. There is a trail that runs from the south end of Playa la Ropa. I recommend that you wear sneakers and take your sandels or water shoes as the trail can be a little rough. A full day of drinking and eating for four adults will run you about $2,000 pesos ($110) for beers, cocktails and a hearty lunch. The boat ride back is about $200 pesos ($11) for a group of 4). The staff is friendly and very attentive. I recommend taking cash.\\n\\nTake note that the beach is sandy but walking out into the bay requires water shoes as the bottom is a combination or rocks, gravel and coral debris. Depending on water conditions, the snorkeling is decent, lot\\'s of tropical on the inside of the breakwater.

It has calmer waters due to the rock barrier allowing for great snorkeling, swimming, and just straight chilling in the water with your chair. Part of why it is so awesome is the adventure getting there and the whole idea that you are isolated. \\n\\n#1 - You can walk here! During lower tides you walk from the end of La Ropa beach - follow the road for as far as you can towards Las Gatas - then hop down a path to the rocks. You must have good balance &amp; overall fitness, but it is a fun \\'hike\\' with great photo opportunities. When staying at the Bambu Tree House  - I usually hike in the morning and then take the boat back to downtown in the afternoon. \\n\\n#2 - Walk the beach before you pick a spot (&amp; pick one near the end of the beach). This is a good general rule of thumb, but at least you know what is available before you choose a spot. I usually end up towards the end of the beach where it is quieter. \\n\\n#3 - Carlo Scuba - best spot to rent your snorkels and flippers. Great spot for PADI dives as well. Will hold your belongings while you snorkel if you wish. \\n\\n#4 - Avoid weekends/holidays. I\\'ve seen this spot over-crowded with tourists &amp; Mexicans alike.

There is a big statue of Jesus Christ (Jesus De Cristo) there is you swim our far enough or get dropped off (in this case by jet ski).  You have to dive about 10 feet or so to see it but it is the most beautiful and magnificent thing I have ever seen.  \\n\\nThere are restaurants all the way down this beach and they want you to buy food from them to use the sun chairs.  Otherwise, you can walk down towards the other side of the beach where the surfers go.  Also very beautiful and cool to see the surfing up close!  There you may lay out your towel and sleep on the sand.\\n\\nThe water was turqouise and but the bottom has reef.  You can swim out a little bit towards the boats parked in the water and stand on sand.  \\n\\nThis place is your corona commercial experience!  12 beers for 10 bucks, excellent guac and ceviche...\\n\\nThis place is a must see if you are in or near Zihua!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa Las Gatas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/11/99/7c/playa-las-gatas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "333577897": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Family friendly beach in Zihua", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150795-d154096-Reviews-Playa_Las_Gatas-Zihuatanejo_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/11/99/7c/playa-las-gatas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We visited Playa Las Gatas in 2010 with a 4 year old and again in 2015 with a 18 month and 9 year old.

I imagine it can get busy on weekends so best to go weekdays or early in the morning for a good spot. There are also massages available there. If you are staying on La Ropa, you can walk the short rocky trail from the south end of the beach near La Gaviota Restaurant, to Las Gatas Beach. It takes about 15 minutes. There are a couple spots where you need to use your hands to support yourself climbing over rocks, but we were able to do it with a baby in a backpack and a 9 year old, no problem.

The cost was 12 pesos each , same on the way home . A walk down the road , for a 10 minute walk at about 9 am to the pier . Cinco de Maya is where the flea market is . When you get to pier your will notice a number of shops , and they are worth a stop on your way home. Great coffee shop !  Cost to the island was 40-50 pesos ? I think, was not a lot in any case . They give you a ticket for your return ride home , don\\'t lose that. You can walk to the island from the end of La Ropa beach  , as long as you have good foot ware and have no mobility issues.\\n\\n Arrived around 930 am, and went directly to Otila\\'s . The ever charming Franco greeted us , and directed us to some beach front chaise lounges and a table . We did not find any of the other restaurant owners to be aggressive as we had heard in other reports .\\n\\nGot in some early snorkelling , and would suggested you go out beyond the man made reef , as the sea life is far more abundant . Was not able to locate the statue , but neither was the guide who was ahead of me taking people out , so I did not feel so bad . Did several snorkelling excursions throughout the day . Water was quite warm. Met several folks from all over Canada and US , and some who had been coming for years. I always like to pick their brains for places to go and see for future trips. \\n\\nNext up was lunch of coconut shrimp and chips and guacamole . All delicious . Frank checks in on you regularly and was not pushy . \\n\\nThis was Monday and it was quite quiet until about 2pm , which was not a bad thing . I had heard it was much busier , but guess we got lucky .  \\n\\nWe headed off the island at 4 pm, and were back at pier by 415 pm . Just enough time to stroll along the pier and shop areas .\\n\\nA fun filled day , which I would highly recommend when visiting the area .", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa Las Gatas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/11/99/7c/playa-las-gatas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "252801156": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nice calm water", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150795-d154096-Reviews-Playa_Las_Gatas-Zihuatanejo_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/11/99/7c/playa-las-gatas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "If you go on a weekday and not the weekend....absolutely peaceful and quiet beach to enjoy.

However it is the Pacific Ocean, and given the broken arm and maimed faces on adults we saw, we decided to take our children, 4 and 8, to a beach where they could play freely.\\nWe took a quick, inexpensive cab ride(90 pesos) to Zihua and then a taxi type boat for a few pesos more.  Although my wife had a little trepidation I did point out the bag of life vests and the drivers were obviously experienced so after a short hop across the bay we disembarked.\\nWe walked along until we reached a restaurant that actually had open beach chairs, which to my surprise, there was no charge.  We did have a table behind it and promised to purchase lunch and drinks.  I had to talk my wife into  the Dorado but soon after people started bringing in their own, which seems to be the norm and assured her of the freshness.

Franko (he\\'s been mentioned in other reviews) greeted us and was a FANTASTIC host. The guy has been doing this for decades and knows how to treat customers right - there when you need him, not too pushy, great conversation at times - but still he lets you relax and soak in sun and surf all the same. \\n\\nThe lunch and drinks we had were very good (coconut shrimp, fresh toptopos, salsas, cervezas, a ridiculously ornate pina colada (in pineapple)). The sun angles were lovely and the views across the bay were as well. We are not snorkelers, but we enjoyed the warm waters for occasional soaking and splashing - all in all spent about 5 hours here in the most relaxing way.\\n\\nThe only demerit I give (why 4 stars and not 5) is the beach itself is LOADED with coral and sharp rocks, both of which make wading with shoes or sandals a MUST. We met a group of 4 who almost turned around and left on the first boat back to town once they tried going into the water. We were OK, but only after being shown a \\'clearer\\' path, one with alittle more sand than rock. So be prepared...\\n\\nOtherwise, enjoy the sun, the gentle surf, the uncrowded beach (there were relatively few vendors strolling and hawking their wares) and look for shady palapas and good service such as we found at Otilia\\'s.\\n\\n\\u00a1Salud!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa Las Gatas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/11/99/7c/playa-las-gatas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "151132450": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Great little beach, lunch at Otillia", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150795-d154096-Reviews-Playa_Las_Gatas-Zihuatanejo_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/11/99/7c/playa-las-gatas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Ask for Franko....great waiter.

Some people absolutely love it while others like ourselves feel it is just okay.  It is a small white sand beach that you either walk along the shoreline from La Playa Beach or take a boat taxi from the marina in Zihuat to get to.  It is lined from one end to the other with restaurants that have their beach chairs out front.  It was slow when we were there so every single restaurant had their \\'sales person&quot; out front giving you their pitch to eat and drink at their place.  Drinks are reasonable, but your options for food run a bit higher than over at La Ropa.  The chairs are on a slant, so I didn\\'t find that so comfortable.  It felt crowded to me and that was in low season so I can\\'t imagine what it would feel like to me in the height of the season.  The water can be murky or clear depending on the day.  You have to be careful walking into the water as their is rocks in most spots.

(Read trilinearmipmap\\'s comments for additional info).\\nThe beach is anything but a white sand (as one guide book described it) calm, quiet get away.\\n\\nCurrently, it costs 35 pesos (standard &quot;street&quot; exchange rate is 10 pesos to $1and you can pay in either dollars or Pesos) round trip to take a water taxi to Las Gatas.  Keep the second half of the ticket; you\\'ll need to give it to the taxi &quot;driver&quot; on the return trip.\\n\\nHaving caught one of the first taxis of the day, everything was calm and quiet on the trip over and upon arrival but it was clear once the beach was in sight that we would be one of many that day.\\n\\nThe first thing that strikes you is the mass of colored umbrellas that occupy in the neighborhood of 80+% of the beach.  In general, each color denotes a different restaurant/snorkel gear rental/gift shop.\\n\\nWe initially walked over to the now closed (has been for over 1 year according to the locals) Las Gatas Beach Club (although some of the bungalows may still be available to rent, there is no club/restaurant) to watch the local surfers.  No pressure and as we found out later, no charge for the chairs.\\n\\nAs more tourists and locals arrived (word to the wise, the week after Easter is a traditional break week for the locals so domestic travel increases greatly during that time) we decided to find a place on the beach and enjoy the morning; we had no intention of staying all day.\\n\\nWe found a couple lounge chairs at the first establishment on the far end of the beach (it was something like Armandos, remember the White umbrellas and avoid) with white umbrellas and were greeted warmly.  We couldn\\'t sit in the chairs we wanted (apparently they were reserved) but eventually settled down and ordered a couple drinks.\\n\\nAs it happened that day, the water had been particularly high and our host said that he felt the snorkeling wasn\\'t going to be good that day.  I was impressed at his honesty...it wouldn\\'t last.\\n\\nWe lounged for roughly a couple hours.  During that time, many, many more tourists kept piling on the beach as more water taxis arrived.  At one point, there was a line of 14 taxis waiting to unload in addition to the local boats arriving and anchoring just off the beach.  There were so many anchored boats; you had to dodge them, and keep an eye on them in case they shifted, to get to water more than waist deep.\\n\\nSpeaking of the water, it\\'s not very clean and far from clear.  If you\\'re planning on walking more than 3 feet into the water, bring some form of foot protection, the beach is very rocky under the water and it\\'s not fun at all with bare feet.  (Yes, one of us gave a little blood).\\n\\nDeciding we wanted to beat the rush off the beach and see a little of Zihuantanejo we told our host we were ready to leave.  Then came the big news, there is an &quot;assumption&quot; that if you occupy a chair you will also order lunch (if he mentions the lobster and tuna tacos one more time...).\\n\\nIf all the chairs were full and we were preventing business, I might understand, but maybe 8 out of 20 were occupied and there were still 2+ hours until &quot;lunch&quot; was going to be ready (we kept being told that it wouldn\\'t be ready until around 2pm).\\nNeedless to say, this didn\\'t make us happy.  Had he stated it up front, that\\'s one thing, but when only one party in this relationship knows the &quot;assumption&quot; and the other doesn\\'t, it\\'s complete BS.  Clearly, we weren\\'t in the States, but if I ran my business like that, I\\'d be run out of town.\\n\\nWe elected to leave, any shred of an appetite was gone.\\nAs we made our way along the little strip of sand (dodging people, rocks, etc.) between the water and the pricy lounge chairs, we licked our \\u201ctourist\\u201d wounds and vowed never to return.  Clearly, there is information out there about this lovely practice, but we only had our travel guide and the time and interestingly enough, it didn\\u2019t mention the chair fee.  Although it did described white sand, calm waters, and the great beach for kids.  All statements I would consider inaccuracies.\\n\\nTo add insult to injury, after we loaded into the water taxi for the return trip, the boys (who I don\\u2019t believe are staff of the water taxi organization) demanded a tip.  Fortune would somewhat smile as the taxi driver quickly pulled away from the crumbling concrete before I could react.  Besides, there would be plenty of other opportunities that day, 12 taxis were waiting to unload.\\n\\nThis was by far the worst experience of our time in Ixtapa/Zih.  and strongly encourage you to spend time and money elsewhere.  One recommendation would be Isla Ixtapa.  However, the snorkeling side of Isla Ixtapa has a feel just like Las Gatas with all the chairs, umbrellas and people, (not to mention a very rough coral beach) but if you wander about 20 yards behind that beach, you\\u2019ll find a much more tranquil experience next to calm water and the chairs don\\u2019t cost a Peso.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "1"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa Las Gatas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/11/99/7c/playa-las-gatas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "14508254": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Playa Las Gatas: avoid at all costs", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150795-d154096-Reviews-Playa_Las_Gatas-Zihuatanejo_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/11/99/7c/playa-las-gatas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "My wife and I went to Playa Las Gatas last week and it was an extreme disappointment and waste of time.\\n\\nWe took the boat across the harbour, the boat ride was pleasant but that was the only nice part of the trip.\\n\\nOn arriving at Playa Las Gatas we found that the entire beach was taken up by restaurants which had set up lounge chairs for their patrons.  There was no part of the beach which you could use if you were not a patron of the restaurants.\\n\\nWe had intended to have a couple of cold drinks at a restaurant, then go swimming and snorkeling, then have lunch after a couple of hours.\\n\\nThe first place we tried demanded $45.00 (not pesos) for the privilege of sitting in their lounge chair to have a drink.  This was the red umbrella place that one of the other reviewers mentioned.  We were advised that either we order a full lunch, or pay $45.00, or leave.  We weren\\'t hungry yet as we had just finished breakfast.  We moved on to the next restaurant which demanded $20.00 per seat.  The third restaurant was the same.\\n\\nAlthough we are well off and can easily afford these prices I have a strong objection to being ripped off.  We passed on the restaurants and took a walk down the beach.\\n\\nWe noted that the water was a filthy yellow color with lots of foam pollution floating on top of the water.  There were many boats anchored along the beach blocking the potential swimming even if it weren\\'t for the foul looking water.  To put the finishing touch on this masterpiece, a mangy smelly dog sauntered down the beach rooting into garbage.\\n\\nWe beat a hasty retreat back to the pier and took the boat back to Zihuatanejo.\\n\\nThe rest of our trip to Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo was wonderful.  All of the people we met on our trip were nice to deal with, vendors and restaurant staff were polite and treated us fairly.  Las Gatas was the only place where anyone tried to rip us off.\\n\\nIn summary we were absolutely disgusted with our trip to Playa Las Gatas.  Do not waste your time going there.  Instead go to Isla Ixtapa.  We had a wonderful time there including have chairs and table set up 10 feet from the water and being served lobster and drinks without any hassle or pressure and certainly no shake-down for money for a lounge chair.\\n\\nPlaya Las Gatas for us fit the ugly stereotype of a nightmare Mexican vacation spot.

It is very difficult to walk there, besides being a long walk, the last part of the walk involves walking on a rocky section of shoreline. The best way to get to Playa Las Gatas is to go to the municipal pier in Zihuatanejo. You can walk to the pier from Zihuatanejo or take a taxi. If you are in Ixtapa, you can take a bus to Zihuatanejo or a taxi. There is a ticket booth at the very start of the pier. Ask for a ticket to Las Gatas. It is very inexpensive. Remember to keep the stub for the return trip. Walk down the pier a bit and you will see the water taxis lined up. Board the water taxi - there will be people there to help you into the boat if needed - the steps down are a little steep. The boat (actually, the water taxi is called a &quot;panga&quot;) will take you across a bay, around a point and drop you off at a pier at the far north end of Playa Las Gatas. You can walk south down the beach. There are a number of wonderful restaurants along the beach. You can choose one and simply spend the day there. They will make a breakfast for you, serve you snacks, appetizers and beverages all day and make a wonderful lunch for you! The fishing charter captains often take their fresh catch and bring it to the restaurants there, so if you enjoy seafood, you can have fresh mahi-mahi or whatever you desire! The prices are lower than in town for both food and beverages. The previous poster mentioned Franco and his restaurant (Otilio\\'s). That happens to be the restaurant I go to on Las Gatas. However, you won\\'t be disappointed in any of the other ones.  The beach is very nice, the water clarity is good. There is some snorkeling available there, however I found the best snorkeling spot has the strongest current, so I recommend snorkeling only for strong, experienced swimmers. Carlos\\' SCUBA is located on this beach. Carlos\\' shop is a PADI certified shop and offers great SCUBA diving for certified SCUBA divers. The most popular trip costs about $75 US. The shop also offers lessons for begining divers. \\n\\nOnce you have selected a place to hang out for the day, just sit and relax, go swimming, have some refreshing beverages and enjoy your meal! Toward evening or perhaps even late afternoon, pack up your gear, pay your bill and head back to the pier and catch a water taxi back to the Municipal Pier in Zihuatanejo. I travel to Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo and I would never miss spending a day on Playa Las Gatas.

The sand here is very fine, which makes for some good walking and a firm base when in the water, but it also gets stirred up easily, making the water a little murky. There\\'s not a lot of room on the beach but enough when it\\'s not the busy season. There are a few restaurants and shops here, and when we visited there were two women offering massage for a very reasonable price. One nice thing here is the almost complete absence of wandering beach vendors. There is a pretty nice paved beach walk at the base of the bluff the hotels are built on. The middle of the beach is nice for swimming/playing in the water, it slopes gradually and there are no obstructions. Like all the beaches on Zihuatanejo Bay, it\\'s pretty well protected but there are still waves enough to play with, at times body surfing or boogie boarding are pretty good. I don\\'t know if people throw more trash on this beach, or if it\\'s just that this is where the waves and currents drop the trash, but I did find myself often stepping on trash, mostly crushed plastic bottles or bits and scraps of wood, but once I felt a sharper edge and found I was standing on a torn and crushed aluminum can. The ends of the beach are more rocky and you have to be careful as there are broken oyster shells stuck to the rocks, it\\'s easy to step on them when walking in the shallows and they will cut your feet badly.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa La Madera", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/bf/0d/37/logo.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "561153097": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Quaint and lovely", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150795-d153755-Reviews-Playa_La_Madera-Zihuatanejo_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/bf/0d/37/logo.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We really enjoyed this area of Zihua.

When you choose your accomodation i can highly reccomend larger terraces rooms even it they are a bit more expensive you may end up living in it most of your stay.  Plenty choices for coner stores, great for snaks all along Adelita st. restaurants and beach coctails one block away at the most.  All residents are tourism friendly almost everyone speaks english and are happy to give directions.  I spend a month on winters there and love the athmosphere.   I stayed at the first place on the hill, called &quot;a room with a view&quot;,  my last great found, clean and spacious, there is everything i need for a month\\u00b4s stay away.   Locals swimm in this beach and net fish by the evenings,  but tourist prefer La Ropa beach, even though it is the same it has more development and infraestructure it turns out more expensive for same things and items compared.

It is only a 50 peso cab ride from almost anywhere in the City, and it is a great beach.  The plus, and the minus, of this beach is there is a LOT going on.  There are lots of beach vendors, lots of people, but there is also a lot to do.  Good restaurants, great beach massages at an affordable price, and very good swimming in a safe environment.  If you want a little more beach action for this City, Playa la Ropa is a good place to go.  Not a &quot;high rise&quot; place like Ixtapa, but plenty to do.  This is very casual, so think relaxed.  If you are not staying in the Playa la Ropa community (there are beach front and upland places to stay), it is still worth a taxi ride trip for a few hours just to stroll the beach, and have a snack and a beverage.\\n\\nIf you want a fun eating experience, try La Manglar.  This is within view of the beach, and has a path to the beach, but it is set in a &quot;jungle&quot; next to a creek in which there are alligators, and the iguana will come down and walk amongst the tables.  It is very safe, but a fun experience having a three foot long iguana stop by and visit near your table.  The food is tasty and fairly priced and it is kid friendly, but also romantic if you are just a couple.  I gave this a 4 star rating, as I prefer a little more laid back beach activity (try Madera Beach for that experience), and it is a little far to walk to the center of Zihuatanejo, particularly if it is a warm day.  However, it could easily be a 5 star for someone that likes a lot of beach activity and you are renting a car so you don\\'t plan on walking any further than the beach!

Since it is in Zihuatanejo bay the waves are significantly smaller than at Ixtapa. We were also struck by how clear the water is. People were snorkeling in several places.\\n     Numerous restaurants and hotels line the beach, and we took advantage of several during the day and evening. If you commit to buying some food from them the restaurants will let you use their lounge chairs or tables. There is also a stretch of palapas available to rent for under $5 per day.

When I arrived there on tues March 15th it was about the most relaxing peaceful place out of any beach on the planet. The water was warm, the waves were just big enough to make a wonderful crashing sound. The sand is smooth and zero coral or rocks in it. Your not too overwhelmed with the vendors. The restaurants and bars are all great. Paty\\'s was my favorite. I stayed on the beach at Villa Mexicana for the first 3 days, and Hotel las Azucenas. Villa Mexicana was fantastic for the price. $115 a night with ocean view and breakfast.  You can\\'t beat that. There were quite a few sting rays in the surf. They like to ride the rip curl of the waves. They are quite curious and friendly little creatures which didn\\'t seem to post any danger. It just takes a little getting used to. \\n\\nNow the bad.  DO NOT plan your vacation anywhere within a week of any mexican holiday.  Mainly Easter or Christmas. Our nice quiet laid back beach when we got there turned into complete mayhem. There had to be 20,000 + more Mexicans that arrived by Saturday due to the Easter holiday. It only got worse as the week went. The whole country pretty much gets 2 weeks off for Easter.  Ixtapa/Zihuat is the closest destination from Mexico City.  You are over run by the locals. I saw zero issues with them nor did I have a problem with it. It\\'s just kind of annoying because there are so many. They all have 10 kids so you pretty much hear screaming kids all day. The place is out of control and very busy.  It is their country and they all seem much happier than Americans. I just learned a lesson. Get the hell out of there a week before Easter. Anyone would love this place. Just don\\'t be there around any Mexican holiday. I gave it an excellent rating because it was my fault for the only downfall. \\n\\nI didn\\'t experience it, but I read that this place is quite polluted and nasty waters if your there during heavy rains. The canals all drain into the bay. I\\'d stay away from rainy seasons around here.   \\n\\nWill I come back here?  Absolutely, but nowhere near any Mexican holiday or rainy season.

However, swimming at Playa la Ropa is wonderful because it is sheltered from the Pacific by a relatively small opening into Zihuatanejo Bay.

We moored in the calm waters no more than 100 feet form La Ropa beach and dove off the boat into the calm waters. It was a great day. A couple of other times, my wife and I just went to La Ropa for a day to swim because she would never go into the ocean in Ixtapa.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa la Ropa", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/1a/e5/65/la-ropa-beach-from-the.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "250137544": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Stunning beach", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150795-d153646-Reviews-Playa_la_Ropa-Zihuatanejo_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/1a/e5/65/la-ropa-beach-from-the.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Lovely calm beach with many restaurants.

Often the ocean is very calm, just like a mirror, sometimes it has waves that break on shore and are not dangerous but are fun. The main problem here are sting rays lying on the sand very close to the shore: if you step on them, they\\'ll sting you. They start being more plentiful January onwards: shuffle as you go into the water and try to be where other swimmers are; that\\'s what I do! Water sports are plentiful and very affordable: from paddle boarding to the new flying board, they have everything and this is a perfect beach for all those activities as there is no coral to hurt you if you fall, nor sharks to worry about. There is snorkelling in the area, both at the end of the bay and at Playa de las Gatas, just around the corner from here. Patty\\'s Restaurant is our favourite: never had a bad meal here and we\\'ve been going to this restaurant for 2 months, almost every day for lunch and often for dinner as well. Beach loungers are free if you consume, service is excellent and management is the best: to there first! Elvira restaurant next door to Patty\\'s is also reputed to be good, but we haven\\'t tried it after disappointment at La Perla Restaurant at the end of the Bay.

I appreciate it even more now that I have two young children as it is easy to get to, the kids have a good time and I can relax.  \\n\\nThe beach is amazing. Low waves, no major undercurrent, sand is soft and fine and the water is warm.  You can\\'t go wrong with this place. .. \\n\\nWee get thee at 9 amish, which is a great time to get great seats.  We usually stay until 4 pm.\\n\\nHere\\'s the scoop on how to make it a great day.\\n\\n1. What to take...especially if you have little ones.\\n- Bring your own towels, a water spray bottle, change of clothes, snacks and water.  A tip - get a ziplock back and put in a wet wash cloth with some extra water in it.  You will find this handy to wipe your face/of the kids after a swim in the water or when they get sand in their eyes.  Few locations have showers and even if they do, there is limited water, so you can\\'t count on water.  This when a wet towel and a water spray bottle come in handy.\\n\\n2. Getting there and to where?\\n\\nMy favorite spot is La Perla restaurant. All the cab drivers know where it it is.  If you are coming from ixtapa it is a 15 minutes can ride and as of Nov 2014 the cost was 140 pesos.  They will drop you off at the restaurant.  Take the cabbie\\'s cell phone number, but there is no need for the dab to wait for you.  There are always cans in the parking lot or you can call the same cabbie later if you need to.  You can always ask the folks at La Perla to call on your behalf.\\n\\n3. La Perla \\nIt is a restaurant on the beach front. It is clean, great bathrooms (although very poor water pressure in the sinks). The food is fantastic,  and there are plenty of seating areas.  If you want beach chairs, it will cost 50 pesos for a table, and two beach chairs (reclining/upright). These are available by an independent vendor, but they are out in front of La Perla. One other benefit if you are traveling with kids is that they are willing to store milk, snack and any other refrigerated items for the kids.  I always bring a few milk boxes and fruit, and just keep them in their fridge. The kids always nap right on the beach so I can give them their milk after lunch and they are set.\\n\\nMy favorite dishes there are the huevos rancheros for breakfast! and for lunch I always get the huachinango al mojo de ajo (red snapper in a garlic rub that is grilled). Their fish is fresh and brought in daily by the local fishermen. They have other fish which are also very good, but the kids an d I are partial to the snapper.  Also, there are other ways they will prepare your snapper - in a chilli sauce, with tomatoes and chillies, etc.  The other options are sometimes a bit over powering, so I stick to the garlic/butter treatment.  For snacking we always do guacamole and the fresh coconuts. Prices are pretty good.  Fish is about 200 pesos (the fish can be shared.  It is very large)v guacamole is about 80 pesos and the drinks are pretty standard price.\\n\\n4. Music man\\nYou will see plenty of men with guitars walking around.  Have them okay some wonderful songs for you.  If you are visiting, request these..\\nCielito Lindo, Mexico Lindo y Querido, De Colores and La Bamba.  They charge $100 pesos for three or four songs.  You\\'ll love the serenade and it helps the local economy of independent workers.\\n\\n5. Other activities:\\nThere are many vendors who walk the area - someone who does braids, someone who sells hand woven bags, others who sell hammocks, shell and bead jewelry, etc.  I always get something ... Gifts for friends  and family, and items for myself. The handicraft market in Zihuatanejo has very similar prices and you will want to head there for more deliberate and serious handicraft, clothing, traditional craft shopping. The vendors at La Ropa have some nice things and again, even buying something as small as a 20 peso. Bead bracelet or a. $150 pesos for a hand woven basket goes a very long ways for these local vendors. \\n\\n6. Massages -\\nRight next to La Perla are two open air, but tented massage spots.  It\\'s hot and feel pretty sticky, but they do a good job.  I always get one. Can\\'t tell you how great they are as I usually fall asleep.  Or hour is $200 pesos (about $18 US dollars). One treat for your toddler...I always ask to shorten my massage by 15 minutes and massage my little girl for 15 min. She loves it and gets so relaxed that she falls asleep just in time for nap time. And for nap time, I just set some towels under the coconut trees for shade and the kiddos are out for 2 hours.\\n\\n7. The bad?\\nThe only complaint I have is no showers, but we\\'ve gotten around this. I usually ask for a plastic cup I can fill with water at the sink or use an empty water bottle that I would have ordered at the restaurant and fill with water (again really low pressure to even wash hands well at the sink). I\\'ll step off to the side in the parking lot and use that water to rinse the kids\\' faces/body if they get too prickly etc. It takes a couple of refills, but we make it work. If they had showers (and mainly because of the kids) I would give La Ropa 5 stars.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa la Ropa", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/1a/e5/65/la-ropa-beach-from-the.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "237472138": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Just stunning.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150795-d153646-Reviews-Playa_la_Ropa-Zihuatanejo_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/1a/e5/65/la-ropa-beach-from-the.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Relaxing, beautiful and fun.

Some of the restaurants/bars along Playa la Ropa will charge you to rent an umbrella and lounge chair, others loan them out for free as long as you eat/drink at their establishments. Food/drink prices are reasonable. As we are both retired now, we are headed to Zihua in early October to live there for 6 months.

I have been to Cabo, Puerto Vallarta, Bucerias, Sayulita, and Desaladera on the Pacific Coast.  It is long enough and flat enough to walk on.  The water is crystal clear (except when the waves churn up the sand), there is lots of green background.  It is not ruined by overdevelopment (not yet anyways). There is some beach activity such as parasailing, banana boat rides, kayak rentals, catamaran rentals, and sea dos (sp?) but not so much to ruin the quiet. After years of going to Mexico, my husband and I finally tried parasailing.  We went with the guys that are right next to Rossy\\'s (prenounced Rosie\\'s). Very safe, reasonable and so much fun. \\n\\nThere is no blaring music.  There are some people selling their wares, but not too many.  In fact, we were intrigued by some of what was on offer and did buy some food stuff.  Would have bought the purses and hats if we were in need of some.  If the little man in a white shirt comes along with his peanuts, buy some. They are good. We also tried his pistachios.  We tried the churros from another vendor.  Not as good as when they are made fresh on the spot, but that didn\\'t seem to stop us from devouring them. We also tried the peanut brittle from a young man and it was the best I have ever eaten. Most vendors don\\'t speak english and my spanish is not so good, so we went with the point and smile method which worked very well.\\n\\nThere are several restaurants to choose from.  The great thing is that if you buy some food and beverage from them, you can use their lounge chairs, table and umbrellas. Our two favorites were Patty\\'s and Rossy\\'s.  So many places in Mexico, you have to rent your chairs and then pay for food and drinks on top of that.  Only one restaurant charges for chair rental, but it is only 50 pesos for the day, for two chairs, a table and an umbrella.  \\n\\nI hate writing about this beach as I don\\'t want it to become ruined, but I think it is a long way off from that yet so enjoy!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa la Ropa", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/1a/e5/65/la-ropa-beach-from-the.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "124250674": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "La Ropa", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150795-d153646-Reviews-Playa_la_Ropa-Zihuatanejo_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/1a/e5/65/la-ropa-beach-from-the.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "La Gatas beach is exquisite.

The water is protected and there aren\\'t any strong undertows or currents to endanger swimmers. It is a great, safe place to bring children to play in the water. The beach offers many restaurants and places to lounge. Toward the south end of the beach is a restaurant El Manglar. There is a small outlet from a lagoon next to the restaurant where Zihuatanejo\\'s &quot;most-photographed&quot; resident lives. The resident is a 10 foot crocodile. There is a sign which &quot;warns&quot; about crocodiles being present. The staff at El Manglar feed the crocodile during the day, and the event has become quite an attraction. The crocodile does not endanger the swimmers, you will understand what I mean when you visit the area. There are many other very nice restaurants along the beach. If you are inclined to spend the day on the beach, most restaurants will allow use of their chairs and palm-thatched &quot;umbrellas&quot; (or palapas). The restaurants will charge a small fee and expect you to order food and beverages from them during the day. You will find the meal prices reasonable, the prices of the drinks are comparable to prices you would pay at a restaurant in the US. There are also several hotels along the beach. Masseuses have small canopies erected at several places on the beach, and you can have a wonderful hour-long massage for about $15-$20 US. Vendors are not plentiful on this beach, however there are some available. The vendors sell everything from little kites to woven blankets. They are polite and are not intrusive - if you are not interested in what they may be selling, simply say &quot;no, gracias&quot;, and they will not bother you. They are polite and attentive.  The view of the bay is wonderful. I recommend this beach.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa la Ropa", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/1a/e5/65/la-ropa-beach-from-the.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Zihuatanejo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}}
