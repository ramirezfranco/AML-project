You can do the same, in fact, its cheaper than  having a tour company pick you up at your hotel. All you pay is for the guided boat trip that lasts about 3 hours and is worth every peso !!! We both paid 200 pesos per person  which is about $11.00 dollars each.  Not bad, for a &quot;three hour tour,&quot; (sounds like Gilligan\\'s Island !!) Anyway, the company is called &quot;Turistica del Grijalva&quot; and ticket agents at the main plaza will show you where to purchase the tickets and take the bus to the river, (all included in the price, by the way) You have to put on a &quot;may west&quot; and get in a boat with about 25 other tourists. Our boatman, Francisco was great !!! He told jokes and gave interesting narratives about the flora and fauna, legends, and geological formations over a loud speaker. And yes, we did see crocodiles, spider monkeys, ducks, cranes, and hawks circling high above thousand foot cliffs. It\\'s mysterious and stunning. The tour is all in Spanish, but don\\'t let that discourage you. Read up on Sumidero or check it out on the internet before you go and you will still enjoy it. In fact, there was a Dutch family in front of us and they seemed to be enjoying everything just like the rest of us Spanish speakers.

Can be enjoyed from below (by boat) and from above (by car). There are day tours for each location, departing from Tuxtla Gutierrez (main city). Both visits are recommended. For the limited budgets (like me) though, those tours are kind of expensive, ranging between $75 and $120, per tour. This is what I did...\\n\\nFor the boat tour, there is a local bus stop in Tuxtla, between the 11th and 13th Streets (SW), right on Avenida Central Oeste. Take there a bus to Chiapa de Corzo. Ask the locals for the right bus number. The cost is: $.025 per ride. Get off at Chiapa de Corzo\\u2019s Main Plaza (takes about 20 minutes). On arrival walk towards the docks, looking for the Park\\u2019s Service Station, where you can buy a Park Access wristband for $2. Don\\'t pay for a boat ride there (they will sell you out). Instead, look for boat services all the way to your right (facing the river). Look for boats color either blue or red. The more you walk to the right the cheaper. Those boats charge about $5 for a guided 2-hour ride. Super tip: If you are a fisherman (I am), for about $10 (well bargained) a local fisherman (you will see their boats all the way to the left) would take you fishing on the river, for half a day. You should buy the Park Access wristband anyway, if you want to do both things (fishing and touring). Return by bus, same way. Total fee: $11. DO NOT THROW AWAY THE WRISTBAND (you can use it to enter the Park, the next day, for free). If you arrive early in the morning at the docks, you may have time to visit the nearby waterfalls. There are day tours for hire at the Main Plaza, off the docks.\\n\\nFor the Cliffs (next day). Take a public, shared taxi (&quot;pecera&quot;), on Avenida Oriente Norte (between Avenues 2a y 3a (NW)). It will take you, in about 20 minutes, right to the Park entrance (on the mountain side). Ask the locals, or the driver, for the right car number. The Cost is $0.75, per ride. Super tip: At the gate, ask anyone driving into the park for a lift (the Park rangers would not let you just walk in). Get straight to the top (most visitors go there anyway), so you can visit all the trails in your way down (easier). This is a half day visit. There is plenty of wildlife to watch.

I enjoyed pulling right up to the resting crocodiles on the bank of the river .  The whole slow paced day trip took about 7 hours from San Cristobal .  We utilized a guide service .  Don\\'t go all the way to San Cristobal and miss this National Park.

Dense foliage above from enormous old trees, and many little streams, ponds and waterfalls around the paths, provide a delightfully cool microclimate.  In addition to all the featured animals of Chiapas in their enclosures, a myriad of wild animals: deer, howler monkeys, great curassow birds (like wild pheasants) and agouties (guinea pig-like rodents the size of chihuahua dogs), have decided to make this zoo their hang-out. If you go in the late afternoon you will often encounter herds of deer ambling about the walkways as the howler monkeys roar overhead. \\nWhile some of the animals seem to have insufficient space to move about, most of them roam freely between rocks, trees and ponds in large enclosures. The otter (nutria) is a treat to see as it leaps and cavorts in its pond.  There is a special viewing area where you can sit and watch it from below the surface of the water. This otter obviously enjoys showing off for its human audience--I only wish it had a mate, as well. \\nThe information written outside the enclosures, in English and Spanish, is fascinating but unfortunately many of the signs are missing or misplaced. Still, they teach you a lot and prick your curiosity to go search Google for the missing details. \\nThis place is absolutely Tuxtla\\'s best defense against global warming, and if you still have energy after you stroll all around the grounds for a couple of hours, the Ecological Reserve El Zapotal is right next to the zoo, with more waterfalls and swimming holes in the rainy season under the enormous native trees.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zoologico Miguel Alvarez del Toro", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/35/86/a2/esta-si-que-es-linda.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Senor del Pozo 242 Cerro Hueco", "addressLocality": "Tuxtla Gutierrez", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29094", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "358042976": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nice zoo, good for families with children", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g317142-d534094-Reviews-Zoologico_Miguel_Alvarez_del_Toro-Tuxtla_Gutierrez_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/35/86/a2/esta-si-que-es-linda.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Nice walk through wooded area.

The Zoo is in the forest, completely shaded and it\\'s a nice 2 hour walk to see everything.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zoologico Miguel Alvarez del Toro", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/35/86/a2/esta-si-que-es-linda.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Senor del Pozo 242 Cerro Hueco", "addressLocality": "Tuxtla Gutierrez", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "29094", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "121783527": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Decent zoo but overhyped in LP", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g317142-d534094-Reviews-Zoologico_Miguel_Alvarez_del_Toro-Tuxtla_Gutierrez_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/35/86/a2/esta-si-que-es-linda.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is another one of those Lonely Planet headaches.

It was annoying because I did this after Canon de Sumiero. A canon tour is 200 pesos roundtrip, but to do it solo costs 180 pesos plus another 100 pesos in collectivos. It\\'s more expensive without the tour. I did this just to go to Zoomat, which ran about another 100 pesos in taxis and collectivos and 60 pesos to get in. So in other words, I really expected more.

Weekend evenings the park is packed with elderly couples, families with small children, dapper middle-aged men and groups of young secretaries just off work, all gathered together to hear the expert marimba bands that play in the ornate ironwork kiosk. The atmosphere is festive and carefree: everyone can dance, whether alone, in pairs or in a little group, and when you are too tired to dance anymore, you can watch the others.  There are some amazing dancers, including old couples who have learned to move together gracefully through 50 years of marriage, and there are little babies who can barely stagger to the beat. Some of the participants are beautifully dressed, some are wearing flip-flops and baggy shorts, and some indigenous women in their traditional dress are selling their crafts around the edges of the park.

Whether you travel clockwise or counterclockwise from Tuxtla,  every day is a beautiful and exciting adventure that will leave you wanting to either explore even further, or return another time to see what you may have missed on your trip that you didn\\'t allow enough time for.  This area of Mexico offers far more than I could ever have imagined and I highly recommend doing a little homework before you plan your trip to Chiapas and make sure you allow enough time to just explore and enjoy the beauty that this area of Mexico has to offer..  And, then also consider visiting Oaxaca, the next state to the West.  I haven\\'t seen it yet, but I\\'ve heard it\\'s also absolutely awesome.  Enjoy!!
