This is a beautifully natural area, with lots of trees, hills/mountains, natural springs, rivers, waterfalls and hiking/climbing. We drove on well paved roads most of the time, and traffic was very sane; no issues with driving. The places we visited that we recommend are \n\n- Cascades de Tamul; which is a waterfall that you have to paddle to from a small village called Morena, about 20-30 kms north of Aquisimon.", " The review by &quot;Queen J&quot; earlier was spot on; please refer to her review for all the places to visit. Huasteca is a region on the eastern part of the San Luis Potosi province. We drove east from San Luis Potosi via RioVerde to the Huasteca Potosina region. Here, for between 400 (shared) and 600 pesos (alone); the guide will take you in his canoe (4km) paddling to the magnificent water falls. ON the way back, there is a stop at a large cavern which is a natural swimming hole.. \n\n- Another good place we visited was the Sotano De las Golondrinas; or the cave of the swallows; and is on the outskirts of Aquisimon town. This is a huge cave 330m deep, and the top of the cave is open and about 50m wide. Very early morning (6:30-8:30AM), the swallows come out of the cave by the hundreds to forage for food for the day, returning in the evening. So you have to get here by 6:30AM, and be patient and quiet (swallows will not come out of they sense noise and hence danger threat). When the swallows come out, the fly our counterclockwise out of the cave slowly and then take off by the hundreds. You get there by driving very early in the morning (about 20 mins from Aquisimon), pay the 30 peso entrance fees, and hike down 560 steps to the top of the cave. - Xilitla is a noce picturesque town built on steep hillsides; similar to swiss towns.", " The waterfalls are worth the view, and you can jump/swim off a large boulder &quot;island&quot; near the foot of the falls.", " Edward James Surreal Gardens (castle, waterfall, and pools), located 15 min outside of the town of Xilitla. Parrot Cave-  Near Xilitla (5 min drive), past the Pemex station, is a huge cave that is visited at sunset by green parakeets (not to be confused with The Huge Cave, El S\u00f3tano, near Aquism\u00f3n). By bus, Aquism\u00f3n is about 1 hr north of Xilitla and 2 hrs south of Ciudad Valles. From Aquism\u00f3n, buses are rare heading the 8km up to the cave opening. Entrance fee and hike down to the site are minimal. Go during high tourist season (Feb to May) to rappel or descend (via spiral staircase) into the cave and walk on the massive floor below. These rivers are all fresh, cold, bright aqua blue, and perfect for swimming in the hot, humid jungle. This one is located 30 minutes north of Xilitla in a tiny pueblo called Huichihuay\u00e1n. It's about an hour north of Xilitla, just past the town of Aquism\u00f3n. Just before the bridge (over the river), is a stone path that leads to the source, where the water cascades into a series of small pools. Missions - visit any of the first five missions established by Friar Jun\u00edpero Serra - who later founded the California missions - south of Rio Verde, along the road to Jalpan, and Quer\u00e9taro. Waterfalls- various waterfalls can be found near the towns of Rio Verde, Tamasopo, Ciudad Valles, and Xilitla. - The Tamasopo Falls is a 5 minute bus ride just outside the town. -The Puente de Dios cave and falls are a 10 min drive in the other direction outside of town. - The Temazcal Cascades are a 5 minute walk up the road from the parking lot of the Edward James Surreal Gardens. You can arrange a half day tour in Aquism\u00f3n, and often at the river itself. It takes about two hours to paddle upstream to the waterfall. Hot springs - Hotel Taninul, famous for its hot springs, is a popular resort located 25 miles east of Ciudad Valles. Archaeological Zones - Tamu\u00edn:\nTamtok and El Consuelo display remnants of the Huastecan culture between the years 600-900, and are located just after the turn off to the Hotel Taninul, on the right. Caverns and caves - there are a variety of caverns throughout the Huasteca south and west of Ciudad Valles, 2 hrs south of Rio Verde (the Arroyo Seco area), and around Xilitla. La Media Luna - this &quot;Half Moon Lagoon&quot; is a small lake about 30 minutes outside of Rio Verde (which is two hours east of San Luis Potos\u00ed). Though it is small, it is ideal for swimming and scuba diving, due to warm (86\u00b0), extraordinarily crystal-clear, azure water that becomes profoundly deep once you venture past its shallow fingers. Authentic Huastecan towns:\n- Apezco - This is a small mountain village to the west of Xilitla with amazing  views, reached via a 1-2 hr hike up a steep, dirt road. - Tancanhuitz de Santos (Ciudad Santos) is located South of Cd Valles about 40 min north of Xilitla. Look for a turnoff to the right about 20 minutes after you pass through Huichihuay\u00e1n. Typical Huastecan dress, handicrafts, and a church built on top of an ancient Huastecan pyramid can all be seen here. Market day in Santos is Sunday. - Huehuetl\u00e1n - This is one of the prettiest towns in the area, located on a hilltop above a long, wide flight of stairs. Many trees, bright flowers, and vines make this town picturesque. A few miles ahead, on a gravel road is Aguacatitla, a main hub of medicinal herbal &quot;potions&quot;. There are at least 8 major waterfalls throughout the region, 4 or 5 main rivers, and endless cliffs, caves, and caverns to explore. Otherwise, I'd recommend reservations a few months ahead even when it means paying more. The cheapest and most plentiful lodging can be found in Ciudad Valles, but honestly, it's a pit of a town and the most humid of the entire area. And not in a good way. I'd recommend Tamosopo as a launching pad near the north and southwest activities, and either Aquism\u00f3n - or the more expensive Xilitla - to be near the activities in the east. They are all very small, quaint towns, but you can still find adequate 2 and 3 star hotels with beautiful surroundings, adequate accommodations, restaurants (although I wouldn't eat in the hotel restaurants), hot water, and vending machines. Fly into the nearest major airport:\n- Fly into Mexico City and drive/bus to Xilitla or San Luis Potos\u00ed, roughly 7-8hrs. Fly into a smaller, closer, much more expensive airport:\n- the following airports are three times the cost and will NOT save time, as all routes to these airports are via another airport (usually Mexico City) and incur long layovers (6-12 hrs):\n- San Luis Potos\u00ed, Tampico, Quer\u00e9taro, Le\u00f3n/Bah\u00eda, or Aguascalientes. If you need more specific advice on bus transportation once you're within the region, read my July 2015 reviews on Hotel Cosmos near Tamasopo, Hotel d'Carmona in Ciudad Valles, Cascadas Tamasopo, Edward James Surreal Gardens (and las pozas), and Hotel Dolores in Xilitla. In short, do not let the traveler warnings deter you from visiting one of the most beautiful areas in Mexico (and there are SO many!) Just plan well and use  common sense.", " I'm still not sure to what exactly this attraction entry on TripAdvisor is supposed to refer...as the &quot;Huasteca Potosina&quot; is a large forest/jungle region throughout half the state of San Lu\u00eds Potos\u00ed...

For this reason, I'd recommend you plan on spending at least a week in this region, if possible. I always strongly recommend arranging everything yourself and using public transportation or a rented car to enjoy the luxury of arriving early to avoid the crowds (priceless), and the freedom of dictating your own schedule once there (equally valuable). As a single, blonde, female traveler, I had zero problems with safety in the region - not to imply that I don't need to be familiar with the area ahead of time (I study up), wary of my surroundings at all times, as inconspicuous as possible (for a white girl), or speak Spanish (my accent passes). I employ all of those skills when traveling, as should you. That said, I can often access areas that may prove tricky for travelers who do not speak any Spanish or are bogged down by pack mules loaded with touristy &quot;stuff&quot; or a pesky passel of kids.

Next day, we visited &quot;Sotano de las golondrinas&quot; (Cave of the Swallows), Rio Huichiuayan, and Pozas de Xilitla. For lunch or dinner, &quot;La Curva&quot; seafood restaurant was a great place to taste the &quot;acamayas&quot; (freshwater shrimp).

I hope to return in the future and stay and visit more of the waterfalls, caves and other attractions. All I can say is that it's beyond worth however it means to get there.

You can swim in the pool at the base of the falls, but we didn't bring our suits so we just waded. It's not terribly far, but I was surprised to see a large underground waterfall inside the back of the cave. Our guide took pictures of us, pointed out stalagtites and stalagmites, as well as fossils and bats. I skipped the cave the first time, so glad we didn't this time around! If you go with a guide they will limit your time, usually around an hour and a half but this is doable.

Take a tour that includes 2 or 3 and take your swimsuit!", " First things first as a heads up, you have to pay twice to get into Misol-ha.

At the end of the trail is a cave which costs 10 Pesos to enter and the guy will lend you his torch to see inside the cave.

Not only because it's famous from the Predator movie from 80's who was shoot in the area, but also it's a wonderful natural place with possibility to swim. The entrance is just about $25 pesos and its also possible to go behind the waterfall and take a photos from The back (take waterproof camera or a plastic bag at least).", " In my opinion this is far more impressive than the Agua Azul Waterfalls.

My recommendation, don't take a tour.", " The spray created was enough to douse you if you walked behind the falls (which I highly recommend doing). If you venture in far enough you will find a waterfall inside the mountain.", " This was a really pretty waterfall. You could walk on the path behind it as well as swim in the water in front of it. It was a bit cold, but worth the $30 or so pesos per person to get in.", " It's a big and powerful waterfall, but nothing really special about it... A nice stop between san cristobal and palenque if youq are doing the trip anyway", " Is a long fall waterfall, you doesn\u2019t expect to see that majestic waterfall, beautiful place to swim and to visit, very nice, take your camera and something to cover it because there\u2019s a lot of mist", " There was a cave on the other side under the waterfall but we didn't go in it.", " When we arrived at Palenque we booked a trip to Palenque archaeological site which took in the full morning, in the afternoon we visited Misol-High waterfall and then onto Agua Azul wateralls which took up the afternoon. After that we then went on to San Christobal for a couple of days. Misol-High is a high drop waterfall.

The sheer volume from multiple waterfalls hurtles down the mountains &amp; concentrates in a large pool of water at the base. Further down the power of the waters dissipates enough to allow bathers to wade out with the aid of a rope strung across the raging river. Because of the sloping topography of the location, visitors can climb the steps of the hill adjacent to the falls &amp; get a number of different vantage points of the wildly gushing waters. The over-touristy nature of the site detracts a bit from Agua Azul\u2019s natural wonder, the place is teeming with too many persistent vendors &amp; hawkers &amp; an over-concentration of souvenir &amp; food huts.", " We like the wonderful waterfalls of Azul and could enjoy the different steps of the falls.

The street was to 50% destroyed, some parts of the street &quot;filled out&quot; with stones, some parts washed out by the rain,  nothing for week hearts  but the landscape just stunning. I must say, probably my experience at agua azul is bias because of a group of people who stopped our van by standing in front of it and partially surrounding it, not allowing us to drive further unless we buy souvenirs and fruit from them. This experience in &quot;the mountains&quot; just left us already willing to turn around and forget about the waterfall. Anyways, we finally made it to Agua Azul. During the rainy season the water is brown and you cannot swim however you get to see the &quot;power&quot; of the waterfall when 2-3 times more water is coming down.

I did visit during the rainy season so the Cascadas de Agua Azul (Blue Falls) were anything but, plenty of brown water due to the rain. I would recommend to try the small bananas, they are delicious.

They are mineral springs that look like frozen waterfalls.", " It is a bit of a mission getting there if you do not want to do a tour and not much cheaper.Its about  an hour and a half/two hours each way with the collectivo taxi and the truck.Its a short uneven hike to the &quot;falls&quot; to then see two MAN Made pools the second of which people swim in (the water is cold despite the bubbling ) I live in New Zealand and this site was nothing in comparasion to the falls there.If you are near palenque save your Mexican waterfall for Agua Azul.", " We had the best time, go around and down to see the big &quot;waterfall&quot; you do not need a guide it is very easy, 15-20 m each way.", " When we arrived we first passed by the pools and kept going down the mountain till we reached some springs and waterfalls, only after coming up we had a swim in the nice water.", " This mineral &quot;waterfall&quot; is amazing to see.", " What is an great drive before you enter the villages there are some signposts \n to the waterfalls. You have to pay buy the gate for driving to the car park and pay entre fee fir going to the waterfalls. The petrified waterfalls are great to see.", " First of all, let me say that this place has not waterfalls, the things you see are made of salt. The pools don\u2019t go deeper than 4 feet.", " I joined local tour and Hierve el Agua was the last stop. Very beautiful nature scene, you can stand on the pool side to look back the waterfall under the sunset!", " This mineral &quot;waterfall&quot; is amazing to see.", " you can see waterfalls on the other side but it's not &quot;made of water&quot;, is pretified.", " Never seen anything like it. You can swim and it requires some hiking, but calcified waterfalls?", "The frozen waterfalls are, of course, not frozen at all but a compilation of minerals that have built up over the years to make what looks like waterfalls.", " Really pleasant day trip from Oaxaca, you can see the calcified waterfalls and take a swim. Facilities are excellent and there are lots of cheap places to eat.", " The adventure starts from getting there: don't take the tour (you won't have time to walk around), share a taxi (communato) to Mitla instead and a pick-up track to the waterfalls.", " The adventure starts from getting there: don't take the tour (you won't have time to walk around), share a taxi (communato) to Mitla instead and a pick-up track to the waterfalls. The waterfalls are petrified (the water is trickling though) and the place is very special and unique.", " The area Hierve del Agua contains petrified waterfalls where springs of mineral water have formed and run down the mountain. The first, which is closest to the entrance, has natural pools that you can swim in. Although hierve means &quot;the boiling&quot;, the water is not hot, it's actually referring to the appearance of certain spots where the water &quot;boils&quot; up from the ground. The second waterfall is a small hike down in which you can observe the natural beauty of the Oaxacan flora.", " The waterfalls are not actually water falls but stone! They are so beautiful. You can swim in them and they are soooo nice!", "Magnificent calcified waterfalls and beautiful scenery!", " Hierve el Agua is a bit of an experience. The trip involves getting a taxi/colectivo to Mitla, and then another to here. Hierve el Agua itself is a set of 2 petrified waterfalls. The closer one has small pools of water than you can swim or dip your feet in. The further one provides some beautiful views of the 1st waterfall, as well as the surrounding valley area. Lots of walking/hiking can be done around here, so be sure to bring lots of sunscreen and a hat/sunglasses as it can get very sunny/hot up here, despite the altitude.", " Then of course there is the petrified waterfall, whilst it is great to see it from the car park area, it is worthwhile walking to the top of the waterfall, this is only about 10-15 minutes and again well worth it.", "One of the only two petrified waterfalls in the world, a little far from Oaxaca, but totally worth it.", " The first waterfall is a 5 min walk. But please go to the other waterfall. It's a 20 min walk hard walk. It's not quite organised. If you can take your suiwsuit it's a good idea.", " I guess after the waterfalls of Palenque it was kind of anticlimactic.", " Walk around the place if you feel a little adventurous, and don't feel like just staying at the top looking the view (although I understand if that's what you like, because it's quite pretty and relaxing) But you can walk the path and get to the top of the actual waterfall, take a picture there, and then take anoter path that will take you down. It's not a long way from the city, but it will take you some time, plus the time you spend there, I would say you need a day to visit and enjoy. You can also swim there and last time I was there they were building a hotel but I'm not sure it's working yet.", " Yes, the petrified waterfall is what you go there for, but the scenery is gorgeous. Walk around the place if you feel a little adventurous, and don't feel like just staying at the top looking the view (although I understand if that's what you like, because it's quite pretty and relaxing) But you can walk the path and get to the top of the actual waterfall, take a picture there, and then take anoter path that will take you down. And then keep walking and walking and walking (please take water with you) and you will end on the oposite end from the important waterfall.", " For those brave enough you can take the small hike to the waterfalls and then come back around to the natural spring where they allow you to swim."]}
