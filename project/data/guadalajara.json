Now just a few things: first of all if you are coming from out of the country make sure to have all your paper work in order because if you don\\'t then you may lose the date. Second make sure you get there early for your number to reserve you date for the following month. You have to make two trips. One for the date to see if your date will be open, and another to see if the time will also be open. I know it makes no sense but that\\'s the way they do it. For the price everything is included but you can\\'t pick anything out for your special day. The flowers, music, runner, is all included. You do need to bring your own bible though and they don\\'t do unity candles. You should also bring your own rosary and coins so they can be blessed. Aside from that you will have a every pleasant time if you follow all the rules.

For those with enough time, this was deemed by TA and others a must see.\\n\\n     As we were afoot, we were obligated to take a bus.  Alejandra, at the desk of the Hotel,  suggested that we take the 214 running west.  After one false start, we found the correct place to wait and were soon aboard a bus, after verifying our destination with the driver.  He even made change for us.\\n\\n     We settled in towards the back and enjoyed the ride as the bus zig zagged through the crowded streets.  The lady sitting next to us spoke about as much English as I did Spanish and indicated that we were on the right bus and that she would give us the high sign when it was time to disembark.  \\n\\n     And then the most amazing thing happened.  The bus driver fired up his boom box and played and Old Timey Mexican tune.  As the lyrics came around on the guitar, about half the people on the bus started singing along.  These people were truly happy to be there on the bus singing together.   Just try to imagine getting on a bus in Chicago and your fellow passengers start singing along with Home On the Range.  I personally can not conjure that image.  \\n\\n    Do you ever wonder when you read those reviews about which country has the happiest people.  I mean, how could someone in Mexico be happier than someone lucky enough to live in San Francisco?    For me, this was (as my lovely wife puts it) an Ah Ha! moment.  Even I was happy to be riding on that  old bus.   \\n\\n    Too soon, it was time to disembark.  I looked at the street signs, found our location on the map, walked around the corner and, miracles never cease, there was the church.  the Templo Expiatorio was nicely illuminated in the morning sun, standing tall and clean, just like the pictures.  There is an open square in front of the church, so you can take your own picture.  \\n\\n    Up close, we enjoyed a statue of John Paul II blessing a local bishop and then we walked inside.  This is a beautiful new church with a tall Gothic vault.  Although (supposedly) work was begun in the late 19th century, the final touches were completed in 1975.  I could have easily imagined being in a modern Episcopal church in Los Angeles.  The doors were nice, the bronze curlicues hanging above the pews were nice, but at the end of the day this was just a modern house of worship.  \\n\\n     And so we moved on. \\n\\n     It being Monday, the Art Museum at the University of Guadalajara right across the street from the temple was closed.\\n\\n     A block further west we stopped for tacos at a small restaurant.  The owner was super nice, his tacos were delicious and we had a view of the temple in one direction and a really nice surrealistic mural to amuse us in the other direction.  A good traveler finds his high points as he goes along, and we had experienced two.\\n\\n   We finished our morning by walking on to Chapultepec, named for that hill where the Ni\\u00f1os H\\u00e9roes took on Winfield Scott.   Chapultepec in GDL is a shopping district where Alejandra had promised art galleries galore.  Well, it was Monday and we had no better luck than the Ni\\u00f1os H\\u00e9roes;  Anything associated with art in Chapultepec was closed.  Unlike the cadets on that hill, we were permitted to retire, bloodied but unbowed, to a taxi which, for 70 P (5 USD), took us back to the Hotel Morales.\\n\\n    Alejandra went one for two and we had two outstanding Mexican experiences.  Which I think is why we went to Mexico in the first place.

My wife and I walked there from Plaza de la Libertad, it took us about a half hour because we stopped to browse in shops along the way, which I highly recommend. One suggestion if you do this: walk west on Avenida Juarez instead of Avenida Lopez Cotilla.  The Expiatorio is located on Cotilla, and Avenida Juarez is a block north of that. But Juarez has much more retail activity (even on a Sunday) so there is more to look at. It also means more foot traffic, which makes it a bit safer, too. We walked along Cotilla for two blocks and it was a bit shabby and run down, there was no one around, windows were boarded up, etc. It just had that chill of feeling a shade unsafe. So we cut back up a block to Juarez and everything was fun again. Also on Juarez you will go through Revolution Park, which is something of a counter-cultural magnet \\u2013 kids with piercings and dyed hair, skate punks, Rastafarians, etc. It was kind of cool to see a little of that in G\\u2019hara. \\n\\nAnyway, back to the main attraction: the Expiatorio is a stunning gothic cathedral, built on a grand scale. Walk up the center aisle and when you reach the altar, look up into the vault - it feels like something out of a movie. It goes up for a dozen stories and is lit with stained glass, tapering off into a vanishing point. It is really worth seeing. Then do something most visitors miss: walk around the back of the altar (yes, its allowed when mass is not in service) and view the altar from behind. The challis is bathed in a spooky blue light and if you look down you will see one of the crypts. During the hour I was there, I did not see a single other tourist do this. \\n\\nThe rest of the cathedral is equally impressive in terms of its decorative arts, there is a side building with the main crypt; and the plaza out front is full of vendors and food, especially on Sundays after mass. There is a taxi rank off to the right if you don\\u2019t feel like walking all the way back to centro historico when you are done. \\n\\nOne other suggestion: I usually like to visit sites first thing in the morning to beat the crowds. But I would go here in the afternoon when so the sun is facing the front of the church, which has some gold leaf frescoes that catch the light.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Expiatory Temple", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/d4/5c/95/expiatory-temple.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Francisco Indelecio Madero 935", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "44100", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "188964598": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Most to see!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d558549-Reviews-Expiatory_Temple-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/d4/5c/95/expiatory-temple.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Beautiful building!!

Also, my wife typically is not a big fan of zoos because the animals are cramped in; however, these animals had plenty of space. This is a great experience for all ages; however, if you are in Guadalajara, this is a MUST! The zoo has lions, tigers, elephants, several different bears, all number of tropical birds, farm animals, penguins and even a full aquarium complete with sharks. We purchased the Premier Package, which included everything except for the Sky Zoo, which is a chairlift (my son was too young to ride on it). We took the train around the zoo initially, which gave us a well-rounded look at what the zoo has to offer. We then walked through the entire main park. Sadly, because we were there during the crowded week of Semana Santa, by the time we walked around the whole zoo and got to the location where you can take the safari, the line was far too long and my son was falling asleep. We did do a quick run through of the penguin area, but my son was so wiped out, he did not get to see that. We will certainly return to take the safari and check out the aquarium.

MAKE SURE YOU WEAR SUNBLOCK, A HAT, AND SHADES. It was a really really hot day. We got the zoo+penguin package for 2 adults and 1 child, spent ~$300 mxn.... the penguin habitat was rather disappointing, just one display in a too-warm-for-penguins room with a handrail to stop at to take pictures and then a treadmill to get you right outta there into the overpriced souvenirs shop as quickly as possible...the staff constantly encouraged people to get moving and to get on the treadmill already as it was getting crowded... the room gets full quickly enough...overall I don\\'t think it\\'s worth the extra pay, I think the Sky Zoo ride is a lot more value for your coin (that we ended up skipping as we ran out of cash). Oh yeah btw, they ONLY take cash. Everywhere. Cash ONLY. So, be ready. There\\'s this one Banorte ATM right next to the ticket booths (just so you don\\'t assume: tickets are cash only) but once you get in, it\\'s you and whatever change you got in your pocket, no other ATMs inside. The zoo is somewhat large, however, the habitats seemed rather small. You will only be able to see the zebras, rhinos, and ostriches by getting on the safari ride, no way to access on foot (if you don\\'t get the safari pack upon access, you can pay extra once inside). Elephants are somewhat far from the on-foot trail, and giraffes are on the last habitat on the farthest point of the zoo, we just didn\\'t bother to make it there. Food is somewhat expensive, 1L water= $21, (hot) sandwiches= $30, hot dogs= $34, popsicles range from $17-$30/$40 (and good luck finding one that is not creamy), and \\'\\'slushies\\'\\' (flavored crushed ice)= $27. There are several small \\'\\'food courts\\'\\' with some snacks like chips, nachos, popcorn, burgers, tortas, etc ranging from $30-$100. Bathrooms were fairly clean. Lots of souvenir kiosks, frankly overpriced low-quality stuff; fairly good quality stuff prices are just ludacris ($250+ for a decent TINY stuffed animal). I mean, high prices are expected...just bring your piggy bank, specially when with young children or large families. Overall, it\\'s a good place to visit on a day out, being exposed to nature is always a good treat. The facilities were fairly clean, and the animals looked healthy. Bring plenty of water and comfy shoes, it\\'ll be a long long walk. Some of the trails are not too stroller/wheelchair friendly, but it\\'s fair to say that you could get through most of the zoo without problems (you can rent wheelchairs and kiddie carts inside).

In addition there are cubs you can feed and interact with (basic ticket is $10, $40 if you want a bag of food for the animals you can feed, and all inclusive is $90-$100 which lets you feed the cubs).  I did the basic, something about the handling of the cubs just doesn\\'t quite sit right with me, but maybe it does with you, not judging, I just didnt do it.\\n\\nThat said, the collection of animals they have is pretty impressive.  Off the top of my head, a collection of different monkeys, flamingos, ducks &amp; swans (that walk freely through the park), jaguar, mountain lion, hippos, mountain goats, the tigers obviously, lions, deer, and a collection of smaller animals.\\n\\nHalfway through when you hit the snack stand there\\'s patio where you can look down in the tiger &amp; lion pens, make sure you stop to see.\\n\\nA word of warning - humidity is high, its in the hills a bit, the area never really dries out.  The path is round stones embedded in concrete and when it slopes it can be slick, I bit it at a spot almost at the end.  Be careful.\\n\\nMy thoughts on the zoo - I\\'m from Chicago and the Lincoln Park zoo is pretty amazing, I have also seen St Louis and San Diego\\'s, all are outstanding and seem to give the animals plenty of room.  This one...the animals seem to be very well cared for but the pens are small (the big cats especially - altho the white &amp; golden had a huge side area), the animals you can feed are waiting for you to feed them and they are looking for it which bothered me, and when you walk in, the first pen you see is a monkey (I dont remember the type, might have been an ape instead) but it was just sitting on the edge, hand at the fence, hoping for food like someone begging for change.

We purchased only the entry and safari but there are a variety of packages at a reasonable cost. The safari area is small but the opportunity to feed the giraffes made it worth it. The area of the monkeys is really cool, they have mesh tunnels that run all over and connect to the bigger monkey habitat, the tiny squirrel (I think) monkeys were all over the place and it was a neat opportunity to see them closer. The bird and reptile shows were pretty good, the reptile show is very funny, but you need to have a good grasp of Spanish to enjoy the jokes so I would skip if you are not familiar with the language. The herpetarium was very nice, and had a/c! And the black bear habitat was truly beautiful, plus with three bears in there you got quite a treat watching them play and walk around. \\n\\nCons: The water in the safari area was very green but I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s treated or just gets dirty because of all the animals. The bathroom facilities were small and sparse so there was always a long line at the women\\u2019s.\\n\\nFor little kids: Good food options, and glitter tattoos and face painting available!

The train \\'road\\' is separate from the walking path so you never have to worry about any motorized vehicles.\\n\\nThe monkey section was fun with them scampering about at your feet, and at the railings.  Just be aware if you\\'re carrying camera gear or other water sensitive items, the attendants are quite liberal with water spray bottles to keep the monkeys off of people and backpacks.  \\n\\nFood options are limited to concession stands at the train and skyway platforms, - the bottom and near the top. The lines were very long and didn\\'t move during the 10 minutes we stood in them and finally gave up.  We opted for more wanderings among the animals instead.\\n\\nWe visited on a Saturday, our only option.  We were surprised at the number of large groups, most likely schools.

The zoo is a bit out of the center, but you can get there easily using the MacroBus, which can be faster than taxi since it uses its own lane.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zoologico Guadalajara", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/25/f9/55/a-tiger-cub-in-the-pool.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo del Zoologico 600 Huentitan el Alto", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "44390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "376920068": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "First class zoo", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d184503-Reviews-Zoologico_Guadalajara-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/25/f9/55/a-tiger-cub-in-the-pool.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Well planned and maintained.

The aquarium, with the shark tanks, was a big hit too, as were the penguins.

The guides, dressed in African garb, give you a handful of carrots to feed to the giraffes when the bus slows. We were on the bus with a group of school kids who screamed and laughed with delight while the guide watched with a big smile on his face. I recommend getting the ticket which gives you full access to all the features of the park-it is worth it! There is a senior discount. Seniors pay what ninos, children, pay instead of the adult entry fee. You can work out how to take a local bus to the park or you can take a taxi.\\nThere is food available in the zoo, pizzas, hot dogs.This provided a nice break from museums, shopping, etc.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zoologico Guadalajara", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/25/f9/55/a-tiger-cub-in-the-pool.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo del Zoologico 600 Huentitan el Alto", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "44390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "321763654": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Zoologico Guadalajara is a top place to visit", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d184503-Reviews-Zoologico_Guadalajara-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/25/f9/55/a-tiger-cub-in-the-pool.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Zoologico Guadalajara has definitely been a highlight during our stay in Mexico.

As a family we\\'ve been to a few.. (Milwaukee, San Diego, Monterey Bay). This is by far the BEST one we\\'ve ever been to! \\n\\nThe zoo is open from 10a-6p. You pay a mere $4.50 US for adults and $2 US for kids for general admission. A bargain compared to US zoos. (Pay in Pesos, they don\\'t take Dollars). We got the Diamond package $14 US adults and $10 US kids for all the bells and whistles, Sky Zoo, Safari tour, Aquarium,  and Train ride. The safari ride was a great way to tour the whole zoo, especially if you have little ones (save some walking) and the aerial view from the Sky Zoo is fantastic!\\n\\nMake sure to stop by Australia Village, Monkeyland, and Amazon Territory. \\n\\nWe spent the whole day and brought a picnic lunch, but they have restaurant\\'s, gift shops, and side spots for drinks too. I noticed they had wheelchair and stroller rentals which were in good shape. Bring your sunscreen, hat or umbrella for shade. It was hot and very sunny. We met a few English bilingual speaking employees but I speak Spanish so it was good for me either way. The kids aren\\'t so fluent so English speakers were helpful.\\n\\nOverall, this is a MUST SEE!! By far the BEST experience and BEST zoo I\\'ve ever been to. The animal\\'s have lot\\'s of space to roam and are in excellent condition. \\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zoologico Guadalajara", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/25/f9/55/a-tiger-cub-in-the-pool.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo del Zoologico 600 Huentitan el Alto", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "44390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "279805848": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A GREAT PLACE TO SEE THE ANIMALS", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d184503-Reviews-Zoologico_Guadalajara-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/25/f9/55/a-tiger-cub-in-the-pool.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I went to the zoo twice.

Only one is south of the US border with Mexico.  Our experience at the Guadalajara zoo was very pleasant, but this may not have been because the collection itself was excellent.  \\n\\n    There is a moderately large amount of animals, all well cared for.  Really close access, something you don\\'t get in most North American zoos, was limited to the ring tailed lemurs, squirrel monkeys and the giraffes on the safari ride.  Compared to the world class Singapore Zoo, this isn\\'t so much.  A few animals, like the American Flamingos and the King Vultures were remarkable.  \\n\\n     People in Guadalajara, and the guide books, emphasize that this is a very large zoo.  This is not really true, either.  We were both sick with a cold, but we walked the whole zoo in four hours, including the aquarium and the Masai Mara ride.  \\n     \\n     Depending on your point of view, the safari ride (one of the signature attractions) was a bit of a disappointment.  The guide was a typical middle class Mexican wearing a red shawl.  It made me wonder if there was not a single Mexican/African available to perform this role.  The road upon which the safari is run was very rough.  This too is not realistic, as wildlife tourism is a big deal in Kenya the roads there are pretty well graded.  The sloping field where the animals were displayed was not especially well tended.  And the Masai cattle mixed in with all the other animals.  Oh well.\\n     \\n    So why do i rate this zoo so highly?  We visited on a Wednesday morning, the day the zoo opens for the week.   As with a couple other attractions, there were scads of school children at the zoo.  Call me a softy, but I really like middle class Mexican kids.  (I apologize for being so class conscious, but in this part of the world it is silly to ignore the reality...poor kids probably don\\'t get fancy uniforms, multiple teachers or a trip to the zoo.)  Compared to their peers back in the EUA, they are enthusiastic and out going...not jaded in search of the next video game.   They responded eagerly to the fake Masai warrior and they interacted gregariously with us.  One boy offered Sandra one of his cookies, for crying out loud.     \\n\\n    Call me a hopeless optimist, but I think these kids are the future of our two nations.  We need to do all we can to embrace them.\\n \\n   Global politics aside, being at the zoo with the kids howling with the gibbons, oohing at the lions, etc, was a real treat for us.\\n\\n    Two quick tips.   Most of the Mexicans brought their own food.  We should have tried harder to do this.  Second, it is perfectly possible to take the Macrobus to the zoo.  it runs in its own lane up Caliz. Indepedencia and has a stop across the street form an auxiliary zoo entrance.  At this time, it cost 7 pesos each, no special card required.  We took a taxi to the zoo from our hotel for only 100 Pesos (about 7 USD)\\n\\n    We had a great time at the Guadalajara Zoo and I bet you will, too.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zoologico Guadalajara", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/25/f9/55/a-tiger-cub-in-the-pool.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo del Zoologico 600 Huentitan el Alto", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "44390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "270241944": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Exciting attractions and beautiful landscape", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d184503-Reviews-Zoologico_Guadalajara-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/25/f9/55/a-tiger-cub-in-the-pool.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "You can go on a safari, be a veterinarian at the pet zoo, watch some shows, touch the mantas and even dive in a cage at the sharks tank!!!!!

There is the Sky Zoo chairlift which carries one over the top of numerous exhibits to the lower limits of the zoo and back up.  This provides one with a grasp of just what the drop is and how much one wants to tackle.\\n2) There is a rubber tired &quot;train&quot; which will transport you along a paved path down and back up the hill.\\n3) In the Safari Masi Masa (Africa section), there is a transport vehicle which takes you out amongst the African animals in a natural setting.  This is a very rough ride and the metal bench seats are not particularly kind to ones back.  Sitting up towards the front may provide one with the best ride?\\n\\nThe Zoo offers numerous types of passes and depending on how much time you have to spend - you can choose the pass that fits your needs.  The Paquete Diamante is the full park pass and is priced at $195MXN for adultos and $135MXN for ninos.\\n\\nThis is a great facility and well worth allocating a full day for a visit!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zoologico Guadalajara", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/25/f9/55/a-tiger-cub-in-the-pool.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo del Zoologico 600 Huentitan el Alto", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "44390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "194914235": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "excellent zoo...get the all inclusive package", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d184503-Reviews-Zoologico_Guadalajara-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/25/f9/55/a-tiger-cub-in-the-pool.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Outstanding zoo....w the big pkg you get it all.

We had a great time except for the fact that wheelchairs were not listed on the website, and we could not speak fluent Spanish when we called the number provided.  We arrived to find out if they had wheelchairs since my daughter just had knee surgery in Guadalajara since she lives down there.  We had to go down 80 steps at the entrance after paying to get our wheelchair.  The wheelchairs and strollers should be at the entrance where you pay.  I was not happy and it was difficult for my daughter. The Skylift  and train were a nice way to see the zoo and save yourself some walking.  They had a polar bear, white tiger cubs, great aquarium and reptile building.  They did not have a Comodo Dragon like the website advertised, I even asked where it was.  They had a Monitor Lizard instead. It was a lot of walking for me since I have had a knee replacement and have one knee getting worse.  Wish they had electric mobilities.  You should get the total package combo that includes the train and Skyride.  We did not get to do the Safari ride due to time constraints and it began to rain.  Bring an umbrella if you go now since it is the rainy season during the summer.  It \\nis a big zoo! The cost wasn\\'t too bad.

This is a fairly new facility, having moved from the cramped former location downtown. The admission is about $7US for unlimited rides on the &quot;train&quot;, which gets you around the zoo, as well as a ride on the safari and your admission to the rest of the zoo. Be advised that credit cards can be used at the gate, but nowhere else! Even though we saw credit card terminals in some of the stores, we were always being told by the completely useless staff that they &quot;didn\\'t work&quot; (and believe me - it wasn\\'t just a tourist thing- my wife is a native Spanish-speaker). Upon entering, the park looks fairly nice, and the park is clean. The path used by the &quot;train&quot; (actually just a train-looking vehicle pulling passenger trailers) is in need of repaving - it can be a rough ride especially when one tries to take photos. The safari ride is a highlight - the guide passes out food to give to the giraffes inside, who happily eat out of your hand! Again, I understand it is a safari ride, but a rough one at that! Can someone go in and work on the dirt road every couple of weeks? I almost bounced right out of the truck! Food is available here at reasonable prices, and if nothing else, have some ice cream here- the milk used seems to be less processed than at home and seems creamier. Just about every animal we went to look at was sleeping under cover of shade somewhere, so I think we would have been better off looking at a picture book of animals and saving the money we spent there. The biggest let down for us was going to see the kangaroos- you can walk around among them, but like almost every other animal in the place, they were all laid out sleeping!

Upon boarding the train, we were seated in a first class train car with luxury place settings and glasses of tequila. It started at 9am and appetizers/snacks started arriving. First tip, do not eat breakfast prior to boarding the train. Besides a pastry you can get before you board, there is plenty of food on the ride to Tequila, the city. Being a non-Spanish speaker, it was nice that announcements of information on the train were in Spanish first and then English. Unfortunately the Spanish speakers would start talking after their announcement making the English announcements difficult to hear. It was time to taste the 3 glasses of tequila and a Sommelier did a tasting lesson of tequila (only done in Spanish). Fortunately I was with Spanish speaking family who could help translate. The tasting lessons were fantastic because we learned how to taste tequila without the burn down the throat. That made the rest of the trip much more enjoyable. And speaking of the rest of the train ride, besides more food, any kind of drink or cocktail was available whenever you wanted it, along with the service being excellent.\\n\\nWhen we arrived in Tequila, a band greeted everyone and we started toward the bus we were supposed to be in. Since we had indicated earlier that we would like an English tour, we instead were directed to a bus that had an English guide. It was nice that Jose Cuervo offers that option. The tour of the distillery and the rest of the day was spent with our wonderful tour guide. Tastings at the distillery were excellent.\\n\\nGiven 1-2 hours free, we headed to see the rest of the town. We all then met back at Jose Cuervo for an enjoyable show featuring music and dancing. Then it was time to board the buses and we went to one of their agave fields for an agave harvesting demonstration, which we enjoyed with more tequila. After the demonstration and more music, it was back on the bus for the return trip to Guadalajara including a bag lunch provided.\\n\\nWe did arrive in the dark and unfortunately it had really started raining badly when we arrived. There was confusion on what to do next because everybody was trying to get taxis or Uber rides. Tip: just stay at the train station and wait for your ride there instead of venturing out to get a ride.\\n\\nOverall, it was a very long day, but an excellent one being treated first class.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Jose Cuervo Express", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/40/82/01/tren-jose-cuervo-express.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Washington 10", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "45609", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "594502981": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "JOSE CUERVO EXPRESS a dream or a nightmare?", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d3338585-Reviews-Jose_Cuervo_Express-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/40/82/01/tren-jose-cuervo-express.jpg", "datePublished": "July 9, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I took my fiend from Sweden to this tour thinking that it would be friendly and worth it. Far from that, what we found to open the adventure is the station of the train near to the bad area in Guadalajara and lacking clear signs for orientation about &quot;where to go&quot;. We came back from Tequila tour late at night, it was dark and the personnel were rude, discourteous and useless. I was scared about my friend and I did not know where to go to take a bus. During the trip, they allow people to drink too much and they loose control over drunksters disturbing others who want to take it easy and enjoy in a sober way. I would not recommend it, I think you could do better by getting the bus from the terminal at Vallarta Avenue and do more fun w/o paying too much for been treated like crap. The cherry on the cake: besides the fact that you pay almost 2000 pesos per person, at the end of the trip, the crew asked directly for tips, shameless. I wonder if after getting so much income the company has not the decency as to pay properly to its personnel, byt doing thr math only that day they made almost half a million pesos (with the total of passengers vs amount paid for each ticket). It is a little world of abuse that I would not recommend to anyone, especially if you are a foreigner: avoid it and pay less but doing it yourself! with the money you save you can buy some bottles and drink at home without being the center of pityness to other folk.

We arrived at the train station, where they were waiting with snacks, fruit and drinks for us. Everything was well organized and we were taken to our wagons in orderly fashion.

Go with the premium plus it\\u2019s pricey we paid $4,800 mx pesos for 2 people and it was worth every dime of it. There is two different trains you can take morning and afternoon. We took the afternoon train meaning you will take a bus to Tequila and come back in the train. First, we went to the bus station where the staff welcomes you with coffee, Mexican bread, fruit, or chips we saw a small Azteca Dance. Then in a very organized way we were sent to the busses depending on what you purchased again if you buy the premium plus your bus will be more fancy, trust me you can tell. Once you board the bus on each sit you will have a snack bag contains: sandwich, strawberry yogurt, mango juice and a apple. As soon the bus departs de bus station the drinking starts you can drink as much as you want different kinds of drinks with tequila or even shots. If you are not a morning drinker still ask for something because they give you a cute souvenir cut from Jose Cuervo. The bus will make a stop to teach you how the actual process of the Tequila starts and then continues to the actual place where you will learn in how the Tequila is completed. Again more drinking. The drinks never stop. Once you reach the destination the guide person will take you in a tour and tells you the entire process completely. After all that you are let loose to do shopping and have lunch. The guides will give you a time to return back to the start point where you will see beautiful dances with mariachi. After this they will transfer you in buses to the train center. And this is when the fun starts more drinking here they have a more open bar anything you want and you will do more tequila tasting as well as appetizers.

My husband and I are English speakers from Chicago. We visited in May 2018. The check in process was smooth and vibrant. The train ride was fun, well-serviced, and we knew exactly where we were to be. The drinks were in abundance, as was the food. We purchased Premium Plus tickets. Once there, English speakers were grouped together for the rest of the tour, which was quite extensive. We had the best guide, Lupita, who was so knowledge and helpful. Once time for lunch, Lupita had made a reservation for us - requested once in Tequila - and the shuttle took us to the restaurant, Los Alohangos, I believe. Once finished with lunch, the shuttle was there to take us back to Tequila square. We shopped then met back with the group before a great mariachi show and more drinks. We did the sunrise train so we took the bus back and stopped by an agave field with a great demonstration by a jimador and more drinks and music. We even danced. So fun! The bus ride back was nice and we had a snack and played loteria. Once back at the bus station, Lupita advised us to take Uber or taxi. The taxi was almost 4x the price of an Uber - so we did that. Once away from the group and waiting on the Uber, the driver called as he could not find us. Up walks Lupita, takes the phone, and directs the driver to us. Platinum customer service even after the tour ends. We were so grateful. Lupita and Fabian (the bartender on the bus) really made the day seamless. Oh and tequila. Do it! Just remember - get to the station one hour early, follow institutions, have pesos, take  Uber back to your hotel, and buy premium tickets from the Cuervo site (200 bucks cheaper than using a middle man such as Expedia or Viator).

Every caboose has its own bartender and a tour guide that will make you feel good all the way! Once in Tequila you get to visit the distillery and see all the process...and more and more tequilas and margaritas! They also have a great show at the end with dancers and mariachis. In Tequila you get your own time to walk the beautiful town streets, enjoy local food, and listen to mariachis everywhere! No wonder this town is considered a magical town!

Heads up, no need to have any breakfast if you booked with any of the 3 packs they offer. We booked the premium pack, and it was worth every penny. Arive early to the train station to enjoy the pre hispanic dance show. There you will be served at no charge sweet bread and coffee. Also they start with the games to give away Tequila bottles for the people waiting to aboard.  The advantages of the premium pack is, we got an additional breakfast platter while sitting on a confortable bench with a nice table and a 3 shot tequila starter waiting for you. Waiters on the train excelent. A the train starts to move, a tour guide starts explaining various aspects of tequila that I personally never heard of. Once the train starts moving, the margaritas and pure tequilas or mixed drinks start raining, all included. Don\\'t get waisted in a 1 1/2 hour time frame or they will stop serving you. The JC tour is excelent. Once your tour is done, feel free to shop arround the area, you get about 3 hours of free time, use it wisley, it is not a waste of time.  Try to buy your tequila at the JC store as it is cheaper. Don\\'t need to buy until you are ready to head back home at 4 pm.  At tequila, dont hesitate to eat at the La Antigua Casona, looks fancy, but food is great and not over priced. Before you start heading back home, you will enjoy marichi music.  Start your bus ride hidrating yourself with tequila and cold mixed drinks fixed in the bus. A last stop is made at a Agave field where you learn the roots of the tequila making, and end it up with more tequila and marichi. You last hour on the bus will be fun as you may keep drinking and games are played to give away another tequila bottle. You day ends up at 8 pm. Great team efforts are shown to make customers happy during the whole day by the JC Express crew.

Absolutely a must do when you visit Guadalajara and probably one of the best ways to experience the town of Tequila", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Jose Cuervo Express", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/40/82/01/tren-jose-cuervo-express.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Washington 10", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "45609", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "419254212": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "best experience ever", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d3338585-Reviews-Jose_Cuervo_Express-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/40/82/01/tren-jose-cuervo-express.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "worth it every cent! we enjoyed the Mexico independence day at maximum. the tequila delicious and one of the best parties ever", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Jose Cuervo Express", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/40/82/01/tren-jose-cuervo-express.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Washington 10", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "45609", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "418290601": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "It was long but fun", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d3338585-Reviews-Jose_Cuervo_Express-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/40/82/01/tren-jose-cuervo-express.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A group of us tried this.

Even them were amazed by the experience. \\nThere are different options to visit the town of Tequila, Jalisco. We took the 9:00am train and decided to spend the night at the amazing hotel Solar de las Animas. I truly recommend it but you can also visit Tequila, spend an amazing day visiting the tequila factory (make sure it is the one from Cuervo as there are other options which are not even near in quality, service and amenities). You could take a bus, included in the package, to drive back to Guadalajara or you could take the train back - although it might be more expensive. There is another option which is traveling by bus in the morning and taking the evening train back to Guadalajara. Either way be prepared for trying different types of wonderful tequila, listen to Mexican music and having a blast. The scenery is great too. You will be able to photograph the agave fields and part of the manufacturing process. This is one of the best weekends I\\'ve ever had. If you can combine it with a night at the hotel it will be even better. Alternatively, book a table for lunch at the restaurant of the hotel and take a walk around the facilities. You will plan a second trip including a stay in the hotel. I can guarantee that.

They especially want their foreign travelers feel comfortable so they will answer any questions you may have! A sack lunch is provided for you one you board the train and the margaritas keep coming! Honestly, they are not very strong at all so you can easily have several without worry. The train ride itself takes about an hour and once you arrive in Tequila, the group is split up into different tours. All the English speakers are separated from the rest, about two groups in the entire train so your group is small. You will walk through the factory and have a special tasting. Once that is over, you will have a chance to do some shopping and eat dinner. You definitely want to eat dinner! There is a presentation at the end of the day which is super fun, with dancing, an agave harvesting demonstration, and more margaritas of course! ***Side note: Many children and teens do go on this tour as it is family friendly.

It only runs on Saturday and will use your entire day but honestly, you will have a good time!\\n\\nThe fare seems a little pricey (about $100US per person) but when you consider what is included, it was a fair deal.  You get the two-hour train ride to Tequila and back, with a box lunch provided, and when in Tequila you get a guided tour of the Jose Cuervo distillery along with a complete explanation of the history, art, and science of making tequila.  As a 250+ year old company, the Jose Cuervo company and family certainly know their stuff.\\n\\nOh, and did I mention that as soon as you board the train they serve you a margarita and they keep pouring them all day long?\\n\\nThe train is lovely -- well-done redecorated interior -- the staff is warm and friendly, and the ride was a lot of fun.  Our coach tour guide spoke very fluent English and she went out of her way to make sure we were following the important things being said in Spanish.  The bartenders mostly spoke Spanish only but were most helpful and friendly and did their best to make sure our glasses were never empty.\\n\\nThe countryside view varied between rustic and charming on one hand and run-down and destitute on the other ... but you do get a feeling you\\'re seeing authentic Mexican countryside.  Of course, the last part of the journey nearing Tequila you pass through extensive fields of agave, the plant from which the liquor is made.  Our trip was on a rainy and overcast day, but except for the few hours self-guided shopping time in Tequila, the weather was of no consequence.  \\n\\nTequila, as a town, has found out about tourism and is overflowing with kitsch tourist shops and street side vendors.  That\\'s okay -- get a souvenir to take home.  Also, there are ample restaurants in town and the Jose Cuervo Express builds in plenty of time for you to stop and get lunch.  Authentic Mexican food by definition!\\n\\nThe distillery tour was nice, professionally done, and our group toured in English.  (If not asked, make sure the train to express your preference for the language of the guided tour in the distillery.)  Our guide was knowledgeable and friendly, and at the end of the factory tour we were given a lesson in tequila tasting and appreciation -- no doubt to help us choose the premier brands!  Of course they also have a gift shop where you can buy anything in the way of souvenirs with Jose Cuervo insignia.\\n\\nThe distillery tour wrapped up with a short live demonstration as to how to harvest an agave plant, and a high-stepping Mariachi band and dance team.\\n\\n(In case you have a choice -- which we did -- leave your car behind and take a taxi to the train station.  There is no readily available parking and trust me you don\\'t want to think about driving when you return.)\\n\\nTo their credit, the train both ways and the distillery tours all ran exactly on time.\\n\\nI\\'ll say it again ... you don\\'t want to miss this and you will need to plan your stay in Guadalajara to include it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Jose Cuervo Express", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/40/82/01/tren-jose-cuervo-express.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Washington 10", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "45609", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "329619994": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Scam", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d3338585-Reviews-Jose_Cuervo_Express-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/40/82/01/tren-jose-cuervo-express.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The train was just as shown on their webpage...

Be sure and shell out the bucks for the premium package. You want to be in the dining car and have the Tequila tasting walkthrough along the way. So it happens like this... you get in your seat and are presented with three small glasses of Tequila and and a fresh fruit plate with Yogurt and Granola. Everyone waits for the hostess to direct the tequila tasting (except for the jokester Mexican tourists that down all their Tequila ahead of time). Our particular hostess was cute as a button, and spoke very excellent English. Since we were the only gringos on the train, she made a point to stand near us and translate to English for us. Reserve seats near the center of the car. You eat, taste and learn a little about Tequila in a very fun environment. Afterwards, the booze starts flowing. It\\'s Mexico so you have to speak up to get good service, especially if you only know english as none of the servers speak a lick of English. I switched to beer to preserve my brain, but my wife had a La Paloma, which is a very popular refreshing type cocktail. Upon arrival, they directed all English speakers to load into a Mercedes passenger van instead of the bus. They all go to the same place so don\\'t worry about it. You\\'ll likely arrive ahead of the busses at the entrance to Jose Cuervo and there you will be greeted by two Mexican\\'s dressed in traditional Mayan garments. Being skeptical of packaged tours, I raised an eye brow and then promptly snapped a picture. English speakers are introduced to their tour guide, who walks you a short distance, showing the recommended restaurants near the distillery, and then tells you where to meet for your tour an hour and half later. If you have someone elderly in your party who can not walk briskly, they WILL get left behind. The tour guide was completely oblivious to the old Indian woman who couldn\\'t possibly keep up with the pack, so after we received instructions I found the family who was standing around wondering what the heck was going on and relayed to her son where and when to meet. Yep... you\\'re in Mexico. We wandered around the small town, which honestly is just like all other small Mexican towns... beautiful old churches, rows of tables with Mexicans selling worthless trinkets, phony MK purses and name brand athletic shoes and clothes. I even had a guy open up a brief case full of &quot;genuine&quot; Rolex and Armani watches at a remarkable discount. Un-huh. A little bored, we went to the gift shop, looked around and then settled down at the meeting place to watch our introductory movie. Get there early if you want a seat, it filled up fast. The movie reads like a Jose Cuervo advertisement, very corny, very Mexican. You then meet your tour guide, don your head nets and head off on the tour. The Distillery is actually very small, so the tour isn\\'t really that long. It ends in the cellar where only people what a purple wrist band (ours were white) could taste the Reserva de la Familia out of an oak cask. No worries, you\\'ll get yours on the way home. Overall, the tour is interesting enough and short enough that I wasn\\'t looking for the exit door. Afterwards, with a slight headache and a growling stomach, we decided to try one of the recommended restaurants right across the small street. Order the guacamole and the hostess will come make it in a mortar and pestle, right at your table side. Nice touch. I was surprised at how good the food was. We eventually wandered back toward the entrance and grabbed a seat at the covered stage. Again I was wondering what the &quot;show&quot; would be like but grabbing a couple of refreshing margaritas as I walked in helped. Get there a little early and there are a few cushions you can sit on. Not enough for everyone. The show was a lot of fun, involving Mariachi, excellent traditional dancing, and a demonstration of how the Agave cactus is cut up by hand with traditional tools. You are then directed to follow your original train hostess back to your bus, but since your a gringo, you\\'ll load into your van at the front of the pack. Back at the station, you run through security and board the train for your trip home. On the way home, you finally get a tasting of the Reserva de la Familia, which quite frankly is the good stuff... Tasting more like a an excellent Cognac than Tequila. You\\'ll get a few more snacks and once again the booze flows. At this point there is a lot of drunk happy Mexicans on the train... Good times. When you exit the station, walk out to the main road (past security) before summoning your Uber driver for the trip home. Not familiar with Uber? Well then get familiar soon and have an overseas data package for your smart phone. Taxis here are absolutely horrid. I have to give the trip five stars, even with the expensive ticket.

The organization at the Jose Cuervo distillery (included in the train price) was a bit unorganized, and because we were on the English tour, our schedule was changed last minute.

We were also supposed to have 2 hours in Tequila to explore, but with our schedule change, we ended up having 50 minutes, then the tour, then 50 more minutes which was not enough time to see anything.

As soon as we were seated in a very comfortable coach( the train is only about 2 years old) we were able to get drinks and they never stopped serving them. Food was served as well which was good. \\nMy only problem was that we were the only non-Spanish speaking people in the car, probably since it was summer and very few non-Spanish people anywhere in the Guadalajara area. The tour of the facility was in Spanish so they put the four of us with another group of seven English speaking people and we had a private English only tour, which was great.\\nIt appeared to us that if you understood Spanish there was much more information to be had. For example, we never got to see the &quot;reserva de  la familia cava&quot; described by someone else as very \\ncool. I am not sure if at other times of the year there are more English speaking people or not but just wanted to warn people that there was very little English spoken or understood.

You will have the opportunity to try the best tequila and delicious food with wonderful people who will make this trip an unforgettable one. 100% recommended, from start to finish, even if not tequila lover, is a unique experience.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Jose Cuervo Express", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/40/82/01/tren-jose-cuervo-express.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Washington 10", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "45609", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "153403411": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Even more than I expected", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d3338585-Reviews-Jose_Cuervo_Express-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/40/82/01/tren-jose-cuervo-express.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I had heard about this tour and thought that it would be a lot of fun, if a little loud and crazy.

The free-flowing margaritas were tasty, the bingo-like game on the train was fun (our friend even won the bottle of tequila!) and our greeting in Tequila with balloons, shots mariachis and a dancing horse was delightful. The actual tour of the distillery was very interesting, Afterwards, more margaritas - I recommend the tamarind ones - and then a delightful recreation of a traditional fiesta in a beautiful park and sculpture garden, The lunch provided was delicious, the entertainment excellent and the finale of a formal tequila tasting both informative and fun.

The original infrastructure was created by Manuel Tolsa (a renowned architect from Mexico City) as an orphanage to house thousands of kids, and it eventually housed old people and single mothers. There\\'s plenty of architectural and artistic beauties within the museum, but the most amazing are the murals of  Jose Clemente Orozco, who was famous for manipulating perspectives (different views of his paintings from different physical positions), and for embracing freedom and justice for humanity instead of easily aligning with political powers. I had never heard of Orozco before (just Diego Rivera, and David Siqueiros as famous Mexican mural painters), but his murals at the Hospicio Cabanas, and the Palacio de Gobierno in downtown Guadalajara still respectfully inspires our struggles for world\\'s freedom and human equality. I highly recommend to take a historic tour at the Museum to identify the true meanings (and perspective differences) from all the murals.

For those of you from the EUA, you might recall that about the same time a few civic structures, like the Coit Tower in San Francisco, were muralized by Rivera.  These were tumultuous times; great thinkers were pondering the merits of communism and fascism and these ideas are reflected in the murals of the 30s and 40s.\\n\\n     So in this hall, we find some amazing and pretty disturbing murals.  For example, the &quot;Man of Fire&quot; who is coiled in the dome, is most probably Mephistopheles. You will probably want to relax in this cool, dark space (its hot outside) and contemplate just what was going on in Orozco\\'s mind as he created this masterpiece.  \\n\\n    To turn this into the quintessential Mexican experience, you should arrive as the museum opens, at 10 AM.  As we did, I am sure you will find countless school children lined up to enjoy the museum.  We watched as each group took its turn forming a circle beneath the dome and then joining hands for a little game of Ring Around Diablo.  How does a second grade teacher explain these dark murals?  \\n\\n    The children all seemed to enjoy the murals, but like them, we got a big thrill towards the back where there is a Romanesque hall, each pie shaped panel painted with a color from the box that contains solomente 8 crayons...blue, green, red, etc.  the kids loved this room and so did we. \\n\\n    The instituto is famous for housing other exhibits.  Conservatorship takes on a new meaning in Guadalajara.  A lot of effort went into an exhibit celebrating the artistic value of beach trash (I\\'m not kidding.)  The other big exhibit displayed kitsch from the 1968 Olympics held in Mexico City.  I think we just missed the touring Jackson Pollock exhibition. \\n\\n      Sadly, this museum is a bit shabby.  If it was spruced up a bit, it could be even better.  As it is, it was an unforgettable experience.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Instituto Cultural Cabanas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/0d/c2/72/cupula-del-hospicio-cabanas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Paseo Hospicio 8 Colonia Centro", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "44100", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "270708201": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Hospicio Caba\\u00f1as", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d152607-Reviews-Instituto_Cultural_Cabanas-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/0d/c2/72/cupula-del-hospicio-cabanas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Great architectural design perfectly conserved.

It was built at the beginning of the 19th century by the Archbishop Caba\\u00f1as as a shelter for orphans, old people and invalids. It remained in activity until 1972, when it was transformed into a cultural centre and a museum. In 1987 it was entered into the list of the \\u201cWorld Heritage\\u201d sites of UNESCO. The building currently hosts important artistic events and political meetings at top international level\\n\\nThe complex is immense, with many courtyards surrounded by arcades and large rooms for collective use, like in a convent or a college. There are two large chapels, but they are not any more in use. The style is sober neoclassic and the complex is impressively grandiose. \\n\\nThe main reason for visiting the hospice are the murals painted by Clemente Orozco in the so-called \\u201cgreat chapel\\u201d; the chapel is as large as a church and there are 53 murals, painted in 1936-39; they cover all the available space within the chapel, including the vaults and the dome. These murals are considered the best work of Orozco, and the chapel is currently nicknamed \\u201cthe Sistine Chapel of the Americas\\u201d. They represent events of the Mexican history and issues related to the Mexican society. Like many other works of Orozco, these murals do not conceal their political, ideological and educational intent, but they are nevertheless enjoyable for their extraordinary pictorial quality. \\n\\nAnother reason for visiting the Hospicio is the wealth of excellent temporary exhibitions that are organized there. At the time of my visit there were three: a collection of works of Dr. Atl; a retrospective of M\\u00e1ximo Gonz\\u00e1lez works (mainly installations); an exhibition of modern paintings on the theme \\u201cthe current millennium seen by the artists\\u201d. All three exhibition were of very high quality. \\n\\nThe Hospice is in central Guadalajara, at the east-end of the immense Plaza Tapat\\u00eda. It is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except on Monday. Admission is 70 Pesos (about 5 US $) plus 25 Pesos for taking pictures. Infrastructures include toilets and many seats. The visit can take one hour or more, depending on the exhibitions in progress. The beautiful Plaza Tapat\\u00eda, in front of the hospice, is also worth a visit. There are many big bronze sculptures by Alejandro Colunga representing imaginary personages, animals or other objects in a surrealistic context; the sculpture are so designed as to be usable as benches. This installation is called \\u201cthe hall of the wizards\\u201d, is very beautiful and people like taking a &quot;selfie&quot; while sitting on the lap of someone of these strange &quot;aliens&quot;.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Instituto Cultural Cabanas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/0d/c2/72/cupula-del-hospicio-cabanas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Paseo Hospicio 8 Colonia Centro", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "44100", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "257863163": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful Building &amp; Murals - but disappointing modern art.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d152607-Reviews-Instituto_Cultural_Cabanas-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/0d/c2/72/cupula-del-hospicio-cabanas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Go on a Tuesday - its free!

While I was there I asked for and got a private tour of the paintings. I didn\\'t take any pictures because I didn\\'t think I could do justice to this place. Instead I opted to purchase a book in the bookstore. On the tour the guide explained Orozco\\'s play on perspective and his sarcastic attitude towards the Spanish conquest, the Catholic Church and the Mexican Government. If you view the paintings from different points in the room some of the paintings seem to change. Truly amazing. Its a must do.  But take my word for it, asking for a tour is the best way to see this. I\\'ve been there 3 times and got more this time by taking the tour then I ever could on my own.  Enjoy!  \\n\\nAlso don\\'t forget to go to Palicio Del Gobierno near Catedral. It has the largest Orozco painting I have ever seen.

Many of the restaurants in Chapala, Ajijic, and other villages on the northern shore are excellent and very resaonably priced, and there are many more proportionally than in other small villages, due no doubt to the large expat population, of which I am one.

We recently spent a week of vacation just outside of Ajijic on the north shore of Laguna Chapala.\\nWe flew into Guadalajara from Tijuana - there is now a very good entry bridge taking you directly into the TJ airport from the US side of the border.  The plane fare from there was about half of the cost from San Diego.  The airport is nice and the flight was great.\\nArriving in Guadalajara, we were met by a driver from the agency we rented our car from.  We used a service based in Ajijic which can be found via web search.  The driver took us to Ajijic where we took over the car, proceeded to the local Walmart (in the center of Ajijic) for provisions, and then on to our casita rental out of town.\\nDuring our week stay, we spent two days visiting Guadalajara, one day touring the town of Tequila, and another driving to a mountain town above the south side of the lake.\\nAll of our activities were enjoyable and we drove to all except a tour of the historical center of Guadalajara.  Driving was fairly tame by international standards and we didn\\'t have any problems.  The quality of the roads varies from outstanding to abysmal.  In rural areas, the frequent use of speed bumps requires constant vigilance to prevent vehicle damage.\\nMy wife is always concerned that travel in Mexico is dangerous.  Even she agrees, however, that we never felt even a hint of any danger during the entirety of our trip.  Yes, we did see heavily armed federales/military from time to time, but never any of the bad guys they must be protecting against.  On the contrary, our experiences with the locals were very pleasant throughout (I do speak fair Spanish).\\nThe most pleasant surprise was the strength of the dollar.  The peso was valued at just about 5 cents during our visit.  This meant that most everything we bought was very inexpensive compared to US standards.  Especially on food and drink (our primary expenditures) the prices were great.  At the best restaurants in town, we we able to have a 3 course meal with wine for around $40 for the two of us.  Meals we would expect to cost $100+ at home.  And for the most part, the food was excellent.  Our only complaint was that most of the menu options were steak or seafood that we could get at home.  There were surprisingly few offerings of what I would call traditional Mexican cuisine.  \\nThis may be due to the fact that Ajijic is the hub of American/Canadian expatriate housing in this part of Mexico.  Apparently some 30,000 expats make their homes in the area.  We met a fair number and all reported loving the area and having no intention of returning to the US or Canada (including the American owner in the house above our casita).\\nTips for visiting the area are to do some good research in advance.  We stayed around 20 minutes out of town (Ajijic) in a lovely and inexpensive casita with a beautiful view of the lake (through Airbnb).  Were we to go again, I would probably stay in town for the convenience of walking to stores and restaurants.  If you drive (and probably even if you don\\'t), travel with some form of GPS map.  Navigating Guadalajara would have been very hard without a cell phone map and getting around in rural areas needs guidance as well.  I would also try to see if you can get a map which shows exactly where desired restaurants, stores, etc. are located.  In many small Mexican towns, the streets within the towns are very narrow, made of cobblestones and have limited parking.  There were a couple restaurants we wanted to try but didn\\'t because we had no idea how find them.  Unfortunately, few of the places we wanted to patronize could be found on Google maps or through a Google search.\\nAjijic is not a place for nightlife.  Most of the restaurants close by 9:00 on weekdays and when we were there (October) everything was very quiet except for Saturday and Sunday nights when the Mexicans were out and about with families.\\nWill we go again?  Maybe.  I love travelling in Mexico, but there are many other places in the world (and Latin America) that we want to visit.  I wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend a visit to the area. \\nI almost forgot to mention the weather.  We decided it\\'s very close to perfect.  A touch warm in the day if you are in the sun, a touch cool in the evening if there is a moderate breeze, but mostly just right Goldilocks!\\nTwo thumbs up for Mexico, Mexicans, and the greater Guadalajara area.  Yo big D, take your beautiful wall and put it where the sun don\\'t shine!\\nEnjoy your travels wherever they take you!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Romantic Lake Chapala", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/15/ad/f8/e3/embarcadero-donde-se.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "424872571": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Perfect place to spend a evening with friends", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d2152182-Reviews-Romantic_Lake_Chapala-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/15/ad/f8/e3/embarcadero-donde-se.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Had a good time good food good ice cream we also enjoyed a boat ride to alacran island, plan to come back next year can\\'t wait", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Romantic Lake Chapala", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/15/ad/f8/e3/embarcadero-donde-se.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "422562294": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nice and Relax", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d2152182-Reviews-Romantic_Lake_Chapala-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/15/ad/f8/e3/embarcadero-donde-se.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "All the attractions are relaxing to the point you will not want to leave this place!\\nLake Chapala is a beautiful nature gift, you can go over in a boat, there is a dock where you can rent this tour and have a great time with your friends.\\nThe breeze is something you will enjoy, careful because you can get dizzy, if you are not good in water tours, you better stay in ground.

You may want to check them out when you\\'re in the area.\\n\\nTHE OLD CRUSHING MILL\\nThere was once an operating gold mine in the hills just above Ajijic. While the old mine itself is too dangerous to enter, you can visit the ruins of the crushing mill (see location below). This is on private property, but there\\'s no fence, and a family living on the premises unhesitatingly gave us permission to wander both inside and outside the decrepit buildings. Outside there\\'s a long, sturdy earthen ramp where ore-laden wagons were pulled up to the crusher. It would be very interesting to visit this place with someone knowledgeable about mining.\\n\\nLA CASA DE LA RUSA\\nThis was the home of a mysterious horsewoman who rode around dressed all in black while being swindled out of the proceeds of the gold mine mentioned above. The house is located at 26 Independencia, where the number plaque shows the silhouette of the legendary Horsewoman in Black. Her name was Ayenara Zara Alexeyewa, a Russian ballerina, and according to Judy King\\'s blog she and her dance partner/foster brother bought the above-mentioned gold mine in the 1920s \\u201choping to fulfill their dreams to produce and present great Russian ballets here in Mexico.\\u201d Jim and Carole Cook say the mine was called La Misericordia and La Rusa was being swindled by her Mexican partners until mine manager Quilocho Retolaza came to her rescue. Quilocho had been one of Pancho Villa\\'s most dashing officers and La Rusa herself (under the pen name Frances De Brundige) tells the story of how he saved her from swindlers and bandits in the book &quot;Quilocho and the Dancing Stars,&quot; available (used) from Amazon.com. There are lots of old photos and memorabilia about Zara Alexeyewa in La Nueva Posada\\'s Restaurante La Rusa.\\n\\nLA VIEJA POSADA\\nThis famous old restaurant was built in the 1500s and has had many reincarnations. Today it is called Restaurante Mar\\u00eda Isabel. Here, says Jorge Varela, is where D. H. Lawrence (and later many other famous artists) used to stop by for a Tequila and Sangrita. The correct procedure for imbibing these two drinks, said our companions, is not to mix them together, but to sip first one and then the other. Now for this ceremony, the tequila must be blanco while the sangrita is red. When I asked what was in the sangrita, I immediately learned what\\'s not in it: alcohol. After that, I got a different version of the ingredients from each of my friends and every source I checked. I guess that means you\\'ll always be surprised when you drink it!\\n\\nD.H. LAWRENCE\\'S ROOM\\nThis is in the town of Chapala, at number 307 Zaragoza Street, and is now known as Quinta Quetzalcoatl Boutique Hotel B&amp;B. \\u201cThis is where Lawrence stayed while he lived in Chapala,\\u201d said the owner, Rob Cracknell, an Australian painter, who kindly showed us all around. Well, QQ, as they call it in Chapala, turned out to be one of the most gorgeous places to stay I had ever seen, with beautiful trees, fountains, grottos, flowers and cacti. In the middle of the patio was a charming pool with a serpent motif, shaped with secluded nooks and a jacuzzi. Lawrence\\'s room was just as attractive. On the wall was a picture of the writer and his wife Frieda, along with the text of the telegram Lawrence sent her in 1923: \\u201cChapala Paradise. Take evening train.\\u201d The train is long gone, but \\u201cChapala Paradise\\u201d still says it all.\\n\\nHow to get there:\\nIn Ajijic: The Crushing mill (N20 17.892 W103 16.303) is at the south end of Flores Mag\\u00f3n.  La Casa de la Rusa is at 26 Independencia (N20 17.877 W103 15.887), between Aquiles Serd\\u00e1n and 5 de Mayo. La Vieja Posada, now called Restaurante Mar\\u00eda Isabel, is located at the south end of Morelos street at N20 17.828 W103 15.756.\\n\\nIn Chapala:  Quinta Quetzalcoatl is number 307 near the south end of Zaragoza Street, just south of Ni\\u00f1os Heroes (N20 17.299 W103 11.467).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Romantic Lake Chapala", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/15/ad/f8/e3/embarcadero-donde-se.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "420586400": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d2152182-Reviews-Romantic_Lake_Chapala-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/15/ad/f8/e3/embarcadero-donde-se.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Lake Chapala is a very beautiful place approximately 45 minute drive from Guadalajara.

Some might say this is too much, but we managed to keep busy.  Seven of those nights was spent four short blocks down Corona from the Catedral.  \\n    \\n   Cathedrals can be peculiar.  Some are tucked into neighborhoods in such a way that you really can\\'t see them very well.  Others are extremely cluttered inside.  The catedral in Guadalajara has to rank as one of the top visually from the outside.  It is surrounded by large plazas on three sides and a leafy memorial on the fourth.  Hence, if you enjoy looking at striking buildings you could not be better pleased.  Whoever came up with the concept for this building was a genius.  Two domes, one larger than the other and two matching spires.  As you walk around the catedral, these four elements rearrange themselves to provide an unlimited number of interesting looks.  \\n\\n    Both the Plaza de Armas and the Plaza de Liberacion provide unlimited opportunities for people watching.\\n\\n    The inside of the church is OK.  Its a large church, very nice, not disorganized like some cathedrals.  There\\'s a crypt in which you can pay your respects to the bishops of the past.   \\n\\n    While the inside is really just OK, the outside grows on you.  On one of our days we visited the basilica in Zapopan.  We had to ask advice in Spanish to catch the bus back to El Centro.  The bus wound around town and I gotta tell you, my heart soared like an \\u00e1guila when I saw those two spires out the front of the bus.

Let me start by telling you the pain it was  getting to the stadium. We took an uber from around the expo area and left two hours prior to the start of the game, it took us an hour to get there because all of the congestion and because there is no public transit that can take you to the hotel doors. If you take public transit you still need to walk 15-20min to make it to the gate. So make sure you leave with lots of time to spare. \\n\\nGetting in to the stadium was easy, security screening was fast and friendly, hats off to the crew for expediting and handling the large crowds effectively. \\n\\nOverall the stadium is very modern, large access ways, lots of concessions, and no major lines for anything. Beers are overpriced at 90 pesos (5 dollars) for a 24oz draft cup of tecate light or indio, as Estadio Jalisco has them for 60 pesos, Food is great, you have tortas, lonches, tacos, pizza, hotdogs in the 45-70 pesos range. \\n\\nThe stadium has lots of security and although we went to the game versus the rival team, we never felt threatened in any way, and people wore the opposing team jersey without any trouble rather than the normal fan heckling, unlike CU-Pumas Stadium were you wear that jersey under your own risk.\\n\\nThe seats are numbered and they are comfortable, lots of ushers, and you need to flash your ticket at all times. \\n\\nBathrooms are ample and clear, even had soap!  The stadium also has a number of souvenirs and stands were you find all sorts of Chivas gear.\\n\\nExiting the stadium is also a very painful experience as we need to take a but that dropped us off on the side of the main street to catch a cab. Forget taking an uber, as it is a mess with tons of people, although we waited 30-40min after the game ended to leave the stadium.\\n\\nOverall the stadium is very fun place to catch a game, have some drinks, and enjoy the crowd!\\n\\nOther than the expensive beer and the very poor logistics of getting in/out of the stadium, the stadium is worth a visit.\\n\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Estadio Omnilife", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/59/d1/fc/estadio-omnilife.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Zapopan", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "564666380": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful Stadium, good atmosphere.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d2227223-Reviews-Estadio_Omnilife-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/59/d1/fc/estadio-omnilife.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The stadium is outside the city, it is definitely a ride away.

The roller coaster with the VR (familia monster) is so awesome that we played it twice. The go-karting is also real fun. Other things are ok too. The only downside was that two of the amazing roller coasters (bullet and tornado) were out of service due to renovation and maintenance.

We were all really excited. I love history, great stories, and visiting attractions such as these. A cemetery can tell you a lot about a culture, and this one in particular is interesting because of its age, as well as its proximity to an old hospital, medical school, autopsy lab, experimental lab for infectious diseases, etc.  \\n\\nMy problem is not with the Panteon de Belen itself, but with the TOUR.  \\n\\nWe got tickets for the 11:30PM tour... you\\'ve got to get there around 7PM to get the tickets. The government\\'s website for the attraction says that adults pay $62.50 pesos.  When we got there, we paid something like 77 pesos. \\n\\nThe place itself, is incredible, I really want to go back during the day; however, the tour was really boring and frustrating for me, as my Spanish is quite poor. Generally, if someone is speaking clearly, properly, and not too quickly, I can completely get the gist of what\\'s being said. I would expect that kind of guide on a tour run by gov\\'t. While I thought this tour guide was good, and everyone seemed to love her, she spoke in local slang (according to my family here) and very quickly, making 4 words sound like 1. \\n\\nMy biggest problem with the tour, actually, was the size of the group. There were about 50 of us. I don\\'t know the exact max # of people allowed on a tour, but I think that 20 should be the max for an event like this. When I was able to get close enough to the guide to see her use of her hands to describe things, see her speak, I was better able to understand things. However, when I couldn\\'t get physically close to her, it was pretty hopeless for me. There were about a half dozen stops around the Panteon, and on about half of them, we were told to leave our flashlights OFF.  I couldn\\'t really see anything interesting at that point, so I had to stand and wait, usually for about 20 minutes till we got moving to the next stop.\\n\\nSome of the stuff the guide was saying (as translated by my wife) was pretty bogus, and mostly just spooky fun for young people... that a vampire died there, and they buried him under a pomegranate tree, and they say that it\\'s his blood that taints the fruit of the tree... pretty dumb. Or they pointed out that you could see the image of a man among the efflorescence stains of the masonry wall, about 15 feet above ground. Just ridiculous stuff. \\n\\nOther things sounded really cool, and I really regret that I didn\\'t take a tour in English, even at a much higher expense. There are other stories that I could share here, like the one about the baby who\\'s buried above ground, but I won\\'t spoil it for you because hopefully you speak Spanish better than I do, or have the good sense to ask for a tour in your native language. \\n\\nIf you\\'re in my boat, and you\\'re more interested in the place itself, as opposed to a &quot;spooky midnight tour of a cemetery,&quot; go and see it during the day.  If, however, you insist on seeing it at night, BRING A FLASHLIGHT (the crappy ones that they sell there for 20 pesos are HORRIBLE, basically good for seeing things in your closet at home, not a cemetery at night), and note... at night you may NOT use any cameras, including your cell phone. During the day, you may take photos, but without a flash.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Panteon de Belen", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/99/ce/79/filename-panteon-de-belen.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Belen 684 Centro", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "44280", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "631785550": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Full of history.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d1192522-Reviews-Panteon_de_Belen-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/99/ce/79/filename-panteon-de-belen.jpg", "datePublished": "November 7, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is a very old cemetery located in downtown Guadalajara full of really old gravestones.

As such, we were two blocks away from the largest street in the center of the city, 16 Septiembre, which runs north past the Iglesia San Francisco (the large church that once served as the city\\'s Cathedral.  As we were using public transportation (not necessarily a great idea in GDL) we were obligated to catch a bus.  This turned out to be very easy.  Simply wait beside the church and watch for the blue TUR bus marked Zapopan.  The TUR buses cost 12 pesos and are modern comfortable coaches.  \\n\\n    We waited for less than 10 minutes for our bus and were lucky to find seats; it is between four and five miles across the city and the ride took almost half an hour..\\n\\n     It was easy to identify the correct place to disembark.  We had passed the distinctive Arcos de Zapopan and a few moments later virtually all the passengers stood and got off.  \\n\\n    We found ourselves across the street for a large public space, perhaps 100 meters on a side.  At the west end, with the morning sun shining on its light stone facade, was the basilica.  The large park is certainly worthy of mention.  There is a central gazebo from which expands  a myriad of trails laid out in a geometric pattern, Raised beds with a variety of plantings and statuary rise beside these pathways.  \\n\\n    We nabbed a bench near the gazebo and ate our chocolate croissant.  For neighbors we had a caballero with his string base, obviously waiting, in full regalia, for his mariachi assignment.  While we waited, a young man came a long selling tamales, so we had one of those, as well.\\n\\n    Soon it was time to go go to the basilica.  With its facade bearing two towers, it looks just like many mexican churches, a smaller version of the  Catedral on the zocalo in Mexico City.  On our way in we passed a group dressed in Indian garb, perhaps Huichols associated with the small museum. \\n\\n    Inside, the church was not particularly distinctive.  It was well lit and well attended.  And here is the point: this is a very significant pilgrimage church.  As we made our way to the entrance, there were pilgrims making their what across the courtyard on their knees.  Inside there were more pilgrims scooting towards the altar.   Everyone in the church was praying quietly.\\n\\n    Above the altar was the small statue of Mary who was the object of adoration.  As the guide books tell you, tis is a pretty small statue. Once a year, she is removed from the altar and paraded to the cathedral in el centro and back again.  \\n\\n   To return to the center we needed to take another bus.  This one stopped beside the catedral, across the street from where we were let off.  And it did not say &quot;Centro&quot;.  I asked one of the ohters waiting for the bus and she wrote down the names of two buses.  We caught the one marked &quot;El Nilo.&quot;  This luxurious TUR coach wandered through city streets for a long while and we were extremely glad when we saw the two spires of the catedral rising in front of the El Nilo bus.\\n\\n     So there you have it.  If you find the religiosity of a pilgrimmage church to be compelling, you will not want to miss the Basilica de Zapopan.  There are a few other things in el centro Zapopan to fill out your day which we will cover in a separate post.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Basilica de Zapopan", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/f5/1e/61/basilica-de-zapopan.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av Hidalgo at Calle Morelos Zapopan, Jal.", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "45100", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "260436363": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful Cathedral", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d184229-Reviews-Basilica_de_Zapopan-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/f5/1e/61/basilica-de-zapopan.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The cathedral is beautiful and close to a corredor where there are nice bars, museum and activities to have a nice evening with friends and family.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Basilica de Zapopan", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/f5/1e/61/basilica-de-zapopan.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av Hidalgo at Calle Morelos Zapopan, Jal.", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "45100", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "249318491": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Sensational architecture ", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d184229-Reviews-Basilica_de_Zapopan-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/f5/1e/61/basilica-de-zapopan.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This church, located in the Zapopan district, is one of the most beautiful churches I\\'ve seen thus far in Mexico.

It is an unassuming two story building of tortured stone with a discreet balcony facing the plaza.  The building was completed by the spanish in the mid 18th Century. \\n\\n      As we entered from the Plaza de Armas, we were obliged to sign the register, but there was no fee.  A few steps and we turned up the staircase to the right.  Immediately Sandra and i were confronted with what may be the most startling, most dramatic mural i will ever see.  Overhead in the stairwell, Orozco painted Father Hidalgo.   Eyes turned to heaven, one fist raised and one bearing a fiery brand, Hidalgo here is a man possessed. such was the power of this mural, that I was stopped dead in my tracks.\\n\\n    Manuel Hidalgo is credited with starting the Mexican Revolution.  He gave the grito, the cry for freedom, in a small village near Guanajuato on September 16, 1810. (This date is applied to the main street in Guadalajara centro and around the country.)  He raised an army, fought to the very outskirts of Mexico city and mysteriously turned back.  He came to Guadalajara and occupied this very building, where he lived for two short months.  During that time he formed a provisional government which outlawed slavery, eliminated fees payed by tenants to landowners and eliminated takes on alcohol and tobacco.  Although this government was not exactly in charge of the country, the Mexicans hold these documents sacred.  \\n\\n   Hidalgo set off on his revolutionary quest at the end of the year and met his death shortly thereafter.  His statue graces the Plaza de la Liberacion in front of the catedral, and many public squares through out the country.  \\n\\n    In the spirit in which Orozco painted (that of the 1930s) Hidalgo is flanked by symbols of those time, communists, Nazis and destruction.  It is quite horrific.  While we were standing there, a group of chicos wandered in and I posed them with the mural, providing an interesting contrast.\\n\\n    At the top of the stairs we walked around to the hall of congress, where we sat in a the seats which I assume are still used by the representatives of the state government.  there is another Orozco mural over the podium.  Here we see a statesmanlike Hidalgo signing the bill that abolishes slavery, below Benito Juarez is signing a document labeled reform. \\n\\n    Around the front is a very pleasant room with excellent portraits of important leaders of Guadalajara and the nation.  There is nice stained glass and furnishings and view onto and that balcony I mentioned at the beginning, with the Plaza de Armas below.

The downtown area is beautiful with its cathedral, plazas and churches. Amidst all of this is the Palacio de Gobierno. This is a beautiful government building in its own right and it is the congressional building of the state. It has several mid sized courtyards, several levels and also holds a museum. The museum is very interesting \\'but\\' as is normal all through Mexico there is no English language signage. However the palacio itself hosts two Orozco murals and they are beautiful...one \\'The people and its leaders\\' is huge and is to be seen on the main stairwell and the other of \\'Hidalgo,\\' the George Washington of Mexico, is in the congress hall. Both are very impressive pieces of mural art and Mexico simply has some of the best in the world. I loved the artwork and I loved the building, well worth a visit and the best thing is that there are a host of other great sights to see in this part of GDL. \\n\\nPROS\\nFree entry...toilets...nice building...interesting museum...great murals!\\nCONS\\nNo English signage in the museum...\\n\\nIt does lose a star because of the single \\'con\\' I outlined.

This is such an amazing place and it is within the city. I had never expected that my lovely city had such a hike nearby. I\\u2019ve been living in Seattle for years, where people talk with pride about all the lovely hikes around. Never had I imagined that my own city had such a hidden jewel only half an hour away from my mom\\u2019s house.\\n\\nLa Barranca offers some beautiful views of the Rio Lerma-Santiago. It goes through a beautiful canyon like view. It makes you feel great to be out there while doing a walk or a hike. The simple fact of being out in nature with such amazing views is inspiring.\\n\\nSome amazing friends kindly provided advice on how to approach the hike at the Barranca. It truly helped me, so I will outline it here for those who are interested in giving it a try. I know for sure that I will do this hike again soon, as I truly enjoyed it. I exercise regularly and when I have an opportunity to get my cardio in with an outdoor activity it is rewarding and more entertaining. Hate being in place looking at my reflection on a mirror for long periods of time.\\n\\nHere are the tips to get the most out of the hike at La Barranca de Huentitan, which I truly recommend doing!\\n\\n1. Get there early in the morning to complete the hike before it gets incredibly hot. We got there at 6am at the beginning of March. The way down is rocky and slippery. It was hard to see because it was still dark. I would recommend getting there exactly at sunrise. Check when sunrise is going to be and start at that time.\\n\\n2. The way down takes approximately an hour and fifteen minutes. We all used sports shoes that can take on outdoors. There are a lot of rocks and it is slippery, so I would recommend taking an appropriate pace on the way down.\\n\\n3. Once you get all the way to the bottom at river level, you will get to Y like intersection. You can either take a left or a right.\\n- If you take a left you will get to the bridge which has amazing views of the river and the canyon. The bridge is about 1.5km away from where you start. \\n- If you take a right you will get to the uphill railway, which is the demanding part of this hike.\\n\\nWe personally took a left first and checked out the bridge. Which I truly recommend doing. If you are tight on time, then you can go straight to the right and get to the uphill railway.\\n\\n4. For the uphill railway you must be very careful of where you step as you go up. I recommend brining sunblock and of course hydration. The hike is not easy. It is demanding if you are not used to it. There is part that is incredibly inclined, and you must use your hands to help yourself up. I recommend bringing gloves to prevent getting scratches, cuts and pull yourself up. Also, it is important to wear gloves in case there is any sort of bug. I must call out that there can sometimes be scorpions behind the rails, so just be careful about that. Nothing to worry about. Just common sense.\\n\\n5. Most people call out taking about an hour and a half to get all the way to the top. I would say this is a fair assessment if you decide to take breaks. Hydrate yourself, eat a granola bar, have a banana. The main objective is to have fun, exercise and enjoy. Don\\u2019t try to push it to hard if you need a break. You\\u2019ll improve your times as you become more experienced.\\n\\n6. There are parts of the hike where there are openings between the rails. Make sure that you are very careful as you go through these parts of the hike. Do not want to fall and end up injuring yourself.\\n\\n7. There are 3-4 ways out as you are going up. That will take you to the same dirt road that brought you down. Have to call out though that once you start the biggest incline you are stuck in the path and have to finish or go back down. At this point though it is totally worth it to just finish. It is the most demanding but most fun part of the hike.\\n\\n8. You can stop at any point to take pictures. Just make sure that if you are in a big incline that you sit down and turn around. You do not want to end up falling and rolling down for several meters.\\n\\n9. Once you make it all the way to the top feel proud of yourself. You\\u2019ve made it. On your way out make sure to stop by the fruit stands to get a refreshing reward. There are stands that sell coconut water mixed with pineapple juice. It is called \\u201cCoco pi\\u00f1a\\u201d. Totally recommend it. Refreshing and delicious.\\n\\nIt takes a total of 3 hours to complete the entire journey at a pretty good and safe pace. Make sure to get out there and give it a try. If you are from Guadalajara, this is a more entertaining way to exercise. If you are visiting and have the time, make sure to enjoy this fun and beautiful hike to add something different to your experience. I know that I will try to do this as often as possible.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Barranca de Oblatos", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/06/85/59/photo0jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calzada Independencia Huentit\u00e1n", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "44390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "555210979": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Great for Hiking", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d153221-Reviews-Barranca_de_Oblatos-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/06/85/59/photo0jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Beautiful ravine!

We ran down (careful because of the rocks and pebbles) and along the river towards the bridge (Puente Arcediano). Even near and on the bridge people were doing fitness, taekwondo, etc. We ran back a kilometer or so along the other side of the river until the path became narrower and people told us there was no bridge further upstream. We thus backtracked the same route and uphill until we were completely exhausted, soaked, and dried out. Luckily my bag was still there and I gulped my electrolyte drinks and put on dry clothes.. Completely upstairs, we bought big glasses of fresh juices (jugo) and took an Uber ride back to the hotel.\\n\\nAlthough there are quite a few stalls selling drinks at the start and the first kilometer, there might only be one or two people selling drinks lower down into the canyon and none at the bridge.

There is lots food at the top, Lechuguillas is a local specialty, Cactus juice, and you can even get 3 for 10 pesos as of June 2016. They come in 500ml and are great when you down in the canyon.  The river down there is somewhat smelly unfortunately.  Definitely no swimming in there.  I would advice a small day pack with 1.5 to 2L of water and some lechuguillas for sugar and energy, as well as Chocolate or palanquetas (bars with peanuts, amaranto, and honey) for energy.  Good walking shoes, the cobble stones give you a good run in your ankles, so good to take some firm shoes.  I even went down to the middle with my niece, 7 years old and was fine to do all herself.  We also went Summer (rainy season) so everything was green, river flowing and nice warmish weather.

Barranca de Oblatos (English: Oblatos Canyon), also known as Barranca de Huentit\\u00e1n, is a canyon carved by the R\\u00edo Grande de Santiago in Mexico in the state of Jalisco. It lies on the northeast side of the municipality of Guadalajara and on the edge of the municipalities of Tonal\\u00e1, Zapotlanejo, Ixtlahuac\\u00e1n del R\\u00edo and Zapopan in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area. Its beauty and structure make it a slightly smaller scale version of the Grand Canyon in the United States, and Barranca del Cobre in Chihuahua.[1]\\n\\nIt includes approximately 1.137 hectares and it has an average depth of 600 meters. The difference in elevation between the rim of the canyon (1.520 msnm) and the river (1.000 mvsl) is 520 meters (1,706 feet) at the point of a funicular. This canyon is also named Oblatos-Huentit\\u00e1n due to the areas in the city crossed by it, called Oblatos and Huentit\\u00e1n respectively.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Barranca de Oblatos", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/06/85/59/photo0jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calzada Independencia Huentit\u00e1n", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "44390", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "242620632": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "STEEP!

Performance aside, I would see anything just to get the chance to sit in the theatre.  There are some cons with where you sit though.  With the flamenco dancers, they needed to set up a special stage that went pretty far back into the back stage, that if you sat on the sides of the theatre, you couldn\\'t see anything.  My wife and I were on the second level 14 seats from the front, and we couldn\\'t see anything, so the staff moved us to the private balconies that overlooked the stage directly and we loved it.  Although, other perormances that use the main stage, you should be able to see no problem... But plan accordingly.  The theatre itself has a little cafe in front, for those that are visiting and just want to sit and people watch in the square outside the theatre.  Inside the theatre, there is 4 balconies that go all the way to the high dome shaped sealing with beautiful frescos.  All I can say, is this is a must do in Guadalajara.

The lady (of a certain age) did not speak much English, but she did have tickets (lots of them, as it turned out) and a seating chart.  She also had a brochure that showed what was playing.  Of course, this was in Spanish.  I caught &quot;Daphne and Chloe&quot; which didn\\'t mean too much to me.  As chiefly we wanted to see something (anything) in this famous theater, I successfully negotiated for two tickets.  With the help of her seating chart, the nice lady sold me dos billetas, 8 rows back from the stage on the left aisle.  We could have had the center, but opted for the chance at quick escape.  \\n\\n    The price was 200 pesos each.  Divide by 14.4 (what the dollar was exchanging just a couple blocks away) and you realize that we purchased tickets for Teatro Degollado for about 15 USD each.  To put this in perspective, it is more than likely that i am going to pay 20 USD to watch my neighbor sing in the ballroom of the local Sheraton. (Now there is a good reason to get an aisle seat!)\\n\\n    On Sunday, we made our way to the teatro under a blazing noon sun.  Inside we were dazzled by the handsome foyer white columns and several stories up a Tiffany glass ceiling. Tres elegant. The theater is as billed.  Patterned after La Scalla, it has five vertical tiers of seating that surround the main floor and the stage.  the ceiling is an amazing work of art, characters in classic costume make the circuit, in the center a brilliant glass oculus.   Just being here made me feel special.  \\n\\n    As Sandra and i got situated, she noted that we would not be permitted to take pictures during the performance.  (Actually, a fellow in front of us used his tablet, which seemed pretty impolite.  I don\\'t think he was from the EUA.)  Partly in response to the upcoming ban, we took lots of pictures of this remarkable theater.  \\n\\n   While taking pictures, we noted the piano on stage and tumbled to the idea that at least the first half would be a piano concerto.  This is a classic tourist in Mexico moment.  I mean, how likely would it be that you would attend a concert and not know that you were going to see a major pianist.  Not only that, but we had purchased the best seats in the house to watch that pianist. For a pittance, we were able to watch the fingers of Olivier Chauzu (he\\'s French)  dance across the keys and in the mirror like surface of the keyboard backing.\\n\\n     At any rate, we had a great time.  It was good for us to attend the matinee.  Most of the performances (just like anywhere) are at night.  I personally feel more comfortable being of the street by 8 PM when I am in Mexico, although this may say more about me than it does about the safety of this Mexican city.  \\n\\n   In addition to the Jalisco Symphony, the theater also presents ballet and other performances.  i would highly recommend you attend a performance in this remarkable theater.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Teatro Degollado", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/35/ed/2f/teatro-degollado.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av.

I have even seen a teenager lay down on the floor  and sleep throughout a concert out of boredom.  why are the parents  dragging these people to classical concerts  if they have no interest to see it/ ?    ;   another huge problem is the extremely heavy  cheap  perfume most of these Mexican women  wear in the audience, its not uncommon for me with my asthma  to have to change seats  4 times  or more to get away from the : force field :  that these ladies give out permanently  and which cause me and many others to not be able to breathe.  I have been coming to this concert hall since the 1980s  and  the problem with audience poor and horrible behavior  just keeps getting worse and worse.   the shows are of a high quality  and the philharmonic  tries  their best but the audience often and I mean often, ruins the whole spectating  experience.   I have a large booming  voice and my Spanish is pretty good but if I started to discipline these people  it would lead to a large  scene.   also I find the  philharmonic  to be very &quot;  self congratulatory&quot;   ; they are only doing their jobs , there is nothing so great about having performed up to their paid positions. also the programs  tend to be a bit too short  and then they self congratulate obviously as if there is so much wonderful about just doing their job.  however there is not much cultural to do here in gdl. that is walkable to downtown  and  I still go despite the many adversities and  horrible  audience behavior.    for example, at  the NUTCRACKER for Christmas, a woman  next to me with her child on her lap  insisted to speak THROUGHOUT the whole show to her child about  the concert and completely ruined m y experience  though I kept  asking her to shut up.   I then requested and even received a  full refund from my credit card for the seat  as the whole experience was a disaster and the staff of the usher s did nothing to  stop this woman.   If you go to  their shows here be prepared to have to move your seat many times due to the molestations  ( molestias) of your fellow seat mates in that area.    Lately I notice that the ushers are indeed  disciplining the audience more. I think the theatre needs to post a list in Spanish of the rules and regs. about behavior in a professional aspiring  theatre.    I think the mex.  audience  really doesn\\'t know how to behave on a international  basis and needs to be taught and  instructed to shut up and stifle their children  during these  otherwise nice performances.     \\n\\nSince  most of the viewing  experiences are ruined  by the seatmates around you  it is good that the price for the shows is not too much given the often ruined  experiences  .  If you can get the discount then go.  If you have to pay full fare  beware of where you are sitting and if the neighbours are their usual unruly and poorly behaved  selves be prepared to &quot; jump seats&quot;  often and  early !

I just noticed that it is one and the same  as Glorieta Chapalita as I now know that it is officially named.  So having them next to each other on the same page needs to be combined.  Since I posted 5 of the six pictures, I see that I need to return and take some more pictures!  The park has become even more enjoyable since the officials of Colonia Chapalita have made better street crossings for the busy Sunday art show and sale that keeps growing each year.  New restaurants have opened as well as a new Globo, which is a landmark bakery here since the late 1800\\'s!  When you want a break from the show or just sit and people-watch, we now have this new addition to sit on the patio right across the street.  On the opposite side there is a new OfficeMax, that is very convenient for the folks who live around the park, but also is a great place to use their ciber area with brand new computers. I thought originally it would look out of place.  But considering it remodeled a once grand home that had been left unattended for years, it has finished the circle with a popular shopping venue for computer and tech lovers, blending into the neighborhood.  And it has also prompted the nearby banks to give their facades a nice lift.  Still a great park-or landmark.

First the road is lousy, If you take a rental car there then go slow and be careful as the road has tons of pot holes and other missing pavement. The parking has gone from 7 pesos to 20 pesos. The park entry is now 20 pesos per person. Still not bad but just be ware.\\n   Down from the parking area there are several choices, go right and you have more persons and the average temperature is a little less than 105 F, acceptable but a bit of mud is mixed up with the high traffic. Go left and the average temperature is a little bit over 105F and fewer persons and cleaner. We went left. There are several trails from the parking area but all are ankle twisters, be careful. There is also a &quot;resort&quot; a few kilometers back which we did not go to but I think it is at least worth a look as it is probably better for families. I think entry is about 100 pesos per person. Also my sister in law said there was nice hiking trails but we did not have time for that.

Here, I will concentrate entirely on R\\u00edo Caliente, probably the most popular outdoor site in the entire state of Jalisco.\\n\\nThe Hot River is born deep inside a narrow canyon where it literally boils out of the walls, sputtering and steaming, a testimony to the continuing presence of magma deep beneath the surface and a reminder that what is now a forest was once the site of a colossal volcanic explosion which took place 95,000 years ago, ejecting into the air 40 cubic kilometers of ash and pumice.\\n\\nTo visit the birthplace of R\\u00edo Caliente you need high boots and a bit of derring-do, but only 360 meters west of the river\\'s birthplace, can be found more conventional pools of hot or warm water and even a natural steam sauna. These lie within the grounds of R\\u00edo Caliente Spa, which, for four decades, attracted visitors from all over the world.\\n\\n\\u201cThis was considered a place of healing long before the arrival of the Spaniards,\\u201d spa owner Caroline Durston told me. \\u201cThe water is alkaline with a pH of 8.3 and it contains traces of all kinds of mineral salts, including natural organic lithium.\\u201d\\n\\nThis spa also offered vegetarian cuisine, yoga and Tai Chi, and was immensely popular among \\u201cnorteamericanos\\u201d right up to 2003 when the U.S. government included the state of Jalisco in a negative Travel Advisory. Overnight, the spa lost almost all its clients.\\n\\n\\u201cWere your guests experiencing problems caused by Narcos?\\u201d I asked Durston.\\n\\n\\u201cNarcos? Violence? We\\'ve never had a single case,\\u201d said the spa owner, \\u201cbut still we had to close our doors, and now I\\'m forced to sell the place.\\u201d\\n\\nFortunately, only 1.6 kilometers downstream there\\'s a balneario that never heard of those Travel Advisories. Here you can soak in R\\u00edo Caliente\\'s delightful hot waters, totally forgetting all your problems. At this spot local entrepreneurs have built four small dams across the river, creating four pools, each slightly cooler than the one above. The walls of these dams are made with river rock and in my opinion are far more aesthetic than the concrete eyesores I\\'ve seen at other hot springs.\\n\\nIn the first pool I measured a temperature of 37\\u00ba C (98.6 \\u00ba F) in the morning when it\\'s shaded. During Guadalajara\\'s hot season (the month of May), the water temperature could rise to a point of discomfort in the noon-day sun. \\n\\nAccess to the pools costs 25 pesos per carload plus 10 pesos per person parking fee. Other than the parking lot, there are no facilities to be seen. Access to this area is through the town of La Primavera, located 11 kilometers west of Guadalajara, but I suggest you avoid the pools during Semana Santa (Holy Week) when thousands of people mob the area.\\n\\nFurther downriver, feeder streams enter R\\u00edo Caliente, some of them hot and some of them cold. There\\u2019s really no way to tell what you are going to get until you stick your toe in, which can make for great family fun. The further south you go, the fewer people you will find and eventually you may have a stretch of the river all to yourself.\\n\\nJust after R\\u00edo Caliente takes a sudden turn to the west, you come to the hottest feeder stream of all, which I call The Black River, as the algae growing in it are an ultra-dark green. If you follow this feeder upstream, you will come to la Cascada Esmeralda, the Emerald Cascade, eternally shrouded in great clouds of steam whose movement in the breeze is so enchanting, you might sit there watching for hours, hypnotized by the swirling vapors.\\n\\nThe first time I visited this fairytale waterfall I was dying of curiosity to continue on to the source of the Black River and, yes, I did find a trail heading upstream, through a canyon whose walls are painted white by mineral deposits from long ago. The only problem is that this trail crosses the stream four times, and to follow it, you are obliged to hop from slimy rock to slimy rock, and to creep along a horizontal bank just above the nearly boiling water, hoping and praying you will not slip and fall into the soup.\\n\\nAt last, I came to a bowl-shaped enclosure containing a delightful-looking pool of water deep enough for several people to bathe in at once. A narrow stream of water splashed into the pool from high above. It looked like the swimming hole of your dreams, but most of the water was coming from dark, slimy, steaming mini-caves on one side. Here I took the temperature, which was a whopping 70\\u00b0 C or 158\\u00b0 F, the hottest I\\u2019ve recorded anywhere in the area. This was the source of the Black River, but it looked more like the source of the River Styx leading to Hades.\\n\\nAround six kilometers from its origin, R\\u00edo Caliente cools down to a pleasant temperature of 30 to 35 degrees, depending on the ambient weather and is now called R\\u00edo Salado, the Salty River. Children, however, have nicknamed it \\u201cThe Rock-n-Roll River\\u201d because here the warm water swirls around boulders and rushes down mini-dams, creating a bubbling effect that the Jacuzzi Corporation could only envy. This part of the river can be accessed from Jalisco highway 70 and has facilities for camping. \\n\\nFifteen kilometers from its source, the river plunges down picturesque waterfalls called Los Chorros de Tala, which are well worth viewing both from above and below. The Chorros are, in fact, so lovely that many weddings take place here just so the bride and groom can have the falls in the background of their fotos de boda.\\n\\nTotally cooled off after their final dramatic plummet down the Chorros de Tala, the waters of R\\u00edo Caliente finally disappear languidly somewhere in the swamps surrounding La Vega Dam.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Forest of the Spring (Bosque de la Primavera)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/38/0d/dd/forest-of-the-spring.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "KilA3metro 20 Carretera a Tepic", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "605453700": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Amazing forest/park at 15 minutes from downtown Guadalajara", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d558552-Reviews-Forest_of_the_Spring_Bosque_de_la_Primavera-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_A.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/38/0d/dd/forest-of-the-spring.jpg", "datePublished": "August 11, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I\\'ve lived in Guadalajara for +25 years and visited it since day 1.

We went to three distilleries, all unique and smaller &quot;craft&quot; type production places. We absolutely loved it! Each hat its own flair, and of course tequila. We learned a lot and had a blast tasting 30+ different types of tequila. We felt completely safe the entire time (important in Guadalajara/Jalisco) and just had fun. Paco really made it a very memorable experience. My wife and I definately recommend this tour over the Sauza/Tequila train/Herredura Tour.

We had stops at 3 distilleries and were shown the different processes in making the tequila. My partner particularly enjoyed the fact that we were encouraged to try all the different grades of tequila and there was no limit to how much we could drink! The glasses seem small, but the tequila is strong and you can easily find yourself very tipsy if you are not careful about how many glasses you are sampling. The last stop was the town of tequila, with its quaint buildings and bars and wall-to-wall tequila.

Second level of the market sells the best amazing mexican food ever. Look out for the women wearing pink vest apron behind the counter. That is where you should eat because that is where all the mama sita cook and plate up one of the best home-cooked food for ya. We had rice with pork and tomato...so hearty so comforting (see picture). They even make hot tortilla in front of you, how good is that?! To top it up, they are free...free flow just constantly fresh made and laid out in front of you. A meal only cost us 25 peso.\\n\\n- Third floor of the market is all mens goods like t-shirts and sport shoes etc. Pretty good price i must say.\\n\\n \\n\\nIf you think my reviews have been helpful to you, please click \\'Yes\\' for \\'Was this review helpful?\\'", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Mercado Libertad", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/6e/1d/c7/mercado-libertad.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Javier Mina y Calzada Independencia", "addressLocality": "Guadalajara", "addressRegion": "Jalisco", "postalCode": "44100", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "239486372": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Sensory overload!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150798-d185117-Reviews-Mercado_Libertad-Guadalajara_Guadalajara_Metropolitan_Area.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/6e/1d/c7/mercado-libertad.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A trip to Guadalajara is not complete without a trip to the Mercado Libertad also known as  San Juan de Dios -- for which there is another listing on tripadvisor.com, but it is the same place.

Last Sunday, on our first trip to Guadalajara, we headed for the Mercado Libertad. It took us about 20 minutes to find a parking spot on the street, but parking was free.\\n\\nMercado Libertad is a sprawling marketplace with everything from CDs to leather goods, from saddles to shoes, from cookware to produce. It\\'s huge. We didn\\'t see a tenth of it, I\\'m sure. \\n\\nLet me start by saying, I am not a big shopper, but this was really fun. Vendors were quick to smile and not aggressively &quot;in your face&quot; like at other markets we\\'ve visited around the globe. A few called out as we passed by, but in a low-key way that was easy to ignore if we wanted. My daughter made several purchases with her own money (candy, toys) and the vendors she dealt with were kind to her. \\n\\nDon\\'t miss the courtyard, where all kinds of colorful birds (cockatiels, canaries, lovebirds, finches, etc) and small animals are for sale. You can also buy all sorts of interesting snacks out there, like a cup of pomegranate seeds for $10 pesos or a bag of sugar cane pieces. My daughter picked up some great Day of the Dead chatzkies from one of the toy stalls.  \\n\\nThe food court upstairs is absolutely amazing. Don\\'t even think of skipping it. Most of the eateries are Mexican, though I did see several Asian places. The proprietors here are slightly pushier than the ones downstairs, but it\\'s no big deal. As you pass by every single place, someone will pop out and either hand you a menu or start reciting all their menu items. If you can, walk around the whole food court and get an overview before committing to a place.\\n\\nWe picked Fanda Virgen because the place was packed, the server (owner?) looked kind, and a table just opened up. Great decision. Everything was super fresh, and I\\'d eat there again in a heartbeat. I had a torta ahogada (excellent, fresh, well-spiced tomato sauce). Hubs had a loncha chorizo (excellent!) and my daughter had a shrimp cocktail. Hers was good, one of the best I\\'ve had, but it took forever because they had to go buy and cook the shrimp.
