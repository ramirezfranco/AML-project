If you are a diabetic in Mexico, you know how hard it is at times to find diet pop.\\n\\nHe took us first to a place that offered milk straight from the cow. Sounds icky but was pretty darn good. They put in some chocolate powder, then cane alcohol to kill any bacteria, then milk the cow into the glass. Tasted like a chocolate milkshake. We then drove about halfway when he stopped at a small store for anyone who needed the bathroom. A small break and great for getting road snacks. He made sure to point out the &quot;sleeping woman&quot; in the mountains as we were driving there. \\n\\nOnce we arrived at el Salto, we all, including Francisco got changed into our bathing suits. A few of us played in the water park for a bit. The water is fed by the same source as the waterfall so it is clean and cool, not full of chemicals. When we were finished playing we went for the short walk to the waterfall. We were not allowed to bring glass bottles but that is understandable. There is a picnic area as well as bathrooms on the way to the falls if you are going to drive there yourselves. We walked down the stairs to the bottom and Francisco helped us across to a rocky area where we could post for pictures or play go into the water to play in the waterfall. There is a small creek the waterfall empties into that you can play in as well. This leads to a small beach. As I was the one taking pictures I didn\\'t get a chance to see the beach. You should wear water shoes as the rocks are a little slippery. I could not figure out why Francisco got changed, but he comes into the water with you to make sure you are safe.\\n\\nWhen we were done playing in the waterfall, we went back up and had a yummy lunch that was waiting for us. We had so much food we were stuffed. I said that all that was missing was a hammock and the guy who made our lunch went into the back and brought one for me to lay on. He tied it up and I was in heaven. Some people relaxed and dried off while others went back into the waterpark until it was time to leave.\\n\\nThis was a fun excursion and we didn\\'t feel rushed like some others we have been on.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "El Salto Waterfall", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/29/69/94/beauty-all-around.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Pena Colorada", "addressLocality": "Colima", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "555887987": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "1.5 Hours outside the city, small nature park", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153983-d1836114-Reviews-El_Salto_Waterfall-Colima_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/29/69/94/beauty-all-around.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This was a small nature park about 1.5 hours outside the city.

Many questions pop up: who were the people who inhabited this area? What did the place look like when it was in use? What was the purpose of the buildings? Very few answers are offered and not many of them quite convincing. I personally think the location of the buildings has to be understood in relation to the Colima vulcano but that speculation of mine was not supported by the few explanations, in spanish, english and n\\u00e1huatl, on site.

There is a hotel, a one story flat, next to the lake. I stayed there for 3 days. It was super awesome to have the complete view, the smoky volcano, jungle, lake, and the reflection of the volcano in the water right from the room window. At the sunset it looked magical, like Jurassic Park, as if the dinasours were walking around somewhere. The room was big, with bathroom, and cost only 300 peso. \\n\\nThere are also some houses/suites with kitchen, cost more but not next to the lake. Camping, BBQ, kids playground also available. On the weekends there were hundreds of locals but only a few during weekdays, and very few stay over night. Only saw one foreign couple the whole time so guess not many tourists know this place, that\\'s why I\\'m putting it on TA. You can eat some meals at the restaurant Thurs - Sun, but better to do picnic or BBQ, bring your own pot and pans. If you don\\'t have one it\\'s possible to borrow from them, but looks like they only have one or two, it\\'s their own. It\\'s better to bring your own food, but there is also a small store nearby with basic supply to make meals. \\n\\nThe staff were super nice, the widow of the room were glass stripes and 3 were missing, they replaced it right away. It\\'s much colder at night than in town, they got me extra blanket and even a electric heater, though to most people you won\\'t find it necessary at all.  When restaurant was closed they even allowed me to use the kitchen from there suite to cook. Muchas gracias a todo el personal en Laguna Carrizalillo :D\\n\\nThe bus from Colima takes about one hour drops you off right in front the gate. But the schedule is about every 2 hours so better to check before you go. There is also a small town called Comala quite nice with all white one story houses, you can stop by on your way back, the bus between there and Colima every half an hour.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Volcano of Colima", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/38/80/84/a-puff-a-day-keeps-desaster.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Colima", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "342625058": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A must in Colima!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153983-d1176207-Reviews-Volcano_of_Colima-Colima_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/38/80/84/a-puff-a-day-keeps-desaster.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The hike up to Nevado de Colima was on our to-do list in Mexico, and it lived up and exceeded our expectations.

The food was mediocre, but the hotel was a beautiful restoration.  We were fortunate enough to be there at the beginning of their Lent pre-celebrations, so there was a parade in the square, followed by the bull-fights the next day (which we were sorry to miss).  There was a lovely tourist office in the square with helpful staff.  We were able to book an afternoon tour of the area with a very friendly, knowledgeable tour operator, Florencio from Corazon de Colima Tours.  We drove toward the volcano (didn\\'t have enough time to hike to it), experienced the Zona Magica, a lagoon where coffee is grown, a coffee &quot;factory&quot; and Comala, another beautiful town with an outdoor restaurant in the central square.  Their specialty is &quot;punches&quot;-buy a drink &amp; the tapas keep coming until you tell them to stop.  For 3 drinks &amp; all we could eat, plus tip, the bill was under $10!  If we had known earlier, we would have stayed in that area for a few days, &amp; taken tours to the surrounding pueblos.\\nWe took the ETN bus back to Manzanillo-luxurious, express bus &amp; very cheap.  There is a huge difference between the local buses &amp; the city-to-city express buses.

The best way to get there is from the city of Colima (Capital of the state of Colima), from the quota carretera going south towards Manzanillo, exit at Los Osmoles and continue to Los Ortices. On the other side of this village you will see a sign on the right-hand side for Tampumacchay Hotel (double wide gate entrance is on your left). When we went we were lucky to talk to a local person walking on the road who accompanied us all the way through our visit. A previous rain storm had left the 1/2 kilometre entrance full of very deep ruts so we left our vehicle on the small village road and walked in. Our impromptu guide gave us the names and information about the trees and plants we could see along the way. We finally got to the Tampumacchay Hotel and found it locked up with no one there. We could see a locked gate further in which was for the site we had come to see. A woman watering plants at the neighbouring property where there was a huge swimming pool gave us the information that the site was CLOSED with no known date that it would reopen. She walked us over to the hotel and showed us a display window where the hotel had a great number of artifacts that came from this archeological site. I took pictures of these as proof that we had at least something for our effort. Mexico is always an adventure where we can find something amazing or tragically deteriorating from lack of funds.
