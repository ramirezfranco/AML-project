The shop itself is pretty expansive and has a lot of different products to shop for.  The prices are very good and the staff are very friendly.  If you can speak even a little Spanish, it can help you a lot.  I would recommend getting there earlier in the day, as it appeared to get very busy after 10 or 11am.\\n\\nThe mine itself is in beautiful location, and once you get to the mine, the guide will give a history of the mine, how to hunt for opals, and even do a demonstration of how the old miners worked the mine.  Again, Spanish is super helpful, since my guide didnt speak English.  After the info session, they give you a small pickax and around 30-40 min to hunt in a designated area.  I didnt find anything too fancy, but my friends managed to find some really good pieces.\\n\\nAfter the mine visit, the owner will do a demonstration in the shop to show the process of cutting and polishing opals.

The park is spacious and it is ideal place for you to plop down and read a book. It is a good place to visit if you have children. The park consists of a playground and a water canal. It is lined with trees that provide great shade for an afternoon nap. There is a snack stand available on the premises.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Parque La Pila", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0c/78/68/56/del-mismo-evento-de-autos.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av.
