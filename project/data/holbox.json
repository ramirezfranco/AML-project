Not everyone accepts plastic and the ATMs sometimes run out of cash. The best ATM is in the police station on the SE corner of the Parque Centro.

After reading all the great things about the place, we decided to check it out. Please keep in mind that this is only my opinion. I saw some tourists having a very good time. However, after spending several days at Isla Mujeres, Holbox was not that grand. First of all, I will share what I loved about the place. At night, the whole town\\'s square becomes alive with both locals and tourists. There are several good restaurant and street stands. It is safe and very family friendly. The sea breeze adds a delightful touch to it as well. One of the nuisances that I encountered though, were the large pot holes in the middle of the dirt roads, which formed huge puddles, making it difficult to cross by foot. If you tried walking along the sides, sometimes the sidewalks were covered with trash and debris from local construction, making bypassing the puddles impossible. If you decide to head out to Punta Cocos, make sure you get a golf cart. I enjoy walking long distances, but the giant puddles and the scorching sun (I went in November) made the 4 PM walk very extenuating. Finally, what I really disliked, was the fact that there was not a single place to sit on the beach and have a picnic. All of the beachfront has been taken over by restaurants and hotels. Perhaps if I had walked further, I would have found something, but after a 15 minute walk I lost hope. My advice would be that if you decide to go, stay for a day or two, but don\\'t plan your entire vacation around it. There is so much more Q. Roo has to offer to settle for this place.

A 2 hour drive (longer by bus) from Cancun airport through predominantly unpopulated land to arrive at the little port of Chiquila. Another half hour on a ferry and voila\\u2019 you\\u2019ve arrived at the end of the road, with nowhere else to go and where you are presented with endless miles of exquisite fine white sand. In a good way it felt like a very long way from the hectic pace of city life in London.\\n\\nThis is paradise. But the thing about \\u2018paradise\\u2019 is for every great view there is almost always a pile of garbage or an eyesore just around the corner. The same is true of Holbox; there are a lot of great things here but there is also the customary fly tipped rubbish, scruffy scrub, abandoned half built structures and some building sites (progress must indeed progress even in paradise!). \\n\\nSo that was first impression and I realised after a few days that the real beauty of Holbox is it\\u2019s virgin nature. There\\u2019s a lot to do in the natural world here - swimming with whale sharks, seeing dolphins, manta ray and turtles, manatee and flamingo and even crocodiles if you\\u2019re willing to brave the mangrove. There are great swathes of shallow limpid water that runs for kilometres, and you can walk in these shallows several hundred metres offshore to reach distant beaches like Punta Mosquito.\\n\\nSo, for me, that\\u2019s where the real beauty of Holbox lies. I found the little Holbox town a bit tatty and scruffy, but not in a particularly atmospheric way like other similar places I\\u2019ve visited. There are some stunningly painted shacks here and there but in between too many ugly concrete structures that lack similar atmosphere and charm. \\n\\nI think it would be wrong to come to Holbox expecting to find un untouched paradise. It\\u2019s been touched enough by human hands to not really be virgin anymore, but equally (in my opinion) not quite low developed enough to be truly charming. It\\u2019s sort of somewhere in between. \\n\\nSo if you really want a sense of the virgin island you need to get away from the town. Town is too full of tourists and electric buggies to feel like paradise, but if you head out towards Punta Coco, Punta Mosquito or beyond you can get a greater sense of peace and a greater sense of somewhere untouched. \\n\\nWe sadly hit very unsettled weather. El Norte, which brings cold sea temperatures, rain, unclear water and vast swathes of stinking sea weed. Until we arrived I\\u2019d never heard of El Norte but we discovered the season can last through December and through to January. When El Norte starts to blow it can be quite fierce, the sea is rough and beaches pretty much disappear with the sea swell. Where we stayed almost became an island with the amount of wash thrown up from the sea overnight. In summary we saw a broad spectrum of climatic conditions from total paradise serenity to strong winds with powerful waves crashing across land and turning boats and cabins over on the beach. Maybe not what we were hoping for but exciting nonetheless. \\n\\nI\\u2019ve been to many places in the Caribbean and there are a few that stick in my mind as being truly like paradise: Flamenco Beach in Culebra, Trunk Bay in St John and various tiny islands around Puerto Rico made my jaw drop. Holbox didn\\u2019t make my jaw drop and although the beaches along the main strip are nice I can\\u2019t say I found them particularly beautiful. There were a few too many ugly geotube break-waters and abandoned lumps of concrete that blight it. Even so there were two places that stuck out along the beach - these caught my attention because of how nice they looked externally, their attention to detail, their position on the beach, and the fact they made the effort to clean the seaweed away - Casa las Tortugas and La Palapa Beachfront Hotel. \\n\\nSo would I go back, the acid test? I liked it, I enjoyed it, even the banged up little town started to grow on me. I just feel so much more could be done to increase the sense of charm here. I would hate to see it overdeveloped like Cancun but equally I can\\u2019t forgive the crappy abandoned structures that blight virgin territory. Even though I didn\\u2019t fall in love with it I was sad to leave and would have happily stayed for longer. So yes I probably would return, it felt like there were more things to discover, more facets to reveal themselves and paint a picture of an island perhaps more complex than it seems at first sight.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Holbox Island", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/dc/f4/f4/photo4jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "640961403": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Overrated, overpriced, lots of trash, avoid.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g616319-d14049683-Reviews-Holbox_Island-Holbox_Island_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/dc/f4/f4/photo4jpg.jpg", "datePublished": "December 22, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The island in itself is a natural paradise, no doubt.

First, the place I rented was cheap and beautiful complete with AC and WiFi.

The sky is so clear you can stargaze and see Jupiter as well as as swim in water that is clean and pure.  To stay here you need a sense of adventure because there is lots of wildlife, insect bites, bats at night, no clear road signs and WiFi that comes and goes.  And it is 99% cash only!  Only a few places accept plastic.  Please note that the ADO bus that takes you from the Ferry at Chiquila back to the Cancun airport only has 4 departures per day so plan carefully.  And yes, there are lots of European millennials.

It doesn\\'t look like much and would be easy to miss, but what a great experience this was. We were welcomed in by Morelia, the owner, and her small staff. After a quick tour and some pictures of the resident coatis, we went to greet the dogs. Some of them weren\\'t in great condition, and that was hard for me to see, but I remembered that this was the very reason for the shelter: to rehabilitate them and nurse them back to health. \\n\\nDespite their condition, the dogs were thrilled to see us and excited for a walk and all the attention. It was great to take them out and give them some one-on-one attention. We returned after about 45 mins and took them into the feeding area, where they were given their dinner.\\n\\nSince returning from this trip, I\\'ve recommended that anyone visiting Holbox venture over to the shelter. My mom recently went and had a similarly great experience. I\\'ve also been volunteering with them to develop a new website and hopefully forge connections on the island so that more visitors will be aware of the shelter\\'s existence.\\n\\nWhile not your typical tourist stop, it\\'s really lovely to be able to see the work Morelia is doing and learn about the need for a shelter and animal education in the area.
