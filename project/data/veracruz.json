You can see the oldest port in North America which is still heavily used today, try local delicacies (such as fresh fruits, tacos, and other tasty foods), and shop in the local shops where local artisans sell their wares. \\n\\nAbout a block from the Malecon is La Gran Parroquia, the oldest cafe in North America. Still standing in its original location, this coffee shop was opened in 1808, 54 years before the famous Cafe Du Monde opened in New Orleans, Louisiana. Here, you will be served strong coffee in a glass tumbler, to which a Lechero (milkman) will add hot milk by pouring it from high up from a large tea pot. This is served with cinnamon twists which come somewhat dry, because they are meant to be dipped into the coffee. There is often live music here, and the staff are very friendly and attentive. You can purchase bags of their ground coffee for 150 pesos for a 1/2 kilogram bag (about $10CAD). \\n\\nOn the pier itself, there are a number of street vendors set up. They will call out to you (if you are Caucasian) &quot;Guera!!&quot; or &quot;Guero!!&quot; which is Spanish slang for white person - not intended to be an insult. You will also be able to see the Naval installation in the form of monuments, buildings, and the presence of Naval soldiers dressed in white uniforms. There are also boys who dive for sea shells and will sell them to you for a couple of pesos each.

Like some other cities in Mexico the malecon is a wide seaside walkway that follows along the coast. We walked from its start to just a bit past the acuario (aquarium) which was at least a one mile walk (about 2 kms). Start where the city joins the harbor across the street from the huge Gran Cafe coffee house and just keep walking. At the start you will pass a long line of tourist venders selling jewelry, T-shirts, and typical trinkets. Keep walking and you will pass the old light house (Faro) and the Pemex Tower (oil company). The sidewalk turns as you pass the Pemex Tower and just keep walking along in that same southerly direction. Soon you will be away from the center of Veracruz but just keep on walking. The sidewalk is used by many and at all times of the day. You will pass many homes, businesses, and hotels but all of them will be on the opposite side of the street so you have a nice view of the water. Soon you will no longer be along the harbor but along the Gulf of Mexico proper. Yes, the palapa restaurants pop up after a while and you can walk on the sand if you prefer. And after a mile or a bit more you will come to the large complex that houses the aquarium and more. Later that day we did visit the aquarium but first we walked past it and crossed the street and caught a local bus that went all the way to Boca del Rio which was several miles away. You will pass many beach front hotels and restaurants and shops and eventually you will reach the touristy Boca del Rio area where you will find even more hotels and restaurants, a large shopping center, and, of course, a river which explains the name of this suburb. We got off our bus at that point and caught a bus going back towards Veracruz, got off at the aquarium, and had a great couple of hours there. Of course, we could have gone shopping or had a meal in Boca too. Back to the malecon- there seemed to be people walking along in the part of it that was close to Veracruz. The closer to Veracruz and the more people who were out for a walk. Just out for a stroll, jogging, or walking their dog.

Pirates liked the port of Vera Cruz as well.  I think of the fort as being petite when I compare it to the Spanish fort in St. Augustine.  It is also petite compared to a huge drydock vessel moored close buy, cargo carriers stacked with containers 4 units high, and the surrounding city.  I went looking for holes in the wall caused by the American and French bombardments, but found none!  American Express donated $150,000 (a plaque so attests) to repair the fort.  The entrance is guarded by armed soldiers.  The site is now shared with the Mexican navy and is refereed to as arsenal #3.  A large number of patrol boats and civilian sailboats occupy the harbor.  Fort Ulua, though built of coral reef, was apparently plastered over and painted a canary yellow and red ocre.  Fully restored and painted it would shine like a jewel in the Caribbean.  The Fort is connected by a causeway now being covered with sand from the surf that actually form dunes!  There is a small museo on site.

She spoke no English and spoke Spanish too rapidly for us to follow so we talked her into not ushering us around.

There were a lot of people there with us, but not so many that we could not see what we wanted when we wanted.  We were also able to take unobstructed photos and videos of the amazing variety of sea life on display in the beautifully arranged tanks.  It would be impossible to list everything that we saw; some of the highlights included manta rays that resembled great bats as the \\u201cflew\\u201d through the water, enormous and eerie moray eels, ghostly jellyfish, sharks and barracudas, many varieties of turtles, penguins, and the obligatory performing dolphins (which made us rather sad).  As you enter the aquarium there is an area that has many brilliantly-colored toucans, macaws and parrots flying free.  There are several opportunities to have a professional photo taken during your visit.  Go ahead and have the photos taken, you get the opportunity to review them at the end of your visit and decide if you want to purchase any of them (prints only).  Despite the rather steep price of 130 pesos each, we wound buying three.

He just swam in slow circles around the top of the tank and had some white stuff growing on his tail.  Looked pretty sad.  As for the dolphins, I really hope they have some other place they keep them because that tank is like a prison cell.  \\n\\nAll in all, it\\'s worth the 100 pesos, but not much more.

We paid 300 pesos per person (about $ 16 USD, 14 Euro) for: about four hours in an inflatable raft with life vests and helmets, five passengers to a guide, and hot wrapped tamales and corn on the cob at the end, and a ride to the take-in and return to the parking. The guides also let us swim at several magic places, including a magnificent waterfall at the beginning, and those who wanted to, crossed the river on a zipline (safely and professionally aided). The rapids were really demanding and required good paddling and practice, and another boat capsized and all fell in the water, but my other two adults were experienced and prevented our boat from flipping. Sadly, some of our friends in the other boats fell on rocks, when their boat flipped. They wrote only our first names down at the beginning. (I am very happy this is not &quot;America Liability Sue You Nation!&quot;, which puts an end to all fun and just pays lawyers and drives up the price...) All of my Mexican friends took it in stride and worked on their bruises later. I was the only non-Mexican lady, (I am German) plus, my family members are not Mexican. I experienced beautiful camaraderie, team spirit, hospitality, gratitude and community. I can very highly recommend this activity to experienced white-water rafters with a sense of adventure, who will accept responsibility for themselves. Along the river, we saw many locals in the water, and cows, other wildlife, rocks, waterfalls. Another river with warmer water merged with the Rio Filolobos. We totally loved this day out in the middle of nowhere off the grid floating down a clean, clear Mexican river.

This allows to visit a rather remarkable with a main plaza with pyramidal platforms arranged in an amazingly beautiful way, and in a gorgeous Jungle setting. \\nYet there is  a nicely tended grass area between the excavated parts so one can easily appreciate the very fie geometrical setting of the main part of the site. I would say it is a very beautiful place and worth a visit for any fan or archeological sites also because the architecture is an interesting amalgamate of Tajin style and Theotihuacan influence.\\nIt is not one of the topflight sites (like theotihuacan, Tajin, Monte Alban or the top Mayan sites,\\nbut has a good place in the next lower league!\\nAnother site, Vega d lea Pe\\u00f1a which can be visited nearby after a medium hard walk.

We also saw a few mariachi bands, and lots of people just relaxing and hanging out under the spotlighted palm trees.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Plaza de Las Armas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/34/58/c2/plaza-de-veracruz.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Miguel Lerdo de Tejada", "addressLocality": "Veracruz", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "91700", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "284187206": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Amazing views", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150804-d153182-Reviews-Plaza_de_Las_Armas-Veracruz_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/34/58/c2/plaza-de-veracruz.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "There is always something going on many people passing by so if you have your camera there is a lot of possibilities, in the evening also there is music bands near by, check the schedule and enjoy", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Plaza de Las Armas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/34/58/c2/plaza-de-veracruz.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Miguel Lerdo de Tejada", "addressLocality": "Veracruz", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "91700", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "273769827": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Keep your eyes open", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150804-d153182-Reviews-Plaza_de_Las_Armas-Veracruz_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/34/58/c2/plaza-de-veracruz.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The plaza itself is average, and the bands and dancing interesting.

By size it\\'s a lot smaller than the one in Merida. But it\\'s even busier. There\\'s a bunch of stalls selling food, clothes and souvenirs. In the center it\\'s set like a small park with some trees and a bunch of benches to sit down and relax.\\n\\nThe Plaza is traffic free, so it\\'s very convenient to stroll around.

Too bad that they mostly sell similar food - the typical &quot;mexican&quot; fare for tourists. \\nBut you don\\'t have to go for the food....just grab a few drinks and enjoy some people-watching. There is always some music played somewhere, mostly Mariachi Bands. \\n\\nIt\\'s really fun - and it gets even more fun after dark. All the locals head out to the Zocalo to and enjoy their time together. On weekends it\\'s completely packed...but in a fun way. The only thing that\\'s very annoying are the street vendors (the walking ones). About every 30 seconds (no kidding!) somebody shows up trying to sell you something. Kids, grown-ups, elderly people. Some just beg for money. I understand that some rely on that income. But you really not get a break. Of course, a firm &quot;No gracias&quot; is mostly enough....but do that for 2-3 hours!

I\\'m so glad he offered this and the knowledge we gained was priceless. Lots of old photos and an explanation of how the city was formed.
