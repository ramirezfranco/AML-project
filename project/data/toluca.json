This stadium is a fabulous experience: modern, perfectly designed for f\\u00fatbol, loud, energetic, great food options, super sightlines, urban setting (you can walk from Centro Hist\\u00f3rico) and a very active scene (food, souvenirs, etc.) around the stadium. Make sure you exit on the south side (Constituyentes) and then walk down 23 de Septiembre.

The Jardin does not fit in so well with other architecture but it is still a fascinating looking building and if we return to Toluca we will definitely go inside for a thorough look. We are sorry that we missed out. \\nA week after we were there it was the spot where President Obama, President Pena Nieto of Mexico, and Prime Minister Harper of Canada met and made some announcements.
