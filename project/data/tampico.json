Tampico is not different. The Cathedral is nice. It was in renovations when I visited, so I was only able to peek inside. It is beautiful inside, but not much different from cathedrals in similar sized cities. The plaza has a large gazebo and plenty of places to sit and enjoy the Tampico heat and watch people.

When I discovered Laguna del Carpintero I was excited. It is basically a long sidewalk next to the lagoon network where you can see crocodiles sunning themselves, iguanas in the trees, and turtles in the water. Make sure to stay on the path as the crocodiles are very close and there are red ant nests. There are families out walking and lots of sweetheart couples. The downside is that there are also sad feral cat populations that are starving and most likely eating the native wildlife. Overall, if you find yourself in Tampico it is definitely a worthwhile place to visit.

Not only can you enjoy your favorite drinks, and cold beer, but you may also throw your feet up on a chair and enjoy the daily cruises throughout the Chairel lake, while enjoying the beautiful sunset, and watching the assorted wildlife in the lake.  Other boats even pull alongside, and order a drink to go.  The cruises last an hour and a half, and are well worth the 60 pesos fee.  Prices of drinks and beer are very reasonable, and the service is excellent.  We highly recommend this &quot;barquito&quot; as a relaxing place to spend the afternoon, or evening.
