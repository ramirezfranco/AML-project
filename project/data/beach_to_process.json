When we got to the beach, we stopped at the 2nd or 3rd little restaurant on the beach.", " This beach is accessible from La Ropa beach. It is a short walk (10 min) through a rocky terrain but well worth it! It is a smaller beach and the water seems much warmer than it's neighbor beach. Give it a try for a day.", "Nice beach and beach restaurants, not much to see snorkeling, very rocky.", " Travel by small boat to the beach (Playa) at Las Gatas from Zihuatanejo to enjoy a day of relaxation and beach activities. Good food available from any of the many reataurants on the beach", " Spend a couple days at the beach. Great restaurants along the beach.", " We brought our hammocks and set them up on the right side of the beach. I would recommend water shoes as the beach has lots of rocks and corals. There are plenty of restaurants along the beach and snorkling is available.", " We spent a day a this beach, which is accessible only by water taxi. We brought our hammocks and set them up on the right side of the beach.", "There are lots of restaurant at this beach.", "Love that beach lots of fun.", " Beautiful beach!! We went to the last restaurant on the beach. She used to sell things on the beach and after hard work for many years she was able to buy this restaurant.

She used to sell things on the beach and after hard work for many years she was able to buy this restaurant.", " Beach across the bay from Zihuatanejo. Only way to get there. Beach is about a dozen restaurants and covered with chairs and shade. Nowhere to put out a towel. Beach is coarse sand and broken sea shells.", "If you are in Zihuatanejo you MUST take water taxi to this beach.", " But we made our way to the end of the beach where it was less crowded and sat down for lunch. Where we were on the beach, the bottom was a little rocky; I don't know how it was on the other side.", " The beach has multiple restaurants to pick and choose from for the perfect spot to lounge. Although, the only down fall I had found was some of the beach has rocky areas. We really enjoyed this beach and will definitely return.", " What a beautiful beach.", "This beach is absolutely beautiful.", "Very clean beach, with beautiful water!!!", " This beach is just a row of restaurants.

The beach is a wonderful way to spend a relaxing day(s)", " Love this beach!!! We go to this beach several times on are visits.", "The most crowded beach I've ever been to.", " We visited Playa Las Gatas in 2010 with a 4 year old and again in 2015 with a 18 month and 9 year old. The calm, clear waters and shallow beach make it a great place to sit in the shade on the comfort of beach chairs with your feet in the waves (and cold Coronas readily available) while kids can play safely on the beach (under watchful eye of course). If you are staying on La Ropa, you can walk the short rocky trail from the south end of the beach near La Gaviota Restaurant, to Las Gatas Beach. Water taxis are available from the main pier in Zihua as well.", " The beach is relatively small (in comparison to La Ropa), it will depend on what you like to do, as to whether this beach is worth a visit. It is very much catering for tourists, with the beach lined with bars and restaurants. I imagine in high season it is full of people. You can get to the beach by boat from the Zihua pier.", " The beach itself is beautiful, mostly clear waters, calm surf, greenery surrounding, white sand(ish) but it was crowded with vendors that make it so you have to buy a drink at least at some establishment to use the beach chairs that are pretty much right up to the surf, so the beach itself feels crowded. that you pass by, and it gets old, you can't even walk across the beach without trying to not be rude and brush off vendors when you first arrive.", " The beach did get crowded after a while, so we took our leave, but it was a great experience!", " We met Marcos on the Intrawest beach and to my surprise my dear wife agreed to go fishing. When you go, and everybody does pick one of the first restaurants, the food and service is the same all down the beach, but the beach is better.", " A small and sometimes packed beach. The sandy area can be quite tight along certain parts of the beach but if you wander over it is a nice relaxing beach to check out. Even though there are roads up the hill at the back of the beach, they say that you can only get there by boat or by walking across the rocks from Playa la Ropa (recommended). There is also some basic accommodation offered at the beach which we would have liked to check out as it would have been a real chillout to stay there.", " Add to that the many restaurants along the beach. Its a great day away from it all", " Playa Ropa is a great 2 mile beach near Zihutenejo. You can walk or cab there from town  if you are not staying at a hotel on the beach. There are several hotels on the beach or within walking distance. The beach is located in a bay so it is nice for swimming. Lots of families frequent the beach.", " Enjoyed relaxing on the beach after our meal at Ottila's.", " If you're looking for a beach with a lot of beach restaurants with a lot of small restaurants, this is the place to go around Zihua.

The beach was very crowded and not much space to walk between restaurants and the water until you get to the farther side of the beach.", "This beach is amazing.", " And go early because the beach closes around 4. The sand was white and the water was a beautiful clear blue. I recommend going all the way to the end of the beach, there are alot less people. We felt like we had the beach to ourselves.", " We paid $50 for a cab ride, breakfast and a trip to Playa Las Gatas. We never made it to the beach. Apparently the beach is pretty nice.", " The beach is protected for the latter but we did not stay because most of the beach is crowded by chairs in front of restaurants manned by extremely aggressive vendors. If you are part of a spring break trip and looking for a place on the beach with cheaper booze this may your thing. The beach itself is beautiful but it is not worth the hassle when you have Playa la Ropa so close and it is certainly not worth a $20 water taxi ride.", " The boat ride over to Las Gatas is fun, but the beach itself is pretty disappointing. The beach furniture is not so great, and the beach is rocky - so don't go in the water without shoes!", " At the beach you rent a chair for the day. The farther down the beach the better and cheaper.", "This beach is simply beautiful.", "Short beach with lots of restaurants.", " I think that if you are in Zihuatenajo, you should check out this beach for yourself. Some people absolutely love it while others like ourselves feel it is just okay. It is a small white sand beach that you either walk along the shoreline from La Playa Beach or take a boat taxi from the marina in Zihuat to get to. It was slow when we were there so every single restaurant had their 'sales person&quot; out front giving you their pitch to eat and drink at their place. The chairs are on a slant, so I didn't find that so comfortable. We also walked over from La Ropa beach one day to check it out and didn't stay. In the three weeks that we were in Zihaut, we only came to this beach twice. The rest of the time we stayed at La Ropa which we loved.", " I think that if you are in Zihuatenajo, you should check out this beach for yourself. It is a small white sand beach that you either walk along the shoreline from La Playa Beach or take a boat taxi from the marina in Zihuat to get to.

It is a friendly hard sell but it makes for a long walk on a short beach.", " We went to Playa Las Gatos because we heard there would be good snorkeling and a nice beach. First from the guy who grabs your arm to &quot;help&quot; you off the boat then from a waiter from each of the restaurants that line the beach. As someone else suggested here just mention the name of another restaurant down the beach and they will ease up a bit. We ended up at Otilias towards the end of the beach. All told 5 beers, 3 tacos, 1 kebab and some chips and guacamole ran $450 pesos plus tip. If you want to do that go to the far end of the beach. You will have plenty of opportunity to buy silver jewelry, beaded bracelets, banana boat rides, massages, hair braiding or to hire a band as these will be offered to you every few minutes by vendors working the beach.", " We ended up at Otilias towards the end of the beach. If you want to do that go to the far end of the beach.", " The far end of the beach was rocky which was okay with us since we were there for the snorkeling which was best at this end of beach. The beach is lined with lounge chairs associated with the small restaurants.", " You can walk south down the beach. There are a number of wonderful restaurants along the beach. However, you won't be disappointed in any of the other ones. Carlos' SCUBA is located on this beach. I recommend this beach as a day trip.", " We took a horse back riding tour on this beach. It was a huge, wide beach that stretches as far as you can see and we were the only people on it. Apparently the weekends are busier. It was a gorgeous, golden beach.", " We took a horse back riding tour on this beach. It was a huge, wide beach that stretches as far as you can see and we were the only people on it.", " Not only was the weather perfect, the beach was secluded and quiet and no hassle from vendors! There's only a few restaurants on the beach and there are miles of sandy beach. There are also little deep pockets right at the shore so you can sit in the clear warm water and enjoy your mini &quot;wave pool.&quot; Definitely no swimming at this beach bc of the waves but we had tons of fun playing in the water and letting the surf push and pull you along. Lastly, we took a can from zihua and it cost us 100 pesos, and since we sat for the sunset on the beach we caught a passenger truck (across from the convenient store) down the road we came in on to the freeway, then caught a combi bus to el Centro.", " I walked down the beach and didn't see a soul for miles. I definitely will be returning to that beach next year!", " We first went to Barra de Potosi there are several beach restaurants it has a lagoon and boat tours the food and beer is real inexpensive and very good it seems the wide beach is gone since the last storm. It is allot farther then Playa Larga we then stopped at playa Larga it is very wide beach but pretty desolate there are a few beach bar restaurants and 1 hotel that we saw", "Beautiful beach.", " It is very nice and you will be alone on the beach, you really have 2 hour of walking on the beach.", " Fortunately I found out you could walk into town and catch a small mini bus every few minutes that would drop you off at the road that goes down to the beach. From there you can take a short ride in the back of a small truck with bench seat to the beach. The beach itself has some of the nicest waves that curl in at 6 or 7 feet in an almost perfect crest. If you go for a walk good luck trying to get from one side of the beach to the other its a huge area to cover! A few good places to eat on the beach but far less amenities than the beaches inside the bay.", "Beautiful beach, great walking and just an all around wonderful place to take the family for a day trip.", "This is a good beach to go if you want to be alone.", " You can wander forever on this beautiful beach. Scattered along the beach are a few great seafood restaurants.", "By far the best beach I have ever been on .", "17km of deserted beach!", "Great beach to walk for miles along with Barra de Potsie Beach  which is about 5 miles of beautiful beach walking and great body surfing fun.", " You could sit at the bar near the beach or at a table on the beach. You even have beach beds if you want to have a little fiesta.", "Great beach to relax and get away.", " It is a great beach that has no people on it is still a virgin beach. it is clean and has a lot of hidden beauty. you will love it and the sun set that is always breath taking.", " This is a nice walk to and from our hotel to town. It is along the beach and we always feel safe using it.", " Great way to see the whole beach, there are restaurants available, on this end, and the massage tables are on this end, right on the beach.", " We went in late June which is low season and stayed at a hotel right on the beach. The beach is clean enough and great for bodysurfing. The beach is small and might become unbearably crowded in high season. Conclusions, a great beach to visit to relax in lounge chairs and eat well - do not fall for the idea that the further from town, the better the beach that our impression from reviews was before actually visiting Zihuatanejo.", " La Ropa gets all the reviews and little is said about Madera beach. We found this beach to be the nicest beach in the bay.", " M. J.&amp; Richies on Madera Beach has a wonderful staff, excellent food, comfortable lounges under real palapas on the most peaceful beach in Zihuatanejo. While a small beach of about 400 yards it is the best for children due to the long slope of the beach with no severe drop off. It is also very popular with the local youths often playing soccer on the beach.", "A great beach with a very local flavor.", " Having a beach in what amounts to the downtown area is certainly not a bad thing, but this isn't really a recreational beach. Thesmaller boats for local fishing fleet are pulled up on the sand here, the fish market is on the beach, and there are beachfront restaurants using part of the beach as seating area, which is really the best way to enjoy this beach.", " We had very nice snorkeling by ourselves on this rocky beach.

The water was clear and the beach was sandy.", "Great beach.", " Love this beach for how small and quiet it is. Would recommend coming to this beach to get away from the tourist action in main beaches of Sayulita where you constantly have vendors stopping by with things to sell you. There is still a little of that happening at this beach but nothing in comparison to the others.", " This is a great beach and just a short walk from anywhere in Sayulita. The surf is heavy most of the time in Sayulita so be careful of the waves and undertow. This isn't a large beach so go early if you want a nice spot.

Most people on the beach were lying in the sun or splashing in the waves. I guess this beach is better for swimming than surfing.", " Cute little beach just a 5-7 minute walk from the main Sayulita beach. Much quieter- great for swimming- but not for surfing. We came here as we had heard about the water quality issues on the main beach (especially now during the rainy season when the rains wash the towns sewage from the river into the middle of the main beach) and didn't want to jeopardize our time with Montezuma's revenge.", "A nice quiet and small beach away from the crowded Sayulita Beach.", " The beach is a good 10 minute walk from Sayulita beach and you walk by the Cemetary.

We were looking to snorkel and took gear and this beach was great.", " We preferred to spend our beach time here, rather than at Sayulita. Los Muertos is a lot quieter.

Not as crowded as the main beach in town and it is wonderful.", " If you're staying in Sayulita and have experienced the hustle and bustle of Sayulita Beach, then Playa de los Muertos is the perfect beach to read and nap for hours. There's a public road that will take you past some of the oceanside resorts and rentals before you reach a hill. Pros: \n\n- Quieter beach \n- Fewer tourists and families here. They typically don't stay for the entire day as they would on Sayulita Beach, especially on the weekends and holidays. -Bathrooms for use steps beyond the beach (10 pesos per visit). Cons: \n\n- Playa de los Muertos' shoreline is a fraction of Sayulita Beach's shoreline. It's bookended by rocks with a resort to the south.", " We weren\u2019t sure about making the trek to the beach, but it is really a short walk (10 minutes) from the main beach at Sayulita.

My favorite was the massage I had in a tent right on the beach.", " We loved this beach. It is clean and the water was warm when we were there.", " I would not recommend the part of the beach right where the village is as it is by far not as nice as walking beyond the river up north, literally 5 -10 mins walk on the beach heading north. There you will find far fewer people on the beach, it is very clean and better to play where the waves break as there are hardly any surfers there. The waves can be a bit too strong sometimes to go in with 4 year old but one can still play with the kids a bit further up the beach. It is a beautiful walk on the beach towards the north. The only reason why I don't give the beach an excellent review is because of the section right where the core of the village is as this one deserves rather a 3 star.", "The beach was gorgeous.", "Excellent beach with close proximity to the water and beach chairs, was perfect for our family outing and sitting with 10 friends.....", " We had an enjoyable day at the beach.

Maybe not ideal for anyone with a push chair, wheelchair or elderly person as you have do go down quite a few flights of stairs in order to get down to the beach.

There are several options for surf boards and bogie boards on the beach,  you might want to comparison shop. Another great benefit of this beach, is that when it gets real hot in Cabo, it is about 10-15 degree F, cooler on this beach. It makes it real comfortable in the heat of the summer.

When looking from the beach out to the ocean, we preferred the snorkeling on the left side of the bay.", " We had everything included, but if you travel here on your own, I've heard that it's very affordable and a nice way to spend a day at the beach. A few people selling things came to us on the beach but a simple &quot;no&quot; was good enough.", " We took a cab from our resort to visit the beach for the day.

It was a fun stop on our tour and I think it would be a place to return for a beach day next time", " Umbrellas and beach loungers on request at La Costeno restaurant at the far (to the right as you face the water) end of the beach. It's 66 pesos for a cab from Crucecita, and that is the best way to get there. Don't bother prebooking a cab for the return, as I have found that to be less reliable than just showing up and taking the next one, and there are LOTS to be had. There is virtually NO parking at the beach access, and you have to walk down about 100 stairs to get to the beach level.", " We really enjoy going to this beach as there is a lot of activity to watch.

So I can tell you I was shocked as I walked through the restaurants to the beach to find that the waves were 10-12 feet high and thundering onto the beach.

This beach has none of this, so ideal for people looking for peace and quiet, who have their own beach gear.", "Another beautiful beach to relax at.", " The beach itself is the only beach in the Huatulco area with surf. The beach is at the bottom of bluffs that are topped by jungle containing a huge variety of birds, reptiles and butterflies, AND the Copalita ruins. The beach stretches to your left (east) about a mile..   a short distance down the beach is where the Copalita river dumps into the ocean. Its a good place to fish for Robalo (snook).

Beautiful for a beach walk, or even better, bring your beach umbrella, and a couple chairs, and a cooler and spend the afternoon.", " The river meanders along the beach and repositions sand.

This is a walking beach and very much worth a visit.", " We made a short visit to this beautiful beach to enjoy, of all things, a mud bath from a local lady.

You would drive right by the road that takes you down the cobblestone road to this beach.

We walked the beach, enjoyed the scenary but then got bored and hopped the next taxi that came.", " We took a cab from Tangalunda for about 60 pesos, and found a wonderful natural beach to wander down with driftwoods and cliffs as a back drop. I also think you can arrange to have a mud bath at the river from the restaurant on the north of the entry road at the beach.

There is a school you will walk by near the beach.", " We always make sure we go to Bocana Beach when we are in Huatulco.", " The beach is beautiful, but had a lot of damage in a storm that hit the coast in 2013. So, I'm posting some pictures of the beach before and after the storm for anyone who's interested, The beach has increased in size tremendously...it used to be a short walk from the ocean to the road. The wall that separates the beach from the road is badly damaged and there is a small lake between the wall and the ocean. Trees washed down the river and now are strewn on the beach. The beach looks very different, but the ladies who do the Zapotecas mud baths are still there. Surfers are still on the beach.", "Great beach.", " The beach is very pretty, with the rocks all around it is beautiful.

My son loved the rocks to the right of the beach, and got to check out some sea urchins as he explored that area. I only saw one person smoking on the beach... which was annoying, but whatever.", " The public parking lot is a good size and well marked, as it butts up to a resort. There are no palpas on the beach, so if you want shade- bring your own umbrella! There are no vendors on the beach, providing a calm and quiet day! But be aware- there are plenty of seagulls also waiting on the beach for whatever snack you\u2019re willing to offer up! The best part was, what seemed to be, an old pelican that just hung out on the beach... sleeping and very comfortable with photo ops! My son loved the rocks to the right of the beach, and got to check out some sea urchins as he explored that area. I only saw one person smoking on the beach... which was annoying, but whatever.

The \u201clifeguard\u201d claimed it as his beach and had a very machismo attitude about \u201chis\u201d beach and what we were allowed and not allowed to do. We left to Medano beach and had a fabulous afternoon in the waves there.", " My wife and our two kids visited this beach. Very clean bathrooms and showers to rinse off after being on the beach.

I saw just as many colorful fish standing in the water. It is a swimmable beach with a nice restroom. There is a very new boardwalk that takes you down to the beach.

When the fellow at the information booth at the beach saw my dad was elderly and uses a cane, he offered us a free sun umbrella on one of the numerous wooden platforms connected to the boardwalk that are restricted for &quot;handicap&quot; use. The snorkelling was excellent - cloudy water close to the beach the day we were there, but by swimming a little ways around the point to the right of the beach we were able to see about 12-15 varieties of fish, as well as live coral and sea urchins. I can't recommend this beach enough.", " If you are in Cabo you really need to pend a day at this beach.", " Take a bus and ask to be let off at Chileno beach.

We were very excited to go to this beach on our last day and took a private transport there (highly recommend Eicker, they are the best!) We were at the beach by 8:20 in the morning on a Friday and we were the first there. Our driver helped us carry a cooler they loaned us down to the beach (the boardwalk is closed for repairs due to hurricane damage but you can still get to the beach through the middle). He suggested we go over to the rocks on the right side to be in the shade. Plus, many boats move into the beach at 10:30. We called Eicker and our driver was there in 20 minutes to pick us up before our scheduled 12:30 departure time (Rene is an excellent driver and very friendly).", " We snorkeled at this beach as part of a snorkel trip.

It is also swimmable which is also a plus. On the downside is that it does not have restaurants or beach front businesses which means everyone arrives with their beach chairs, ice chests and beach umbrellas.", " Chileno Beach had softer sand than the rocky beach where we stayed. It's a public beach with lifeguards, outdoor showers, parking and restrooms, but no shade, food or drink so bring your own drinks, at a minimum.

But we were glad we spent a day on this beautiful beach.", "This beach is wonderful.", " We thought we were in the wrong place as we parked in the huge paved lot that was just completed for the new condo complex next to this beach. This beach is well maintained. When we were there on a friday morning the surf was a bit higher than normal for this beach. Only the more accomplished snorkelers in our group went out, but there were 4-5 lifeguards on shore watching the snorkelers very closely from the beach - which we really appreciated! Definitely best to go in the morning when the beach is usually calmer and the water is clearer. This is a new road leading to the beach. Google maps will have you pass the beach, turn around, and lead you down a dead end.", " There are now condo's being built with no access to the area of beach over the rocks. Lots of construction going on in the parking lot and building a walkway down to the beach. I walked the length of the beach and near the middle the sand became very soft but only for a short distance then became more pebble like again.

Chileno Bay (and Beach) is absolutely gorgeous!", "Beautiful and not crowded beach.", " Chileno beach is an easy bus ride from San Jose Del Cabo. The bus driver drops you off near the highway and it's a short walk down to the beach. The beach is fantastic and the snorkelling is incredible.", " tell the driver where you're going and they will drop you off at the highway exit which is a short walk to the beach. Security is not a problem because the beach is well attended in the day time and there are houses/condos close by. if you don't snorkel then the hotel beach is just as good and therefore you don't need to bother. already there are condos along the sides of the beach so it is no longer isolated. in two years time chileno beach will no longer be special but just another beach commandeered by condo owners who will treat it like a private beach.", " in two years time chileno beach will no longer be special but just another beach commandeered by condo owners who will treat it like a private beach. all beaches in mexico are federal public property open to everyone....but in practice, beach front condo owners discourage visitors.", " Beautiful beach with lots of space for you to enjoy this very family friendly beach.", "This is the place to go if you want the perfect beach!", " If you are looking for a place to enjoy the warm water with a great beach and unlike much of the Cabo area, a shallow incline without the strong waves and under tows, Chileno beach is the place to do it.

Our family of 4 took a taxi, which was quite pricey, as the locals consider this beach &quot;a long way to go&quot; from town.", " Found this beach on Trip Advisor and would highly recommend going here for the day with your family. It is a free public beach and had the best free snorkeling we have ever seen!", " This beach was recommended as a must visit if you're going to be in the cabo area. It was blah. Easy free parking just off the highway and right next to the beach but overall not much going on.

I know I saw Dori and Nemo while snorkeling. This was a really nice beach.", " This beach is hidden, about five miles out of Cabo, and can be hard to find. There are usually boats anchored in front of the beach, but they are outside a defined swimming area. There are a series of outhouses next to the beach by the parking, and although the beach is popular I've never seen it packed with people.", " This beach was a hidden gem. Since there was no shade available on anywhere on the beach, we used to have to get here really early in order to secure a Palapa for shade. Additionally, there is a lot of construction in the surrounding area, which makes me think this public beach will be public no more. Still enjoyed our time at the beach, but had to cut it short due to the lack of shade.", "Beautiful beach used by the locals.", "Beautiful beach.", " In this part of Mexico, the sea is usually so raging the beach is not swimmable and coral is hard to find, but a short drive down the tourist corridor will find you at Chileno Beach where the beach is layered with coral, sea glass, and small shells, and you can see the coral in the sea (yachts stop here to drop off people to snorkel). Crabs, snails, and mollusks can be found among the rocks to either side of the beach. The beach is somewhat small (maybe a football field?) I've seen some people say this beach had public bathrooms, but I did not see any and have reason to believe they were torn down for construction of the resort. The beach was down several dirt roads that you don't want to attempt in the rain (not that it rains much). The beach is lovely but if you turn around, you see the walls of construction and construction vehicles. The beach is crushed coral and is like sharp gravel on your feet.", " We visited this beach on a week day because we heard it can get pretty busy. It is pristine, the snorkeling is great and the beach itself is spotless. If you walk to the ends of the beach, by the rocks it is less crowded.", "Try and take a car to this beach.", " We were told by the driver that took us into town that this was a nice beach.", " Don't get me wrong, it is still a nice beach but with all the construction going on it is dirty and dust, both the water and beach.", "Resort beach is great but Chileno Beach makes you feel like one of the locals.", " This used to be a really terrific beach--went here every year with kids and grandkids to snorkel right off the beach. A bathroom on the beach, and little palapas for shade.", " Access to the beach is well marked from the main highway. Access to the beach is a short walk from the parking lot.

Go to the next beach down, Santa Maria for a less crowded experience.", "this was a good beach to visit.", " The beach has free parking and wasn't too busy on our visits so we enjoyed it a great deal. The sand in Cabo isn't great, lots of rocks on all the beaches, so bring flip flops or beach shoes for walking to the area of the beach when you want to settle in.

Apparently he can't go down to the beach...we rented on and it worked well.", " A group of friends went to the beach for fun and sun.

They are building a condo building near by so this beach will probably change in the future but it was great now.", " This beach is in between San Jose del Cano and Cabo San Lucas. It is right off the highway where when you get off of it, a short dirt ramp takes you to the beach. I went to the beach mainly to snorkel but did end up hanging out there for a bit and while busy, it was not too busy. The beach has life guards and so was nice to have that in the back of your head especially if you are going snorkeling solo like I did. When you go to the beach make sure you only have the stuff you need especially if there is no one to watch it. There are portable toilets between the beach and the parking lot.", " Went to both Santa Maria beach and Chilena beach. By far Chilena beach has the best snorkeling.", " Went to both Santa Maria beach and Chilena beach. The beach is very clean.", " If you want a safe beach, this is it.

A bit of a drive (40 minutes) but combine a beach trip with a visit to Todos Santos and it makes for a great day.

It was very close to the resort we were staying at, so it was a nice close day trip for us", " Love this beach. This is where to go for a great beach day and to do some snorkeling. This is where all the tour boats take their tours. They are building two resorts near this beach.", " There is major construction going on around the beach entrance but you can still access the beach. There are no amenities at this beach and you drive a short distance on a dirt road to get there.

Will definitely go back to this beach on the next trip to Cabo in February.", " Arrive early to beat the crowds as locals love this beach and so do the snorkel tour boats from Cabo.

I hear this beach is super crowded on the weekends so go during the week if you can.", " Beautiful beach! No boats are allowed on this beach.", " We only spent a little amount of time on this beach today and plan on returning.

But the water is clear and we plan on doing an excursion next time to this beach for snorkeling.", " We went to this beach 2 times. The first day was one of the few days per year that the little teeny jellyfish attack the beach in droves. The beach is a short drive from Cabo.

First of all, it is a large wide beach and, unlike most beaches in Cabo, you can swim at this beach.", " There was easy parking, though it was a bit of a walk down to the beach. We chose to walk further down the beach to be away from the crowd near the most sheltered part of the water - there were lots of small children there. We brought a cooler and beach chairs and read books on the beach. This beach is easy to find, and easy to access, though I am not sure for how much longer. There is a huge resort being built right next to the parking area and it appears that it will cut off access to the beach or make it significantly more crowded. An easy drive, well marked on the highway and a very easy on and off.", "Chileno Beach is a a great beach to snorkle.", " I've only visited this beach twice, once on foot, and once on a snorkeling tour.

The beach was very clean and safe.", "The only beach you could swim.", " Be sure to check the beach status before you go. Chileno Beach is great when it's red flagged.

When you can go swimming, the beach is swarming with people... think Waikiki busy.", " It was about a 20 minute ride to the beach. The beach was pretty much empty.

But the water was so cold and we did not feel comfortable swimming too far. Next time I will choose smaller boat for our family only, because I saw those getting closer to the Arch. And I also want to ask to spent a little longer time.", " The live beach was overrated. We didn\u2019t even get off there as it was packed with people. You can ask the guide to drop you on the beach (near all the resorts) on the way back.

To come back you can do the hike or take a taxi boat. They must charge only 100 pesos for the trip to the beach and come back.", " It's a cute, small beach but I wouldn't say it's has to be a priority. It's still a nice beach but not a must see.", " Paid a little extra for the water taxi, was at the very end of the day there were only two other people on the beach was amazing was a little concerned the taxi wouldn\u2019t come back but he did.. during the day there can be allot of people on the beach so I can see the reason not to go but if it\u2019s not busy for a secluded swim and beautiful private beach second time in Cabo first time to lovers beach", " This beach is quiet and many people do snorkeling here.

The other part of the beach at Lover's Beach is where the water taxis drop you off. The waves are crashing down as the boat comes in. A few people are able to scurry onto the beach at a time before the boat has to re-position due to the waves. It's almost like you don't have a choice getting off the boat without their help! The little Lover's Beach opens up on the backside and turns into Divorce Beach. We didn't spend any time on Lover's Beach cause of it's size but Divorce Beach was plenty big. For snorkling I'd have a taxi drop me off at Pelican Rock for an hour or two.

Had the entire beach to my self!", " We did get to see the beach and it still looked beautiful.", " Such a cool place to check out, especially if you do it snorkeling. We brought some snacks and beers and spent several hours enjoying the beach. We walked over to see the Pacific and watch the waves crashing on the beach.

They told us that it's a good swimming beach, they tell you not to swim on the Pacific Ocean side, only on the Sea of Cortez side, but the waters are rough on both sides and not so swimmable, even for an experienced swimmer. With that said, it was a very pleasant stay at the beach, but I would not spend the whole day there.", " This beach is least busy in the morning.

It was cool to see.", " This small beach area near the arch is accessible by boat and everyone should check it out once.

It is not as private as it once was, nor is the beach as big as it once was thanks to last years hurricane. The drop off at the beach is an adventure in itself! the boat rides the waves up, the helpers on the beach grab your things to try and keep them dry, and then you jump into the water and they help you to shore. Once you settle in, walking the area is beautiful. Once you are done observing, if the Sea of Cortez is cooperating, swimming at Lover's beach is fun! If you are wanting to snorkel, I recommend Pelican Cove, its just a water taxi ride just before Lover's beach!", " The beach itself is very small. We were told by locals that the last hurricane they had destroyed a lot of the beach.", " You can snorkel from the beach and see people scuba diving just a short distance off the beach.

Back to the beach. It is a beautiful beach with some great rock formations. You can venture to the other side of the beach to see &quot;Divorce Beach.&quot; It is much rougher and don't even think about getting into the water! We spent about 2 hours on the beach, which we found to be plenty of time to see everthing and experience what the beach has to offer. There is not much shade and really no amenities on this beach except for a couple of locals that will sell water, soda or beer for 50 Pesos. We spent some time swimming on the Sea of Cortes side of the beach and the water was great.", "Lovers Beach is on the the best places to go.", " This beach is a must when in Cabo. Yes some of the complaints on the  other reviews are true but, it is a popular and tiny beach. Twenty people make this beach CROWDED. That is how small it is. It is located on the iconic rock formations that make el Arco. It is absolutely breathtaking. So if you are going to this beach for all of those things, then it's not the place for you. They will set up a pick up time and come back for you.", "   Playa del Amor as it is affectionately called is a small beach set on the Bay of Cabo San Lucas across from Medano Beach. The beach is fairly calm , one of the few places you can actually enter the water in Cabo. The beach is accessible by water taxi from Medano Beach ( make sure to get a price and haggle) I prefer to hike in from the property South West of downtown , Solmar , Playa Grande etc. Walk the beach East away from the properties and towards downtown , there is a small climb over some rocks and you find yourself on the Pacific side (Divorce Beach) and you will have a backdoor entrance to Lovers Beach. Amazing views at daybreak or sundown.", "Fun day, a little too crowded, beautiful water and beach is great.", " Beautiful beach and excellent views. You will most likely only spend an hour or two at Lover's Beach but it is a nice change from the resort beach. Keep in mind that you will most likely need to swim or wade to the beach from the boat.

You can get to it by walking along the beach close to Cabo Marina, but depending on the tide, it's difficult to walk around the rocks that conceal this special beach. NOTE: No toilet facilities on this beach.", " Take a water taxi out to the beach and you can spend part of the day on the beach and also walk across to the Pacific side.", " Easy to swim to the rock from the beach.

WHile it can get crowded on the lovers beach side, just a few steps away is the Pacific side with plenty of space to be along.", " We enjoyed lovers beach so much we spent 2 afternoons here! Our favorite beach in Cabo. We took a water taxi for $10/person. There are people at the beach who will assist you in getting out of the boat, which was great since we brought our 1 year old. We walked over to Divorce beach on the other side which is very beautiful and quiet, just not swimmable. We really enjoyed our time on both beaches!", " Lover's Beach is beautiful with the striking stone archway and gorgeous water. The beach area is fairly good sized and allows for swimming, and the water visibility is also good. The beach can be fairly crowded as locals bring glass-bottom boats full of people to and from the beach at fairly regular intervals. Tip: walk down the beach a little ways before agreeing to a price - we were able to whittle down the cost of a boat ride by more than half simply by walking a bit further.", " This is a nice beach area if you can get over to it.", " The water taxis wouldn't drop people on beach. It was great, we were the only people on the beach. So you can still experience the beach if your a decent swimmer.", " From the resort we were the first tourists on the beach and it was amazing. We wondered over to Divorce beach to just take in the sight of massive waves coming 40-50 yards in on the beach. There are men on the beach with phones who can call the taxi guy to let you know when the boat you came out in will be back to take you back again or they will get you one of their boats for you. There are no refreshments or food offered on the beach , so if you want to have beverages or snacks do so before you leave. On tour we were on the beach for 2 hours (1pm-3pm). After that we went to &quot;The Sand Bar&quot; great place to enjoy a cold Sol cervesa , Its a little quieter than the &quot;Mango Deck&quot; next door which is where we went the first time we went to the beach. All in all a spectacular sight on both sides of the beach.", " The surf at Lover's Beach is rough enough as you approach the beach that the boat drivers won't land.

Visit this beach, but do not use Victor's El TATA boat!", " We found out that most of the beaches in this area are not very swim friendly due to the currents so we decided to take a water taxi to Lovers beach. The beach was over crowded which is not a shock considering it is the only beach in that area you could possibly swim in. We spent two hours on the beach and that was plenty enough for me. There are umbrellas on the beach to rent - but its usually around $20 - but they will haggle\n3. there is really only about 15 feet of water that is potentially swimmable and then there is a huge drop. Bring water shoes - the sand it quite rough and your feet will hurt by the end of the day (speaking from experience)\n7.", " It's nice to have fewer people on the beach especially for taking photos. Going to this beach is a must on any trip to Cabo.", " I was able to see this famous beach from the boat I was on, but didn't set foot on it. Beautiful beach, and views to look at.

When you reach the rocks at the very end of the beach, switch to your shoes and climb over the two sets of rocks and you can get to lovers beach, which is truly amazing (pacific on one side, sea of Cortez on the other).", " I love this beach because it is secluded and never busy. There have been times its only been me and my dog there. Most of the time, the ocean is too rough to swim but what I love about this beach are the rock formations and tide pools.

The beach in front of the Rosarito Beach Hotel is very wide, and at times I've found perfect sand dollars and scallop shells. So is the noise from Papas and Beer. My favorite thing about Rosarito Beach was the Chinese balloon launch on the weekend of the Fourth of July. The displays put on by the Rosarito Beach Hotel are pretty, but the loud bomb type (m-80s, etc) firecrackers drive my dog crazy, and the summer renters set them off every weekend. The mosquitoes just south of the Rosarito Beach Hotel are much too plentiful, but I suspect the proximity to a water treatment area is the culprit.

We stayed at the Tesoro which stands on this beach and that is truly one of the hallmarks of the resort.

Apart from a sailboard competition that filled the beach and was held the last day we were there, the beach was not very crowded.", " This beach is located in a small bay with a &quot;postcard&quot; setting.
