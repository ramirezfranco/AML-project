Recently criticized in the press for the surface being &quot;dirty&quot; I became defensive.  Being partially open to the sky the cenote has to be shared by many other plants and animals - including swallows, bats, pigeons, orioles, dragonflies, fish, butterflies, turtles, buds, leaves, seedpods from a variety of surrounding tropical trees.  The last couple of years municipal employees have done a marvelous job cleaning the surface, often daily.  Of course, it doesn\\'t take long before the surface is viewed as &quot;dirty&quot; by some visitors.  As I swim I often do a little &quot;skimming&quot; with my breaststroke.  I have never had any skin ailments and, in fact, feel that the water quality is beneficial to my skin.  It is time for the lovers of this natural wonder to band together, to request reliable water quality analysis, and to work toward the positive image that the Cenote Zaci deserves.

The guide helped to take some photos in the cenote. Although it was pretty unnecessary, you could just skip the guide bit as they just want some money. I just tipped 20 pesos in the end. The cenote had about 6-7 people at the time which was perfect as my girlfriend and I can pretty much spend our time there. The water was definitely cold! It was crystal clear that you could easily snorkel inside. I didn\\u2019t bring my goggles with me which was a missed. Would recommend you to bring one or you could hire a snorkel goggles for 30 pesos for two. We swam a bit in the cenote - it was definitely a great one as we saw catfish swimming around. After the swim I sat by the entrance where we can do some fish spa where the cat fishes will come to your legs and eat all the dead skins.

We arrived here before 2PM on Aug 8, just as the rain started. Our YucaTreks guide took care of the tickets, pointed us to the change rooms, waited for us near the cave entrance, then led us down the slippery steps to the cave. Watch your step and do hold on to the rope railing. Inside the cave, sunshine streaming in from the hole above towards the waters below was such a cool sight. This cenote actually reminded my husband and I of a similar tourist attraction in Bohol, Philippines, called Hinagdanan Cave. \\n\\nI would recommend wearing water shoes because the ground you walk on and the rocks that lead down to the water are both slippery and rough\\u2014they hurt your feet. Be careful getting in and out of the water, no handholds after the first couple of steps, and it is not always easy to keep your balance. In case you were wondering--the water was so cold!\\n\\nThere are 3 different stairways leading down to the water and we chose the middle one. After stepping off the huge submerged rock, the water was immediately deep and we cannot reach the bottom. We just treaded water and kept within reach of the rope. It started to rain harder as we were swimming--we could tell from the rain falling down from the hole above. I would also recommend borrowing a life vest, even when you know how to swim, to be able to swim confidently towards the spot directly underneath the hole. We admired stalactites and overhanging vines while small fish swam around us. There was a lifeguard on duty who blew his whistle when anyone tried to grab the overhanging vines or roots.\\n\\nHeavy rainfall just as we were leaving the cave an hour later.

The exterior seems a bit depressing.  Like maybe it was once a more popular place, but now not so much.  There are lots of empty, unused spaces which kind of make it feel like a bit of a ghost town.

They accept credit cards and for my husband and I it was a total of $13 US for both cenotes.  They are both underground cenotes, so if you\\'ve never seen this type, then it\\'s worth stopping by.   \\n\\nLots of the cenotes in the area are more open and have jumping platforms or rope swings.  For safety reasons, this place doesn\\'t have either.  It\\'s dark inside. The water is also a little cooler, but there were plenty of people swimming.  \\n\\nThese weren\\'t our favorite cenotes, but we love all cenotes and never think that visiting one is a waste of time.\\n\\nThey take your photos on the way in.  We didn\\'t have a lot of photos of the two of us, so we bought the usb stick for 7$ US and used one of the pics for our Christmas card.  The quality is very good.  \\n\\nThe employees were very nice and they gladly called us a taxi when we were ready to leave.

We visited the cenotes at the end of October and having seen them in several stunning pictures before, I have to say that my first impression was so dissapointing with some of them.The reason was that due to the rain, not all of them were in the best condition and the famous blue colour and the transparent waters were not there.

Only reason why I give 4 stars is that I just don\\'t appreciate how once your are inside the park they charge you extra for the life vests, and even to use the restrooms. While I understand people in the nearby communities make a living of tourism it will be great if all services were included in the entrance fee and employees of the park were paid better. We only visited the X\\'Keken Cenote, so cannot comment on the Samula cenote.

We took a ferry from Isla Mujeres to Cancun, jumped on a Ado to Vallodolid, then booked a tour, after getting a cab catering rides to the Cenotes site. We were there on May 3, 2017. We paid $125 per person for both Cenotes. The prices varied depending on it you wanted food, ATV, and or horseback riding included in your tour. We elected for Cenotes only. Both were beautiful, offering something different. Xkeken had more stalagmites and stalactites lower to the water than the other, which gave a different feel for the place. The water is VERY cold, but once you jump in, you\\'ll be more than fine. There\\'s no inching your way into this temperature, you just have to go for it. I definitely recommend beach/pool shoes. \\n\\nThese natural wonders have fish (Garra rufa, I think they are called) that eat debris, bacteria and dead skin out of the water to keep it naturally clean, thus eliminating the need for chemicals (very cool, I think). There are ropes throughout both of the cenotes for those who are not so strong swimmers or just want to hang out in the water with a little assistance. We saw quite a few native bats in both locations. It was nice to see since they remained high in the top of the cenotes. I\\'m sure I would not hold this perspective had they been flying lower. lol They truly seemed unmoved by our presence.\\n\\nI didn\\'t give 5 stars because of the staff (Some were very nice and professional while others were, well... let\\'s just say they needed quite a bit of improvement). \\n\\nA Word of Caution: If you have health issues or are not in moderate to great shape take caution. The steps into the cenotes are a very long way down, with questionable footing in some areas, so watch your footing. On the way up, those with foot, leg, hip, lung, or heart problems may find this climb quite challenging. Pausing and taking great caution is recommended if you decide to experience this wonder.

The entrance to the cenote after walking through this market-like area is not marked at all (zero signage anywhere at this cenote telling you where to go) and you basically have to walk around aimlessly and try walking down different paths until you find it. \\n\\nI would recommend visiting this cenote for a one-time visit only, because the cenote itself is beautiful (and it would probably be less crowded first thing in the morning), however, I would not return for a second visit.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cenote Xkeken", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/84/88/e1/por-detras-se-encuentra.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Dzitnup", "addressLocality": "Valladolid", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "92976", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "273319080": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Breathtaking and Relaxing", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499453-d2187522-Reviews-Cenote_Xkeken-Valladolid_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/84/88/e1/por-detras-se-encuentra.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I followed the advice of many a guide and got there at the opening time (830am and not as I had been told 8am) and had the entire place to myself.

Whether you visit these Cenotes really depends on what you are looking for.  These Cenotes are quite developed and commercialized and have become popular with the tour buses, hence the natural beauty and tranquility of the Cenotes have been somewhat hindered. Unless you go there early in the morning, you will be sharing the Cenotes with numerous other people.  I personally prefer \\u201coff the beaten path\\u201d Cenotes, therefore the rating on these Cenotes reflect my personal preference.\\n\\nCenote Xkeken (aka Xquequen) is a \\u201cCave Cenote\\u201d, while its neighbouring Cenote \\u201cSamula\\u201d (directly across the road) is a \\u201cCavern Cenote\\u201d.  These Cenotes are completely separate from each other, each having separate entrance fees (of approx. 57 MX Pesos).  These Cenotes have been developed and are quite commercialized. There is a large parking lot for cars and tour buses, vendors, shops, washroom facilities, and optional life jacket rentals.  .\\n\\nCenote Xkeken, Cave Cenote, is lit up with artificial lighting, providing light to an impressive display of stalactites and what I assume are colourful mineral deposits in the rocks.  Lighting in this Cenote is necessary, as it would be pitch black if there were no artificial lighting, however the choice of having \\u201cchanging coloured lights\\u201d was a bad idea. Dim white lights would be much better in preserving the natural integrity and beauty of the cave.  There is a walk-way around 1/3 of the Cenote providing various spots for families and swim gear. The stairs into the Cenote are very sturdy and user-friendly.\\n\\nCenote Samula is directly across the road from Xkeken. Samula is a Cavern Cenote which is lit by a natural hole in its ceiling where spectacular beams of sunlight penetrate the surface of the water  - - a natural skylight!  There are impressive stalactites and tree roots descending from the Cenote\\u2019s ceiling. There are sturdy stairs into the Cenote, however they are steeper than the neighbouring Cenote, and they can get a bit slippery, so caution is suggested. From the two Cenotes, Samula is by far my favourite Cenote.   \\n\\nGPS Co-ordinates for Parking  = N 20 39.738, W 88 14.623", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cenote Xkeken", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/84/88/e1/por-detras-se-encuentra.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Dzitnup", "addressLocality": "Valladolid", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "92976", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "251858152": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Disappointed", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499453-d2187522-Reviews-Cenote_Xkeken-Valladolid_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/84/88/e1/por-detras-se-encuentra.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We took a shared minibus at Calle 41 and 44, and paid 20 pesos per person.

It costs 59 pesos and it is in a cave. It is better to visit it around midday till 2pm to see the ray of light that comes through the hole in the ceiling. Beautiful. Also, in front of it there is another cenote called Setumal, it is less impressive but it is also in a cave. 59 pesos as well. You can swin in both of them, but it is nicer xkeken. You can get to both of them from Valladolid getting a colectivo (they are located in the corner of 44 and 41). If colectivos are full they will charge you no more than 20 or 25 pesos. If they are empty they might charge you the same as taxis (70 pesos per 2 ppl). You can also rent a bike in one of the hostels (hostel cinco calles or hostel el fraile) for 15 pesos/hour or 70/day and ride yourself 6km through a unpaved bike path. Another good option being in Valladolid is Cenote Oxman, 4 km away with the bike, just take Calzada de los Frailes till the church, turn right on 49 and left on 54 and is all straight. It costs 30 pesos and it is really nice (not known by tourists). Of course, cenote Zaci, downtown is really awesome, 25 pesos. Suggestion: if you want to visit everything in one day, take a colectivo to Xkeken and Setumal and then back and rent a bike to go to Oxman once you are back. We did Ek Balam in the morning, cenotes after than and finally Oxman with the bike.

The water was great - cold at first but you got used to it - and floating under the opening where the sun shone through was extremely relaxing. We were there with a literal busload of teenage girls, and when they all left, we had the place to ourselves. Magical.

We left to visit the second cenote when the screaming crowd of revelers arrived. Sak Muu Ja is far different but just as gorgeous.  We were amazed at the azure water smack in the centre: brilliant and so clear it looked only 3 feet deep!  We were alone for at least a half hour and when people arrived, it was one other couple and an awesome fella by the name of Mike from NYC who were all happy to just enjoy the peace and beauty of the cenote.  The only downside was forgetting our camera -we both thought the other had it!  Postcards for sale for a dollar with many truly stunning images saved the day.  We took a taxi from Vallodolid to Dzitnup for $6.00 (USD) and the trip back cost $8.50 (USD) because the driver said we were going further than the main plaza.  Still well worth it!  The cost of entering the cenotes is minimal for what you see and experience.

They accept bus tours in the morning and early afternoon and then the small tours in the afternoon.  We were the only two on the tour and after hearing about the history of the area and doing the tour of the cavern area, we arrived at the water level.  The guide told us to jump on in and that he would be back in 45 minutes.  He left us alone to marvel in the quiet beauty of the Cenote.\\n\\nThe water is cool but you get used to it quickly and after about 15 minutes of exploring the area in the water, we just sat down next to one of the underwater lights and talked and enjoyed the scenery.  We would suggest wearing water socks since the bottom of the Cenote has some larger rocks and partial stalagmites poking up from the bottom.  \\n\\nAfter finishing the tour, we had dinner and it was one of the best meals that we had that week.  The ground Pumpkin Seed and tomato salsa and chips was delicious and the main course of Pollo Pibil (cooked underground) was extremely tender and moist and served with vegetables, rice and refried beans.

Following the swim, we changed clothes and ate a delicious 3-course Yucatecan dinner of chips and sikil pak, chicken pibil, rice, and beans, and marzipan for dessert.

This was one of the highlights of our fourth trip to Yucat\\u00e1n, and both 4.5 and 6 y o loved it.\\n\\nAs we were driving in the increasingly middle-of-nowhere road with wild vegetation on the sides, it got completely dark, and I though this started to look unsafe and a bit scary. My fears were relieved when we saw a nice parking lot (the parking lot entrance is 300 yards past the actual location on Google maps, with blue flags) and three other cars pulled in at the same time as us. \\n\\nThere were two guided groups, Spanish-speaking and ours, English speaking, the latter was us and one more person. In total there were close to 20 tourists, on the day after Christmas. \\n\\nIt\\u2019s a good idea to bring a long-sleeved top at this time of the year, as air was 18 C by the time we left. Also, it\\u2019s not worth bringing a snorkel in the cave - not much to see - or anything else besides a swimsuit (wetsuit is perfect if you have one) and a towel. \\n\\nThe tour included getting two shaman blessings, to enter the cave, and then later to swim in the water. First there is walking in the cave admiring cave formations and listening to the Mayan stories, maybe 45 min. Then we got in the water and swam- it was shallow, you could stand half of the time. Apparently, the water level varies and it was on a low side. The water was on the cold side but everyone except one person got in, the last person exited the water after 40 min of swimming.\\n\\nThe dinner that followed was fantastic - perhaps the best we\\u2019ve had on our 11-day trip. Simply AMAZING food - not your typical contemporary Mexican tacos but genuine Mayan flavors - marinated in achiote and not at all spicy (unless you add sauce). The freshly made tortillas were incredible. We couldn\\u2019t help but ask for half of the recipes which the family gladly shared. We appreciated the fact that the owners checked with us if it\\u2019s ok to give dessert to kids before doing so (we were making tortillas while kids were still at the table). Making tortillas was fun, and even our 4.5 and 6 y o made their own, and loved eating their creations.\\n\\nApart from our own enjoyment, it is important to note what this family did for the cenote.

The cave was breathtakingly beautiful and the stalagmites and stalactites were equally impressive. The thing that made this cave more special was the legends of the Maya that were told to us as we decended into the cave. Once at the tourquise, dimly-lit spring, they gave us all the time we wished for to spend alone, only to lead us to a traditional Mayan house where we had tortilla lessons (we were terrible at making them) and homecooked Mayan dishes and drinks.

When I walked in to the convent, there was a service being held, which was interesting to sit in on for a little while. \\n\\nWhat I really enjoyed about this place, was just wandering around through the pastel pink coloured corridors, checking out the central courtyard, the cenote/water wheel in the beautiful gardens behind the convent and peeking around in small rooms and climbing narrow staircases in random areas around the building.

Walking down to the cenote was a mystical experience and sighting the platform in the cenote was simply mind blowing.  There was a small opening in the ceiling of the cenote and it illuminated the turquoise water. It\\u2019s the most picturesque and beautiful in every possible way of three cenotes I visited (Oxman, Zaci, and this one).  Apparently, there was a demonstrative Mayan ceremony in the cenote at around noon because there were three beautifully body painted Mayans walking out the cenote when I walked down to it.  One of them carried a dish of burning vegetation resembling sage but it had a distinctive smell.  I looked at the brick wall circling an opening before I walked down to the cenote cluelessly. It was the opening that brought the light to the cenote underneath.  It was spooky to think about people walking on the ground right above the cenote. There is a retailer and a cafe to browse.

It was too beautiful of a spot to pass up on this trip!\\n\\nThe cenote is located in Valladolid, about a 10-minute drive from the city centre. You can get there by taxi from the main ADO bus station for about MXN80-120 pesos (our guy charged us MXN120). On the way back, our taxi driver charged us only MXN60. We were coming in from Tulum after a long morning full of shooting along Tulum Beach. For those planning to visit from Tulum, I advise taking the ADO bus. It\\'s super easy and costs MXN98 per person. I\\'m sure you can take the bus from other places, but I\\'m not sure how long it would take or what the costs are. When taking the bus, do allow yourself enough time (if visiting in the afternoon) to get there. Our bus ran a little slow and took just over 2 hours to arrive in Valladolid. After hopping in a cab, we ended up getting to the cenote around 4:15pm. I was under the impression that it closed at 5:00pm (my Google search informed me as such), so I was afraid we would only have an hour to take photos. But when we arrived the lady at the front told us we had until 6:00pm. I\\'m not sure if this is only on Saturday, so double check just to make sure before going. The entrance fee was MXN80 per person (cash only). Compared to a lot of really popular cenotes in Tulum, I found this to be pretty affordable.\\n\\nIf you want to enjoy the cenote without a lot of people around, I recommend going mid- to late afternoon. This way, you can avoid the large crowds from tour buses and even have the place to yourself. Plus, by that time, people have left because they\\'re off to another activity/dinner and not many more will arrive because it\\'s simply so close to closing. When we got there at 4:15 pm, we were legit the only tourists there. We entered into the cenote as two people were leaving and had the whole place alone for a good half hour (before a large group came). For photo purposes, we waited until they left and asked the security guard if we could spend some extra time (5 min) for some last photos and he kindly agreed. That\\'s another thing - all the staff here are so friendly!\\n\\nI do think you should be careful if you or anyone in your group has mobility issues. The steps may be steep for some and can get very slippery from all the water that people bring along with them while passing in/out.\\n\\nThe cenote itself is so beautiful and the water is so so clear. It really looks like something out of a movie. And you can even see lots of little catfish swimming around. It\\'s so nice and can be really enjoyable if you go during down times so you\\'re not fighting crowds. Although I\\'m happy we went at the time we did, we did have to make the trade off of not getting that beam of light shining through the top of the cenote. Had I had the time, i would\\'ve probably spent all day there to photograph it! Maybe next time ;)\\n\\nThis is definitely a must-see if you are in the area.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Suytun Cenote", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/ff/8f/fa/suytun-cenote.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera Ticuch Km 8 S/N", "addressLocality": "Valladolid", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "97780", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "633418762": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Wonderful cenote", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499453-d3670509-Reviews-Suytun_Cenote-Valladolid_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/ff/8f/fa/suytun-cenote.jpg", "datePublished": "November 14, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Was exactly what expected.

You could eat as much as you liked and the quality of the food was good. The waiter /waitresses were friendly and there was a short Mexican dancing display to entertain guests. \\n\\nNow for the negatives... \\n\\nLike other reviews have highlighted a significant amount of effort by the owners are spent assertively/at time forcefully attempting to get you to purchase items. This starts  prior to getting to the venue when the tour guide informs you of the Mayan Birth certificate (400 Mexican Pesos) as well as the Necklace (900-2,000 Mexican Pesos). Also you have to walk through the gift shop prior to getting to the Cenote which is manned by what seemed like an army of salesmen/women who actively push the souvenirs. The quality of these could not be doubted but what was frustrating was the varied nature of the pricing of these items which seemed to be based on what the individual felt they could achieve. This view was confirmed by the fact the shop floor staff who \\u2018helped you choose\\u2019 having to inform the checkout staff of the selected items price.\\n\\nThere were no changing rooms for the cenote and we were informed to either change in the toilet or the jungle behind the cenote. Also it is mandatory to wear a life jacket when swimming in the cenote (even though the water is shallow and can be stood in at all times). What was more frustrating however, was that you had to pay extra for the life jacket which was not advertised. This was compounded by the fact that the individual who informed us of the need said the price was 20 Pesos whilst the other suggested it was actually 30.\\n\\nThe drinks in the inclusive buffet were not included in the price and the price ranged from \\u00a35-10 for soft drinks. \\n\\nFinally we were joined by a student from the Mayan village who gave us a free shot of a local drink and taught us the Mayan toasting tradition. This was interesting but it was  followed by giving us a bottle of the drink with our picture on. We were then asked to either hand the bottle back to the student or purchase the alcohol. We of course purchased it (for an expensive price), but this was a further clever way to charge tourists.\\n\\nAll in all I would certainly recommend visiting this beautiful location and chance to learn about the Mayan culture. However, just be prepared for the push to spend lots of money", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Suytun Cenote", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/ff/8f/fa/suytun-cenote.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera Ticuch Km 8 S/N", "addressLocality": "Valladolid", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "97780", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "552762043": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Off the beaten path beauty", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499453-d3670509-Reviews-Suytun_Cenote-Valladolid_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/ff/8f/fa/suytun-cenote.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "2 cenotes here, one for viewing and the other is like a magical cathedral.

If you are coming here on a day trip with part of a tour, then yes a score of 4 or 5 is merited if you have never seen a cenote before. This is only a review of the services we received by renting a cabin on the property and staying a few days. By Mexican standards we paid a good price, however, they were short toilet paper and even towels for the rooms, (my Mexican family had brought both toilet paper and towels). There was no toilet seat in one of the rooms (we rented three cabins) which caused problems for my 86-year-old mother-in-law who uses a wheelchair. It is a common practice to remove toilet seats in public restrooms or some restaurants, but not when you rent a hotel room or a cabin. In the first room we had no AC, so they changed us to another room in which there was no antenna for the TV. They literally ran out of food at breakfast, but there was enough food put aside for the bus tours which arrived a couple of hours later. There was no bartender at night, so we were limited to beer, tequila shots or rum and coca. There was no wine of any kind. As is normal in Mexico we brought hammocks from home, but they were missing hooks with which to hang them. If you\\'re from North America or Europe, you wouldn\\'t normally expect them, but for a Mexican family this was not particularly cool. They closed the cenote at 5 p.m. as soon as the last bus tour was done. There was no music at night, even though they had speakers there for the daytime tourists. The staff were nice and did their very best to accommodate us, but we were left with the impression that this was a cash grab for the owners who made their money from the daytime bus tours.  Over all, I would suggest you go there to see the cenote which is worth it, but stay in a hotel in the pueblo, not on the property itself.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "1"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Suytun Cenote", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/ff/8f/fa/suytun-cenote.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera Ticuch Km 8 S/N", "addressLocality": "Valladolid", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "97780", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "306143636": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Excellent Cenote", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499453-d3670509-Reviews-Suytun_Cenote-Valladolid_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/ff/8f/fa/suytun-cenote.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We came here on a trip to Chichen Itza, the tour stops at the Cenote to allow you to do some shopping and then swim.

Yep, you can rappel down - they show you how and cheer you On! If you freeze up or lose your grip, people below have you anchored and can lower you the rest of the way. Trt to keep your eyes open. The walls are beautiful! You come down to a person standing in the water who will help you stand also. Step off the platform and swim to the edge. Once there, you can zip out over the deeper parts and drop into the water or jump in from various heights. They take pictures of each person multiple times, which are made available to you for an additional cost.  Life vests are provided if you would like to use one. There are also some tubes. Both are free to use. After walking out thru a cave, we changed back into our regular clothes and walked through the Mexican jungle to a replica Mayan home, and an authentic Mayan meal. Try the food, it is really delicious! Listen when you are told sauces are mild, medium, hot and really hot. They are exactly what they say. Try the chicken cooked in chocolate. It really is amazing! After another short walk through the trees to see more of the beautiful country,  your ar e ready to move on!

This is a high ceiling, gorgeous, large cenote. You can zip line and fall into the water, jump off high/low platforms or just swim and enjoy the beauty of this sinkhole.

You can either rappel into the cenote or go down the steps. I rappelled cause why not? They were very safe. Once you reach the water it is freezing cold. Freezing but oh so neat. You can jump off of several platforms into the water, There were 2 ziplines into the water. I tried it all and it was amazing. It is not an experience I will soon forget. \\nAfter we got done swimming, we had a Mayan buffet lunch. It was organic food that the Mayan cooks prepared themselves. \\nBefore we left you can, of course, purchase the pictures they took of you in the cenote. We bought the complete CD and it was $53.

They don\\'t allow you to bring your own cameras and for good reason - they will want to sell you photos taken by their staff who do a very good job.

We were picked up outside our resort (Moon Palace) perfectly on time, in a nice Sprinter-type van, picked up a few more people, and our group of six adults and six children was off to Chichen Itza followed by a trip to this quiet cenote.  I mention Chichen Itza because it was so amazing to cool off and clean up after the busy, hot tourist destination at the cenote before the long ride back to Cancun!\\n\\nThe drive to the cenote allowed us to see a different side of Mexico that is different from what we experience in the oasis of Canc\\u00f9n. It was safe, but my children got to understand on a new level the poverty and hardship in some parts of Yucat\\u00e1n \\'s jungle through the large, tinted windows of the bus. Seeing the homes made of sticks reminded us all of the level of luxury in which we live, and sometimes take for granted.\\n\\nDeparting from the bus in the park, we strolled through absolutely lovely organic gardens teeming with love and fresh food. This was a great teaser for our lunch, which was just around a few more corners....\\n\\nLunch was amazing!!! I had concerns because my sons cannot eat gluten, and I was hoping there would be a variety of food they could enjoy. There was actually MORE than they could handle! Fresh corn tortillas (handmade before your eyes), rice and beans, chicken, salads, lime soup, eggs with chiya, plus other gluten-filled dishes for the gluten-ous! ;). Drinks included hibiscus water (sweetened, cold, and delicious), rice water with vanilla (sweetened), plain water, and commercial beverages (for purchase).  Our meal was so amazing, I was a little sad that I could never repeat it without coming back!\\n\\nAfter lunch, we changed in swimsuits and put our belongings in lockers, including shoes! The lockers were a beautiful high-gloss wood, and the bathrooms were clean and not smelly, due to being somewhat open air (raised-platform cubicles under thatch). Soap and sinks were very nice!\\n\\nWe were led to participate in a ceremony to cleanse us (smudging) and requests to grant us permission to visit and safety in the cenote. Lovely ceremony!\\n\\nWe then walked to the showers and got off sunscreen grime, dirt, vanity products, etc to help preserve the cenote waters. The showers were open-air and kinda fun!\\n\\nA few steps down a path, and there was the hole in the ground leading to our cenote! We were nearly swooning looking at the long rappel lines descending into the dark waters. My husband went first, new to rappelling, and the instructors (Herman and Pepe) were very clear and encouraging.  After a lot of nervous laughter, he easily descended, and quickly yelled up to us that it was &quot;Awesome!&quot;\\n\\nMy 16-year-old son followed, equally nervous, but managing to put on a big smile for the camera! His twin brother wasn\\'t feeling it, and decided today was not his day to try rappelling, and the guides were very supportive of his last-minute decision to bail, as he was literally on the edge of the platform. The local workers were very nice about not wanting him to feel badly.\\n\\nSo, he and I descended some slippery stairs carefully. By the time we got to the water\\'s edge, my other son was already snorkeling around, enjoying the clear water and even saw a fish!  We swam...the water was cool but SO refreshing!\\n\\nWe had the whole cenote to our group of 12 for a very decent amount of time. Several grown-ups and kids enjoyed the two zip lines. I personally enjoyed just floating on my back, staring at the limestone ceiling and the hanging tree roots. There were many inner tubes available for floating. I loved that they didn\\'t make me wear a life vest! After the year\\'s cancer surgeries, I floated, visualizing my body being healed from the sacred waters. It was one of the best swims of my life. My husband said I looked so happy and healthy afterwards!!!\\n\\nThe exit walk was nicely lit, a ramp, like exiting a cave.  Next stop was a building with plenty of large computers to view the extensive pictures taken! Images were already sorted by family. We laughed and sighed at many pictures...there are some priceless ones, such as my husband and son rappelling side by side, showing the length of their descent. We got all pictures, video of the ceremony, pics of the site and its flora, plus traditional music on a USB for only $63....a very very fair price! I was so happy to hand off camera duty to someone else so I could be fully present, AND support the local Mayan economy. Since the pics were less than I anticipated, I purchased some lovely woven blankets in the gift shop. While CDs and USBs were being loaded, we had complimentary margaritas! \\n\\nThe day and place was fantastic, but Herman and Pepe were outstanding guides, here and at Chichen Itza. Incredibly knowledgeable and fluent in English (and French, Italian, and German for Herman!) I always felt safe riding with Chico behind the wheel, as well!!!\\n\\nAmazing day!!!\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cenote Maya Park", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/89/3c/0a/cenote-maya-park.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Road Chemaxenas de Uspibil - Chacmil, Km 3", "addressLocality": "Valladolid", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "463238770": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Amazing Cenote, great service, poor product concept", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499453-d4004202-Reviews-Cenote_Maya_Park-Valladolid_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/89/3c/0a/cenote-maya-park.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I loved the cenote and the experience.

The pictures they take are quite bad (anyone with a decent camera can take the same pictures). If you are going to charge extra I would expect to get some spectacular shots with great angle, light, different lenses, underwatter pictures, etc. \\n\\nI honestly believe that they should allow you to bring your own camera and offer the pictures as an extra. if they would put a little more effort in the &quot;production&quot; side I would be willing to pay extra. Another down side is that you have this photo guy following you everywhere.... it\\'s ok at first but by the end of the day you\\'ll end up hating having him there all the time. \\n\\nOverall it is worth it, especially if you are visiting from outside of M\\u00e9xico.\\n\\nPS. if you go there, please avoid any sunblock or mosquito repellant.

Personally, my favorite place in the world. If you want to experience Mexico and the local Mayan culture in a friendly safe place, you need to see Cenote Maya.

To reach the cenote you\\'ll walk through a maze of incredible botanical gardens. There is a dining area and a locker area. To reach the cenote, you\\'ll need to give up all your worldly possessions and stow them away. I insist on carrying a tripod everywhere and the nice staff let me stow it behind the counter until later. So now, the only thing left to do is rappel down. You have to. On the tour, I saw a lot of people shy out. I assure you, it\\'s the best part of the experience.  Just do it.\\n\\nThen you just look around you, and for a moment, you know you\\'re in a sacred place of some kind. The scale of the cavern and the weird lack of echo is a factor. Maybe it\\'s the crystal clear blue water, or the cathedral-like rock. \\n\\nHang out. Dive. Zipline. Float around on a tube. Whatever you want.

When we arrived there was only another group that was slightly ahead of us (we had approximately 18 people in our group). After we had completely the Mayan ceremony, we made our way to the cenote where we repelled in. Just as the last of our group made their way to the water level in the cenote the other group was leaving. This felt like you had the whole place to yourself.\\n\\nAfter spending a bit of time playing on the zip line, ropes, and ledges that you can jump off it was time for us to go. Shortly before leaving we saw a small sea turtle swimming by the main platform - which was really amazing!\\n\\nAfter cleaning up we were treated to a mayan buffett, which was delicious. From local drinks to different types of local food I thought it was a hit. Shortly after eating, we purchased photos from the morning. Local Mayans were tought to be photographers so while you\\'re enjoying yourself in the cenote they take your photo\\'s. I thought it was aweseome how Alltournative was giving back to the community by providing jobs and techinical training!\\n\\nThe second half of the day was a bit more of a bus ride from the cenote to the ruins at Ek Balam. After a bit of a brief history run down provided by our fantastic tour guide Danique, we had a bit of time to explore and climb to the top. Again because of timing with groups it really felt like you were alone experiencing the sights which was a huge contrast from having recently seen Tulum!\\n\\nThe day never felt rushed, and felt quite informative. The staff was positive and friendly and eager to share/answer any questions you had.

I got many tour offers to this park for $ 250 for me and my husband. The tour included transportation to the cenote, Chichen Itz\\u00e1, Valldolid, lunch buffet and transportation back to our hotel. Well we did not want to do the buffet lunch as we preferred to eat at a local restaurant in Valladolid so we rented a car instead and went on our own. If I may add I also got offered the tour to the Cenote for $50 USD, including lunch buffet. So as I was saying, my husband and I rented a car and went on our own. When we got to the cenote and even though I said to the guy selling tickets we only wanted to see the Cenote and swim, apparently the park did not have any other fee but that offered to us at the hotel! Then the guy said to me &quot;if you tip me well I will see what can i do for you. He said he could charge me $30 as I was Mexican but my husband was a bit tricky as my husband was clearly a foreigner (he is Canadian and white with blonde hair and green eyes) and he (staff) may get in trouble. Then he changed his story and say he would charged us the equivalent of 75 USD for the two of us. We declined. Chichen Itz\\u00e1 charges $20 USD per person! I was willing to pay that just to get in but I was not willing to get robbed! I understand they need to pay staff wages but I think what was very disappointing to us was the guy\\'s shady attitude!

My group went as part of a guided tour by alltournative and our tour guide Artur was very informative and really got us all excited for the events. \\n\\nThe cenote is a long drive into jungle territory and you will pass by many small towns and villages. Artur was eager to explain the culture and answer all questions we had. \\n\\nComing into the cenote Park there is a long trail by which you travel to a clearing where a welcoming ceremony is performed by one of the elders. The ceremony is filled with Mayan blessings, incense, and the obligatory video recording that will be offered at the end of your trip. After the ceremony concluded, about 10 minutes, we were led to a mock Mayan house. They explain how Mayans lived in the past and how some still choose to reside. There are a few actors/villagers that wear the &quot;traditional&quot; Mayan garb and event costumes. \\n\\nFollowing the mini Mayan village, we were taken to complimentary lockers to store the few belongings we brought from our tour van. After locking everything up, you\\'re directed to some showers to wash off any sweat, soap, deodorant, etc. The water is frigid but it\\'s a requirement since you\\'ll be swimming quite literally in their water supply.\\n\\nAfter the shower you\\'re given an option of walking down stairs to the cenote (boring) or rapelling down through the top directly into the water below (a lot of fun). Life jackets are available to anyone who isn\\'t comfortable swimming. The rappel lines are all very secure, the harnesses and equipment in great shape, and guided below acting as belay if you need help. It was a lot of fun even for those with me that were afraid of heights. You descend into the water below which, in all honesty, is cold. After the initial shock it was great and extremely refreshing since prior to this you\\'ve likely been in the hot, humid jungle for hours. \\n\\nOnce in the cenote you swim to a landing to take off your harness and gloves. After that you\\'re on your own for a while. Activities in the cenote are two jumps/dive platforms at different Heights, a Tarzan swing, tight ripe walk, and tubes to float around in. The water is clear and if you have goggles you can take a look at the fish that you\\'re swimming with. \\n\\nBe sure to look around and take it all in. It\\'s a giant cavern half filled with water and with the roof opened up. Quite unlike anything I\\'ve ever had the opportunity to experience before and totally awe inspiring. Tons of photos will be taken of you this entire time and when you\\'re about to leave they\\'ll have you pose with your group and again as couples. \\n\\nAfter you\\'re done in the cenote, you go back to the lockers and get changed. Towels are provided for you which was nice because your feet end up stained with clay from the walk leading to the lockers. Once done changing they will bring you to lunch. \\n\\nThe food was all so good. Not sure if it was because of 4 days of all-inclusive resort food or if this was truly just so great, but several of us agreed the black beans specifically were hands down the best we\\'ve ever had. \\n\\nAt this point you\\'re tired from a long day, well fed, and about to be presented with the photos of your adventure. The prices were actually very reasonable when split amongst the group. We got our a and we\\'re very happy with how they turned out. You do get to preview everything before you decide to purchase. It\\'s an all-or-nothing deal so you don\\'t just pick a few pictures, you get the entire collection they took of all pictures you\\'re in. \\n\\nLast stop is the gift shop that has the items you\\'d probably expect to find. They have complimentary margaritas available for you as well (they are an odd brown color I can\\'t begin to explain). \\n\\nI\\'d highly recommend participating in this experience if you\\'re visiting the area and have the opportunity.

However, our main guide Erik made the trip hilariously entertaining. With a mix of wit, sarcasm, and detailed information about the rest of our day, Erik was an incredible breadth of knowledge. He made the trip pass by in the blink of an eye, mainly because he had most of our van in stitches for the majority of the ride.\\n\\nOur group went to Ek Balam first, a Mayan acropolis that has only bee open to the public for about 5 years. While there were other groups at the site, which made the place a bit crowded,  Erik as well as the Mayan guide made the trip very worthwhile. Both were very knowledgeable, earnest, and willing to answer any and all questions to the best of their abilities. Erik was currently in the process of studying archaeology at the local university, so he knew a lot more history compared to an average guide. You can tell that he embraced the culture respectfully and with great care.\\n\\nOne of the refreshing things about the excursion was the familiarity everyone felt towards Erik. It was obvious that he personally cared a lot about the culture and the integrity of the location. \\n\\nAfter Ek Balam, we went towards Cenote de Maya. Erik explained the purification ceremony we went through before entering the cenote. The Mayan shaman had prayed for our group\\'s protection, peace, and continued well-being throughout our trip and beyond. It was a very humbling and once in a lifetime experience. \\n\\nThe cenote itself was magnificent. The location was just breathtakingly beautiful. Because our group was small and the tour company had exclusive access, we were able to enjoy the space without competing with other people. \\n\\nAll in all, I feel like the trip was well worth the money and time. I highly recommend this excursion.\\n\\nPS: If you get Erik as a guide, he\\'s also friendly with the stray dogs that hang around the area.

Admission is free but donations are highly encouraged (not &quot;required&quot; but customary). I would suggest going during an off time, like lunch hour, to have a smaller tour. Set aside about two hours of your time to fully enjoy the art and not rush or be rude to the tour guides.

Pictures and videos are aloud unless the tour guide says otherwise. Street parking is available outside and in the surrounding blocks. I would suggest leaving your bags in your car if you can because the art covers every surface of the house and it would be easy to knock something over with a backpack.

I wanted to point some things out that perhaps might go un-noticed but shouldn\\'t be missed.\\n\\nFirst of all the home is spectacular.  The story of the owners purchasing the home is really so fascinating.  Yes the artwork is glorious but pay attention to their story.  When you walk in, it\\'s sensory overload and might be hard to pay attention to the grand story of how this beautiful treasure came to be.\\n\\nAfter the tour guide finishes talking about the first area (the main entry-way) he will take you into the next room which is a hallway type area.  To the right in that room are some poster boards with several old photos on them.  Please pay attention, as these are photos that were taken of the owners standing inside the dilapidated walls of the once-then abandoned over-run home, that NOW is this beautiful mansion.\\n\\nI was fascinated with what the property use to look like.  Concrete walls, with no roof, and completely overgrown with foliage. Such vision for them to be able to see the potential in a ramshackle land.  The guide told us it took 12 days of 22 men (I think those are the numbers) to just remove the overgrown shrubs and trees and weeds!\\n\\nThe other item I wanted to mention is imagine them cutting and chopping down weeds and trees and vines that had been growing inside this concrete home for heaven knows how long.  And during the cutting and chopping, you decide to leave one tree.  Why this tree of all trees?  It is the coolest tree I think I\\'ve ever seen.  And it proudly is growing right in the open-aired courtyard/patio area. So very pretty. I think it\\'s called the Calabash Tree, or some form of this species.\\n\\nThe tree has perfectly round large green gourds growing from it.  It\\'s so unusual.  The guide said the Mayans, hundreds and hundreds of years ago, would use these gourds, once dried out, as bowls or as drinking vessels.  The inside of the gourd is poisonous but the green ball once cut in half and dried out will turn into a sturdy brown utensil.  They have a few samples of what the gourd looks like once dried that the tour guide will show you.\\n\\nI just find it so neat that of all the brush and weeds they were cutting down, then chose to leave that tree standing (heaven knows how old I is)  And the tree grows beautifully in the open-aired courtyard.\\n\\nAnother item not to be missed is in each of the guest rooms, they have their own mini courtyard - please be sure to check out the wonderful cactus growing in the mini courtyards located in the guest rooms.  I know the artwork is so wonderful, it\\'s easy to overlook the wonderful cactus!\\n\\nYou can read other\\'s reviews of the stunning artwork, I just wanted to make sure you took time to look away from the art for a moment, and check out some other items.\\nLovely home in an absolutely darling darling town. Such a beautiful property. These owners are truly blessed to be able to own such a glorious place and to be able to travel around and add to their art collection.\\n\\nThe owner was sitting in the courtyard, visiting with a friend while the tour was going on.  So be aware, they actually live there, and you are walking into their home while they could be milling around.\\n\\nVery much worth seeing.

Each month, all money raised is given to a different community organization around Valladolid.\\n\\nOn a personal note: I work with an arts organization and had a few questions for John, so left my card with our guide. I was quite surprised that he personally emailed me a few hours later and invited us in for coffee the next morning! He spent over an hour with us, chatting over coffee and talking about his art, life, philanthropic work, and connection to Valladolid. This was above and beyond what we could have ever expected - it points even more to the genuine love and warmth put into the collection, John\\u2019s mission to expose more people to folkloric art forms, as well as the selflessness it take welcome strangers into their private (and, frankly, breathtaking!) home every day. \\n\\nIf you\\u2019re in Valladolid - this is 100% worth the visit (10:00 am sharp!).

It\\'s Mexican folk art, so a genre that needs to be handled with care. As you might expect, lots of bright colours, busy street scenes and plenty of skulls... and there is a lot of it, coming at you from all sides as soon as you walk in. Initial impressions are great, with plenty of eye candy and lots to entertain the kid in all of us. But wait... then there is another room ... and another room. There is no real organising principle, other than what might look good in a particular spot or space and the designs, motifs and colours start to repeat, and stick to the roof of your mouth...\\n\\nMore importantly, none of the art is attributed, so you learn nothing about the artist, their heritage or the artistic tradition in which they are working. For a museum that purports to be of the art of the people this is a serious omission. Where is the context ? What\\'s the history ? Where (in this complex country) is the politics ? Surely there is more that can and should be said about the art we are looking at ?\\n\\nThe error is compounded by a rather unfortunate focus on the patron and collector. I guess this is not unusual in the art world but is nevertheless still rather unattractive. Only one piece was singled out for specific comment on our guided tour, on the basis that it was the first piece in the collection, an attribute that speaks more to the history and evolving taste of the collector than it does to the art itself. The effect was heightened by a rather obsequious tour guide who insisted on inviting us to admire the good taste of the collector at every turn, and especially by the visit to the owners private quarters, where in a rather uncomfortable ten minutes we held our breath wondering if we might have the opportunity to meet the great man himself, before being informed that no he would not be meeting visitors that day.\\n\\nSo my advice to the Casa de los Venados -\\n- decide if you are going to be a museum or a private house, the combination does not work well\\n- if you are going to be a museum, do it properly. Give credit to the artists, organise the collection so your visitors can make sense of it and give us some information, context and intellectual stimulation to go with the eye-candy\\n- retrain your tour guides so they are better informed about the art than they are about the owners\\n- rename the collection if you want (credit where credit is due..) but then leave your role and ego above the door. If the Getty museum can do it then I\\'m sure you can to...\\n\\nTo my fellow travellers - \\n- worth a visit but expect to come away feeling like a kid at the end of a birthday party", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Casa de los Venados", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/f6/22/da/photo1jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle 40 Local 204", "addressLocality": "Valladolid", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "97780", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "552762735": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Astonishing Home and Art Collection", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499453-d1863475-Reviews-Casa_de_los_Venados-Valladolid_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/f6/22/da/photo1jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Tour led by amiable staff shows off this staggering art collection.

The cost is a mere 90 pesos (5USD) and proceeds go to local charities and infrastructure projects, a great cause. The tours start at 10am, keep in mind they are one hour behind costal time. After the tour I recommend one of the great cafes for lunch, or better yet buy some food from street vendors and sit in the city square and enjoy the scenery. After that we made our way down the street to Cenote Zaci for a refreshing swim.

The difference being that Mr. Venator is alive and well and still collecting. By chance he was home during our tour and my wife and I had a chance to speak to him about his love of Mexican art and culture. He was generous with his time and information. The collection has beautiful examples of many regions of Mexico. Our guide David was very informative and answered all of our questions. We learned the history of how different regions become known for distinct recognizable forms and material. Like the black clay of Oaxaca. The unique aspects of the collection though are due to the relationship the Venators forge with the artists. As Mr. Venator pointed out, when he meets an artist he likes and has collected, he gives them an opportunity to create something they\\'ve always wanted to do but felt constrained by either time or funding. We recommend calling for a reservation. All the proceeds from the admissions go to specific charitable causes within Valladolid and the Yucatan.

When I got there, I was the only one, and they kindly asked that I wait until a large organized group showed up to begin the tour around the mansion.\\n\\nAfter waiting nearly 45 minutes, with the large group still absent, the home\\'s owner personally greeted me and apologized profusely for the delay. Still the only one there, I had my own guide and the place to myself more or less, and in retrospect was very grateful and wouldn\\'t have it any other way! \\n\\nThe wait, although not anticipated or desired, was worth it, as the home was astounding! The tour guide was professional, polite, knowledgable and well-informed. He said the typical tour lasts about one hour. I think I ended up staying for 1.5 - 2 hours because I kept taking photos and asking lots of questions.\\n\\nThis aesthetic may not appeal to everyone (it certainly does to me, I felt I had died and gone to heaven, and heaven was this amazing Valladolid house filled with awesome arts and crafts!!), however, I still think anyone would be intrigued and awed by the scale and design of this home. The five different guest quarters each have their own thoughtfully decorated design scheme, the pool area is to die for, and the dining room table with the custom painted chairs is magnificent. \\n\\nMy favorite pieces are the Frida, Diego, Catrina wooden bench in the foyer, and the intricately painted wooden skulls in the living room bookshelf. \\n\\nThe center courtyard is so warm and inviting, I could easily imagine this being an excellent bed and breakfast or lovely venue for a wedding. \\n\\nThe owner, John, was welcoming and gracious. I loved the fact that all proceeds from the tours go to benefit the community. In the future, it would be wonderful if he published a catalogue of all the amazing pieces in his collection -- I would most certainly buy it.

The sign says daily tours at 10 am. it also says ring the bell for entrance. We arrived at the home about 1:30 or so and rang the bell. A very nice guide greeted us and gave us a most wonderful tour of the more than 3000 pieces of art selected by the owners over a lifetime of collecting. This is not your typical tour. You are actually taken from room to room through the private home of the owners. We were fortunate enough to meet both John and Dorianne who were casually enjoying a rest in the vast courtyard and then what looked like a wonderful lunch. Their dog followed us throughout the tour and often led the way.\\nThe art collection can not be adequately described it is so vast and diverse. They have commissioned many of the pieces and my favorites were the hand hammered copper vases, the murals, the  art in the Frida Kahlo room and the dining room chairs.  The architecture and restoration work that was done on this building is exquisite. The pool area is breathtaking. All in all  you should not miss this gem.\\nWithout a doubt one of our most favorite parts of our first visit to the Cancun area. they have a website and it has a video tour of the place but like all things this place must be experienced in person. casadelosvenados.com\\nThank you John and Dorianne for opening your home up to us.

Mexican folk art is fascinating, colorful and full of personality, and this collection is amazing.

The building is just around the corner from the main square in Valldolid. We met the personable owners while there, who were having lunch as a staffer gave us a tour in good English. In particular, there are separate rooms that are tributes to Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, and many fine examples of costumed skeletons that we learned actually were not Dia de los Muertos pieces as we thought, but began as political satire pieces done by local artists in protest over wealthy colonial rulers. There are many humorous, touching and quirky pieces the owners had commissioned, and even functional furniture that are art pieces.

The home is huge and just a couple doors from the central plaza making it very easy to find. They purchased the home in early 2000s and took 8 years to completely restore it. They give tours every day at 10:00am. One of the owner\\'s staff members led the tour and his knowledge of the art and artists was amazing. I don\\'t know how he remembered all of the artists names for every piece, and what part of Mexico the piece was from. Even if you think you are not a fan of Mexican Folk Art you will love this tour. Seeing the home, where John and his wife live every day is fascinating. The home is often used for events and many Mexican politicians have visited and conferred various awards to John and his wife, who donate all admission donations to local charities. We chatted at length with John after the tour as he and my husband are both Rotarians. John even walked with us to town and helped us get a good deal at a nice shop.

However, I was not at all prepared for seeing this project up-close-and-personal.  It was vision which had become reality.

Indeed, Casa de los Venados has expanded that dining room museum-experience into a whole-house experience.\\n\\nI predict that Casa de los Venados will become the principal attraction for the region, and a must-see stop on any visit to the Yucatan Peninsula.\\n\\nI highly recommend a visit to Casa de los Venados from either Cancun or Merida.

We walked around the land for about 45 minutes. He taught us about trees that produce other products used in Mayan cooking and their spiritual beliefs. Jorge spoke great English, was very open and fun and organized. Then, he sat us at a table to taste three honeys produced on the land. He described in detail the importance of the bees in Mayan culture (they are stingless!!). The final tasting was from the sacred Mayan melipona bees. The honey was incredible, like fine wine. I can\\'t explain the feeling that we had after that tour, it was not only educational, but spiritual in a very grounded way, and fun. I cannot recommend this tour enough. He also has very rustic lodging and camping sites available for the adventurous:) An easy walk from in town, too!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Xkopek Parque Apicola", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/60/f1/67/xkopek-parque-apicola.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle 57 X 38 Ex Aviaci\u00f3n Colonia San Juan, a un lado del sindicato de taxistas Los Frailes", "addressLocality": "Valladolid", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "97783", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "440658290": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Really neat experience ", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499453-d10253919-Reviews-Xkopek_Parque_Apicola-Valladolid_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/60/f1/67/xkopek-parque-apicola.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We only stayed on night here but wish we could have stayed longer and will definitely be back on our next trip to Valladolid!

I took a taxi from Valladolid\\u2019s central area to the distillery, which is located just on the perimeter highway of the city (about 7 minutes\\u2019 drive). The taxi cost us 50 pesos on the way there and 40 pesos on the way back to Valladolid. The tour of the agave distillery cost 40 pesos. \\n\\nAs we drove towards the distillery, I saw fields upon fields of the blue agave plant. They were huge! The taxi dropped us off in the large and empty parking lot of the distillery. We were initially worried that the place was closed, because there was not a person in sight \\u2013 guests or staff. But once we walked inside the building and wandered around for a bit, we were able to find someone to give us a tour. \\n\\nSince we were the only ones at the distillery, we got our own personal and private tour. Our guide only spoke Spanish but I was still able to understand little bits of what she was saying (and I only know very basic Spanish). She showed us the agave plants in the fields surrounding the property and then took us inside the building where the agave plant was cultivated and transformed into the agave alcoholic drink and she explained the entire process and all of the steps involved. The agave is crushed using a horse pulling a stone wheel around in a circle. Our guide was informative and knowledgeable and it was a fascinating tour! I learned a lot of interesting facts \\u2013 for example, they cannot technically call the agave \\u201ctequila\\u201d because it is not made in the city of Tequila (located in Jalisco). I also learned that the agave alcohol is made from the \\u201cpina\\u201d which grows underground from the agave plant. The \\u201cpina\\u201d basically looks like a massive pineapple. We even got to try the fruit of the \\u201cpina,\\u201d which had a tough texture and tasted exactly like tequila! The distillery processes and bottles the agave on-site, stores it in wooden barrels to age it and then sells it to the public in their attached gift shop. \\n\\nAfter the tour, which lasted around 15-20 minutes, we were able to taste four different kinds of agave, which were all different ages. I enjoyed the milder tasting one the most. The staff were really fun and we got to wear sombreros while we took shots of agave! \\n\\nFollowing the tour and tasting, we were invited to browse through the large gift store attached to the distillery. They had a good selection of agave, as well as a large variety of other tequilas and alcohol. They also sold typical tourist souvenirs, various agave products and honey made from the agave, which tasted delicious! I enjoyed taking photos of the expansive agave plant fields after browsing the gift shop. The plants were so huge! \\n\\nFinding a taxi to get back to Valladolid was a little bit more difficult than I was expecting. We walked a little ways down the highway to the cloverleaf, where we stood and waited along the side of the highway for about 10 minutes or so, until a taxi came along. We flagged him down and got a ride back to Valladolid. \\n\\nI would definitely recommend visiting the Mayapan Distillery for a tour when you are in Valladolid!

This originally wasn\\'t on our radar, but while we were in line to enter the world heritage site, we spoke with some people that recommended it. This is a colonial town and the plaza is a great place to grab food, drinks and take a look at the cathedral. Be warned, they lock the gates at the cathedral and if you are inside walking around you may have to do a little running to keep from getting locked in. This happened to us and some people shortly after us. The history of the conquistadors is pretty tragic. For modern times, the town and architecture is very well preserved and a pretty picturesque blend of colonial buildings, arched walkways, patterned tiles, and multiple cathedrals. There are some tourists but it isn\\'t overrun by people. Parking is inexpensive and tucked behind buildings out of site of the pretty architecture. Restaurants and cafes line the plaza.

It\\u2019s a beautiful city, and it was unfortunate we did not have much time to visit. We would have liked to stay longer. The principal sites in Valladolid are well marked with signs in Spanish and English, which makes it nice for English-speaking visitors. \\nDominating the center of Valladolid is the Cathedral of San Servacio, which overlooks the  European-like Plaza e Parque Francisco Canton. This delightful square-shaped park is surrounded by shops selling food, handicrafts and souvenirs. A few vendors in the park offer ice cream and other goodies. Several in our group made a beeline from our bus to the ice cream vendor, and afterwards declared the ice cream delicious. A few blocks from this heart of the city is Cenote Zaci, which we unfortunately we did not have time to visit.\\nAccording to Wikipedia, Valladolid, named after the Spain\\u2019s capital city at that time, was established in 1543 near a lagoon. Apparently, the first Spanish settlers complained about the mosquitos and humidity in this ill-chosen spot, so two years later, Valladolid was moved farther inland to its current location. This place was apparently a good one, since it was already a Mayan town. This did not stop the Spaniards, however, and they built Valladolid version 2.0 on top of it. The Mayan buildings were dismantled and their stones used to build the colonial era-style churches and villas. As one may expect, this did not endear the indigenous Mayan population to their European interlopers and several conflicts followed. Nevertheless, by 1840 Valladolid had a population of 15,000 and was considered the third largest and most important city of the Yucat\\u00e1n Peninsula (after M\\u00e9rida and Campeche) until the early 1900s.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Plaza e Parque Francisco Canton", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/25/86/e8/plaza-e-parque-francisco.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Casco Historico", "addressLocality": "Valladolid", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "97780", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "457867772": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Perfect to get some food and peoplewatch&amp; San Servasio Cathedral", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499453-d4856261-Reviews-Plaza_e_Parque_Francisco_Canton-Valladolid_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/25/86/e8/plaza-e-parque-francisco.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Perefect palce to get some takeawayfood from any of the vendors in the street or from the nearby foodstalls a beer and peoplewatch and check out the Cathedral that is just in front, also veyr cool and confy weirdly designed chairs that face eachother ( you will know what I mean once there).

Until three years ago this place was a cattle ranch that used the cenote for watering the cattle. They decided tourism was more financially profitable and got rid of the cows.  It\\'s in the middle of no where, relatively new buildings for changing. All the employees are really nice, not sure if they speak much English. Unless you are there during a holiday or a tour bus arrives, it\\'s pretty empty. \\n\\nThere are two cenotes on the same site, Las Palomitas and Agua Dulce.  We chose Agua Dulce based on pictures and reviews. You pay for each cenote, no discount for both, so we just went to one. Please be aware that the decent into Agua Dulce is not for the faint of heart and if you have issues with heights, do not go here. The decent is a very tight and steep spiral stair case that is suspended, by some feat of Mexican engineering, by the roof and just floats on the water. I have issues with heights and almost turned back. We made it down, I wouldn\\'t recommend bringing bags down, the platform was covered in water except for the benches. I assume some days the benches are even covered. \\n\\nOnce inside it is really amazing. It is huge and deep and stunning. There are about three homes in the ceiling to light it as well as lights around the outside do you can see better. It\\'s a little chilly, I warmed up quickly. We had the whole cenote to ourselves, a guide stayed with us most of the time.  It really was relaxing and breathtaking. If you want off the beaten path, this is it.\\n\\nTo find it, leave Valladolid going west on 180.  Past Ticuch, there is a road to the North that will point to Cenote Maya and another pointing to the town of Yalkoba, both pointing the same direction. You follow the signs and go all the way through Yalkoba. In Yalkoba there is a sign that says 3 km Cenote Agua Dulce, it\\'s probably more like 5 km so keep going. One last thing, a kid followed us from the town on a bike, trying to convince us to go to his cenote instead. The people at Agua Dulce said a new cenote opened down the road with an island, we didn\\'t check it out though.

When we arrived it just closed but a lifeguard working there recommended Agua Dulce to us and said it was bigger and cheaper (100 pesos) entrance. He took his bike and showed us the way there. \\nWhen we arrived we there were only reception guys and we were the ONLY visitors. The lifeguard ( I am so sorry I don\\'t remember his name but he was incredibly kind and took great pics of us) took us to the cenote through a stair tunnel underground. \\nThe view took our breaths away. It was so quiet and only drops of water dripping from the stalactites broke the silence. The cave is I think one of the biggest in Riviera Maya, and very deep- 45 m max.

When we finally arrived about an hour ahead of a thunderstorm, we had the entire cenote to ourselves. There are two cenotes on the site, and we chose Palomitas since the other one required descent down a spiral staircase. Three easy access points to the water in Palomitas. The water was the perfect swimming temperature and an amazing aqua blue. The rock formations were stunning, and when the rain came down the single hole above, I knew I was in heaven.

There are several cenotes in the area, and they are not too touristy. I went to Cenote Palomitas on an excursion through Palace Resorts in Cancun. Like another reviewer said, I am hesitant to let this secret out because it is so nice without much overuse from tourists. It is a small operation with a bathhouse (that also rents out towels and life jackets), several huts selling goods, and an outdoor restaurant. The cenote itself is simply amazing, especially if you have never seen or swam in a cenote before. There are quite a few steps going down to the water level, and there are also several ropes you can hold on to while swimming (it\\'s 45 m/150 ft deep). The water temperature is a refreshing 25 C/ 77 F, and will leave your skin and hair feeling soft from the dissolved minerals in the water.  The restaurant where we ate lunch was delicious: there were plenty roasted meats, fresh tortillas, crisp vegetables, and creamy desserts all cooked by the local Mayan women. This cenote operation is designed to support the local Mayan villages.

The family who owns the land have made a huge effort and have built clean and new changing rooms, a lovely out door sink area to freshen up after your swim and have a little shop under a palapa where they sell Mayan crafts.  They are native Mayan speakers who also speak Spanish and are happy to share information, folk lore and - when we were there - their fresh fruit with us!  The cenote is about 30 meters down and you access it by walking down some very secure steps.  There is a very large platform with benches where you can leave your bags and towels and even have a picnic in the cool shade.  There are various ladders for entering the water as well as a 3 meter jumping platform.  There is even a paddle boat!  The trees and roots grow down to the water and you can watch beautiful birds in the trees.  We loved this cenote - it\\'s huge and unique and the family who runs it directly benefits from the modest entry fee of 50 pesos per person.  A must!  The cenote is marked with a sign and a palapa with bunting.  On highway 180 as you leave Valladolid it\\'s about 10 minutes from the town on the right.  If you hit Km 177 you have passed it.  The good gravel road takes you 650 meters to a large, shady car park area and it\\'s a short and delightful walk through the jungle to get to the cenote.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cenote Xux Ha", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/31/f3/88/this-cenote-was-amazing.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carr.

It is identified only by a smallish sign on the street. But what is inside is an enormous addition to the cultural attractions in the city. MUREM consists of a small entryway/gift shop, two display areas and a small, pretty garden in the back of the house. The collection of traditional clothing spans almost the whole of Mexico, and besides the kinds of pieces you would expect, such as the china poblana or the tehuana costumes that have become familiar through Frida Khalo paintings, there are unusual, unique and startlingly surprising pieces (plaid ???) that reflect  many years of careful collecting and researching. The  tour guides are extremely knowledgeable and speak Spanish, English and French, and perhaps other languages. The gift shop features unique and reasonably priced items that are made by artists and artisans from the region, not mass-produced in faraway factories. This museum is reason enough to plan a visit Valladolid, especially if you are traveling in or around Cancun or Merida. If you need a place to stay, the museum also hosts an airbnb, the profits of which support the collection.

Valladolid is a neat city with shopping &amp; restaurants all around the square.  My iPhone maps got us there easily but there are some turns, etc so make sure your GPS works or that you get the directions in some form to refer to before you get out of service area - it\\'s a remote drive.  Don\\'t get stuck driving back at night/after dark b/c most of the 1.5 hrs was remote with no light poles so the roads would be VERY dark if traveling at night.  Also make sure your vehicle is gassed up before you get stuck out on the remote drive.  There was one police checkpoint for us between Tulum and Coba - no big deal at all.  Just rolled down the window and told them where we were going.  \\n\\nPlease note that the cathedral closes sometime around 1pm (at least on the Saturday we were there) until 5pm.  No entrance fee.  We got there around 12 noon so had a good hour to look around, pray, and take pictures.  1 hour is about all you need.  After visiting the cathedral, we walked across to Las Campanas Restaurant to eat - very very good food and extremely cheap.  Good service too.  Spent rest of afternoon shopping in the area and bought a few things.  Driving back to Tulum we stopped in the village/city of Coba and were amazed at the local handicrafts made there.  Mostly dream catchers (some were HUGE) but also some woodcrafts, leather goods, hammocks and furniture.  The people of Coba were soooo friendly and nice and not pushy hovering like the shopping in Tulum.  We actually went back on Sunday afternoon to Coba to get a few more items - they were selling their goods, even on Sunday (I was wondering fi they\\'d be closed).   Better prices and easier to deal with shop keepers than in high-pressure, high tourist trap Tulum shopping.  Tulum has more types of items to buy but the shopkeepers there are very very pushy, hovering, and will try to rip you off (so practice your bartering skills before you got to Tulum!!).  If you got to Valladolid from Tulum, stop in Coba ....it\\'s only about 17 miles outside of Tulum and worth the drive if for nothing else just to see the most intricate, unique, and huge quantity of dream catchers you\\'ve ever seen.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Catedral de San Servasio", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/dc/dd/26/portal-da-catedral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Parque Principal Francisco Canton", "addressLocality": "Valladolid", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "487804990": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "traditional catholic church", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499453-d4064596-Reviews-Catedral_de_San_Servasio-Valladolid_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/dc/dd/26/portal-da-catedral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "we were there in a Sunday, so we stayed for the Sunday mass.

While it\\'s less present in the main square adjoining the church it definitely blights a number of side streets, it is the ugly facia of fast food establishments and utility shops which are at real odds with the charm that you find almost everywhere else around the town centre.

Plan your visit accordingly if you want to just see the chapel and be able to take photos inside. The interior is less ornate than many other churches of this period, largely because of the fire that destroyed it during the Caste War. While I would not call this church exceptionally beautiful in the aesthetic sense of the words, it is a very important location historically. It was here, inside these gates, that the Maya rebelled, beginning what would be known as the Caste Wars that reverberated thorugh the Yucatan.

From pictures, this chapel changes its look slightly in color scheme periodically while maintaining the historic integrity of the mosaics. \\n\\nThe drive is mainly on country roads, a couple of which were a bit rough. Nothing terrible and nothing that risks your rental car. During the time of our visit, there was not much going on around the church but I suppose this could be just the day we were there. (late Sunday afternoon) After other smaller towns we have visited, we were surprised there was no market or family gathering in the zocolo across the street. Perhaps they were all in nearby Valladolid for the larger Sunday markets.

But getting there was half the fun, tooling about in our tiny rental car on the back country roads, passing handicraft stalls and coconut vendors. \\n\\nSneeze and you might miss the turnoff, but once we arrived, we were rewarded with one of the most spectacular churches\\u2014 and the centerpiece of the town\\u2014 we had seen in our entire journey. This alone is worth a 20 minute detour to or from Valladolid.\\n\\nAccording to Wikipedia, &quot;The church was built originally by the Spaniards to enforce their culture in Uayma, which was at the time an important Mayan center. Stones from nearby Mayan temples (including Chichen Itza) were used to build the church, some of which can be seen on the facade.\\u201d\\n\\nThe reddish facade is adorned with beautiful white and blue rosettes unlike anything we\\u2019d seen in our travels. We had no way of knowing if they represented a traditional Maya design or had some Spanish influence. Regardless, the rosettes resembled many Mudejar designs seen largely in Andalusian architecture. With no one to guide us except a stray dog, we enjoyed exploring the church and were intrigued by a nearby house named the Casa de los Pianos. A local explained it was occasionally rented, often for tv and film productions. Neat!\\n\\nUayma is a great little village to explore if you enjoy admiring the local architecture. You can easily combine it with a trip to Valladolid, or on your way to/from Chichen Itza.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Templo y Ex Convento de Santiago Domingo", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/75/ab/c3/beautiful-church.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Uayma", "addressLocality": "Valladolid", "addressRegion": "Yucatan Peninsula", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "344455689": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A hidden colonial gem", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g499453-d9986267-Reviews-Templo_y_Ex_Convento_de_Santiago_Domingo-Valladolid_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/75/ab/c3/beautiful-church.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The Mayan town of Uayma is very  secluded in the outskirts of Valladolid and is surunded by jungle.

The town is very tranquil and there are no restaurants. there is however a bakery but it is not open all the time. you can bring your own food and sit and eat at the central plaza or park.
