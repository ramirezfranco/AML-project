Just make sure to go when the moonlight is at a minimum (or go on a cloudy night). And don\\'t be afraid to jump in and go swimming. It\\'s the only way to get the best out of the experience.\\n\\nThe boat tours are pretty cheap. You can book from Puerto Escondido to get travel included for about $300 pesos per person. Or just take a colectivo for $25 pesos per person up to the area and stop near Best Night Hotel La Laguna (south of the main Las Negras area). Tours can go as low as $150-$200 per person on a smaller boat from here. They leave around sunset.\\n\\nThe boats take you out to an area where the bioluminescence is the strongest, about 15 minutes out. Get over any fear and jump in the water to splash around! The movement causes the water to ignite. Splashing around is a lot of fun, and also a bit scary in the pitch-black water.\\n\\nIf you can, going out in the early morning for a bird-watching tour is great too. Not only is the lagoon beautiful and full of life, you can stop at an INCREDIBLE beach - Puerto Suelo. Our guide took us to La Palapa de Dona Juanita where we had an incredible fish and sopas for lunch at a great price - and basically had the entire shoreline to ourselves. You can even stay overnight here for $100 pesos per person. Just a simple cabana on the beach. There is parking just across one of the waterways and Dona Juanita will send someone in a boat to pick you up. Have to get in contact before you go. Or just take a tour out and make plans for them to come get you the next day.\\n\\nThis bird-watching and beach tour lasted 2.5 hours and only cost $700 pesos for the entire boat at the same tour operator near Best Night Hotel. This was after a bit of haggling though, so the prices may fluctuate and be higher if you have a bigger group.\\n\\nThe bioluminescent lagoon at Manialtepec is great. And Puerto Suelo is a hidden treasure. We honestly loved this beach more than Puerto Escondido\\'s Zicatela, Carrizalillo, La Punta - and more than the ones near Mazunte as well. \\n\\nIf you have any questions, don\\'t hesitate to reach out to us for more information!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Laguna de Manialtepec", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/11/58/b5/laguna-de-manialtepec.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Las Negras Mixtepec km 123 preguntar por Agust\u00edn o Gloria en el restaurant vista hermosa", "addressLocality": "Puerto Escondido", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "71981", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "648590329": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Bioluminescence ", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153373-d153456-Reviews-Laguna_de_Manialtepec-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/11/58/b5/laguna-de-manialtepec.jpg", "datePublished": "January 27, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "If you are in the area you should really do a bioluminescence tour.

I have seen this phenomenon in other places - Puerto Rico, Martha\\'s Vineyard - and know what I should expect.  I also knew that it was a full moon night, which is not ideal - so we called ahead.  &quot;Oh yes, you can still see everything!&quot; we were told.  So, we went that night, about 9 PM - calling before we left the Laguna de Manialtepec to again confirm that viewing the bioluminescence was possible despite the moon: &quot;Of course!  You can see 70%-90% of the bioluminescence!&quot; we were told.  So we arrive and the sales pitch begins.  &quot;Go with on a boat and it is $MP500 per person, or two on a private boat with your private captain for $MP1,000.  And you can leave now, no waiting&quot;.  We paid for a private boat and waited.  5 boats left before we were next.  We went out and it was totally dark.  The captain took us to 3 &quot;casitas&quot; (floating tents) in the water into which we were instructed to dive so that we could see the bioluminescence.  Understand....dive into the pitch black water to float inside of a 2 square meter cloth-covered floating cover in order to see anything in the water. There was NO bioluminescent activity anywhere else to be seen. We declined and went back to shore immediately.  We went to speak with the operator who said that yes, it was 70%-90% of the bioluminescent activity - INSIDE of the tent.  We did get our money back....and he had the audacity to ask for a tip.  I don\\'t know what it looks like on a dark moon, but beware of the full moon - and of flippant promises.

Javier came to our hotel (ArcoIris) in his SUV and we followed him along #200 in our car out to a property between to inns on the lake about twenty minutes north west of PE (just past La Alejandria). The road was good and the parking was free in the open, unsecured lot.  This is owned by Arturo who partners with Javier and who provided us with our guided 3 hour, 2 person private dusk /evening tour.  Javier will also provide transport to and from the tour.  His family operates the facility at Puerto Suelo, a beach out on the ocean side of the \\nlaguna, where a meal can be had.\\n\\nWe headed out on the lake (with life jackets) in the 20 foot fiberglass boat about an hour before sunset, prime time for birding and photography.  We were not disappointed with sightings of at least ten different species of birds, including King Fishers, Great White Egrets, Night, Blue and Tiger Herons, a Mangrove Black Hawk and numerous Cormorants, ducks and sea birds.   We did not see much in the water besides some very active small fish (one jumped in the boat) and a Sea Otter.   On the way back through the twilight and then moonlight, the frogs were at points extremely load.  Just before getting back to the car park we stopped at a small island which was filled with roosting egrets, herons and other large mangrove dwelling birds.  Though disturbed they appeared used to having lights played on them and did not take flight, though we were only a few feet away.\\n\\nPuerto Suelo consists of a few palapas and a beautiful, unpolluted, unoccupied beach with relatively small waves gently breaking across smooth white sand.  For the two of us it was a strikingly beautify place.  Aside from being served a meal (paid for separately from the tour) we were left alone here to enjoy the experience for about half an hour.  There were some sand fleas and mosquitos for which repellant largely worked.  The grilled shrimp dinner we had was OK, and not something to be rated here given our tour\\'s short notice and the fact it was paid for separately. This trip was a pleasant cool reprieve from the heat and hustle of the tourist beaches in PE.   The sunset and beach at this location is everything it is reported to be and worth the journey almost as much as the trip across the lake and through the mangroves   \\n\\nWe found Arturo to be very knowledgeable of the flora and fauna of the area.  He answered all of our questions (in English) and moved along at a pace seemed set more by us than him.  Likewise, while we did not have much of a chance to talk with Javier, we found his willingness to accommodate us to be exceptional and the price he charged, quite reasonable.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Laguna de Manialtepec", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/11/58/b5/laguna-de-manialtepec.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Las Negras Mixtepec km 123 preguntar por Agust\u00edn o Gloria en el restaurant vista hermosa", "addressLocality": "Puerto Escondido", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "71981", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "443909243": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Great birding: go early in the morning", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153373-d153456-Reviews-Laguna_de_Manialtepec-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/11/58/b5/laguna-de-manialtepec.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Just a 20 minute drive from Puerto Escondido, this is a great site for birders.

We were picked up at 6:30 in the morning with two others and escorted out to the lagoon, about a half hour drive north of Puerto Escondido, where we hopped on our small tour boat. When we first arrived, we were the only boat on the lagoon; as time passed a few canoes with local fishermen appeared. Our boatman guided us down a narrow mangrove channel while the tour guide Evi explained how parrots lay their eggs in large termite nests, giving the newly hatched birds termites to eat and thus have sustenance when they\\u2019re born \\u2013 smart creatures! Evi explained that this lagoon has three species of mangrove and that the trees reproduce in two ways: with long thin seedpods that go down into the water and with the hanging roots that do the same thing \\u2013 very ingenious. \\n\\nEveryone on the tour is given a good quality pair of binoculars to spot all the birds that live here. Close to one hundred different species of bird make this lagoon their home and we saw examples of about two thirds of them. Off the main lagoon, we cruised down some very narrow mangrove channels and had to duck our heads to avoid the roots and branches. In the rainy season this lagoon opens to the ocean; this makes the water brackish, a combination of fresh water from the Manialtepec River and the ocean salt water: \\u201cManialtepec\\u201d means \\u201cPlace where the waters meet\\u201d. Our guide spent quite a bit of time calling to the birds, imitating the sounds of a tiny predatory owl to disturb the other birds who did start to flutter and flock and fly around the boat. Evi told us that the sounds of the pygmy owl cause the other birds to fly around in a fright; the owl then grabs as many as he can and eats them as they scatter \\u2013 yikes! \\n\\nAfter seeing a number of birds of all kinds, we drove quietly down the river channel towards the ocean, passing, unexpectedly, horses on the lagoon side, grazing on grasses. Our tour concluded with breakfast and beer on a huge deserted beach where the family runs a cantina for incoming tour groups, of which there was one other group besides ours this morning.

You can ask around about it from the street fair in downtown PE. I think the night tours begin around 10pm. You take a cab about 10-15 min from the center of town and it drops you off at the building where an employee explains about the area, the warm, freshwater lagoon (manglades), and how it\\'s a habitat for many birds and glowfish. I\\'m not sure what they\\'d be called in English as the lecture was entirely in Spanish, but from what I understood, these microscopic plankton are like lightening bugs, and they glow a phosphorescent blue when threatened. When the water is disturbed, it glows. It is AWESOME. \\n\\n It happened to be thundering with lightening when we went (a little lightening over an open body of water is not a concern in Mexico - Safety shmafety), which made it even more awesome. Bolts of lightening illuminating the sky and fluorescent water glowing all around us as we swam. I think the guide said the best time to see this was in May. It was July. It wasn\\'t overwhelmingly luminescent, but the water definitely lit up when we moved and splashed. The water spraying from the sides of the boat glowed on the way out there. \\n\\nThe water is very shallow - ranging from about 4 to 6 feet - so don\\'t dive from the boat. You probably don\\'t want to stand, either, since the bottom is muddy and grassy. \\n\\nI can\\'t remember now how much the tour cost. It\\'s a fixed amount for the tour divided by the number of people going. We were only 3 people and I think we talked them down to about 50-60 pesos a person (it was around $5-$10), plus the cab (40 pesos).  We got a cab to take us to the launch site, then we just paid there for the boat tour. It was about 2 hours for just the 3 of us. There were about 6-10 other people in the lecture, but they went in a different boat, so we never saw another soul while we were out there. I\\'m sure if you arrange the whole tour including hotel pick up and drop off, you\\'d pay about 300 pesos a person. I never buy those rip-off tours. Always cheaper to get there yourself. Bring a towel. \\n\\nOur captain was funny and we had a good time. The only bad thing is you can\\'t take pictures. You can try, but they won\\'t turn out. Only professional cameras can capture the luminescence. Bummer. It\\'s dark out there. The boat has a single spotlight, but once the guide picks a spot, he turns it off. He has a big flashlight, though, if needed to ward off any Swamp Things.  \\n\\nHope that helps!  Enjoy Puerto Escondido!

The horses had a good constitution and well nourished (not like some horses on the beaches in Puerto Escondido which are very skinny and tired). The horses from LALO are moreover easy and safe to ride, as they had good and calm characters. We enjoyed every minute on the horse and were also highly overwhelmed of the beautiful nature. After more than an hour we arrived at the hot springs Atotonilco were we have made a stop for the time we needed. We took a bath in the hot springs and got some healthy mud for our skin. We recommend this tour to all horseback riding lovers and adventures, it is a very unique experience, especially swimming in the very hot water :-)\\n\\nThirdly we went with LALO to the Laguna Ventanilla and then to Mazunte to sea the turtles. Our guide was Eve again, as he is the only one who could speak such well English. He convinced us again with his bride knowledge of the animals and the nature. First we went with a little boat through the Laguna Ventanilla to see a lot of iguanas and different sorts of birds. Then we made a stop on a little island to see crocodiles, were we could rest and got a refreshment, fortunately, as it was very hot on that day.Afterwards we went back to the beginning and driving directly to Mazunte to see the turtles.

Lalo (of lalo ecotours) took us out on his boat. He picked us up at our hotel in PE and drove us for about 20 minutes out to the lagoon. It was just my buddy, Lalo and I on the boat, and it was an awesome experience. Lalo was very friendly and personable, his English is so-so, and my Spanish is so-so, but between the two of us we communicated quite well. The lagoon is beautiful, sporting a wide variety of bird life. Although the morning trip would probably be better for spotting wildlife. The boat tour lasted for about 3 or 4 hours, and included a stop at a beautiful palapa style bar on the beach, totally isolated from other people. During my two weeks in Oaxaca and Puerto Escondido, this excursion on the lagoon with Lalo was hands down the best part of my trip, and Lalo was one of the coolest people I met.

We enjoyed seeing dozens of different, exotic types of birds up close, including pelicans that skimmed overhead, and trees laden with birds with vast wingspans, a kaleidoscope of colors (including pink, red, yellow, orange!), and one type that oinked and grunted like angry pigs.  The 12-meter laguna can be seen by boat or by kayak and for the hearty among you we strongly recommend the kayaks, which allow you to go at your own pace, explore any bird or inlet that appeals to you, and permits you to run through the channels that local fisherman have hacked through the fascinating red mangroves ... the locals get access to the laguna and you can take a side-visit to get a long-distance peak at their rustic villages and boats.  A typical one-way kayak venture runs 2.5-3.5 hours depending on the diversions one makes ... and happily the tour includes a boat ride to return, as the one-way trip is pleasingly tiring.\\n\\nThe laguna is fed by a river that typically runs parallel to the ocean, protected by a sand bar.  The first sight of this connection from the laguna is a marvel ... there beyond the tip of your kayak lies the placid laguna and beyond that the sand bar loaded with colorful birds and beyond that the ocean with its 20-foot waves crashing in explosions and filling the horizon with foam and mist and frothy roars.  \\n\\nWe were fortunate to be there just two days after the sandbar connection to the river had been breached by Ernesto\\'s after-effects.  As a result, a new connection between the river and ocean had been made, allowing ocean fish and saltwater into the river and eventually the lagoon, and creating an outlet for fresh water.  Local fishermen tossed circle nets into the connection and hauled their catches as we watched.  And the breach will apparently fuel the phosphoric phenomenon among the algae that is so widely written about ...  the locals were excited to see what will happen at the laguna in weeks to come.

Job (not sure about the spelling), a fellow who lives at the lagoon, arrived to pick us up at 6:40 pm and we were off  to Playa Delfin (Dolphin Beach), a twenty five kilometer long beach a ways north of Escondido, to release turtles. After the turtle release, which probably took about two hours or so, we were off north again to the six kilometer long Manialtepec Lagoon, a body of water surrounded by mangrove swamp vegetation, its tropical climate lending itself to a diverse ecosystem. Dozens of migratory bird species such as herons and ducks make Manialtepec lagoon their home at various times of the year. Job told us that, in addition to birds and fish, crocodiles live here. We, and six other people, boarded the small tour boat and headed out on the cloudless night to tour the lagoon and see the phosphorescence created by the water\\u2019s phytoplankton. Beside the boat, we could see streaks of bright silver zipping hither and yon; these were fish. Running our hands through the water produced long streaks of brilliant white and silver; resting in the lagoon, our hands appeared white and skeletal because of the phosporescence. Encouraged by Job, several people jumped in and swam, their bodies making white and silver patterns in the dark \\u2013 fabulous. We were told that, in the rainy season, the area is completely dark and the falling rain makes the entire lagoon shine brilliantly against the black background. That would be amazing to see.

Pelee Wing\\'s Birding tour of the Manialtepec Lagoon given by Mike Malone ended up being one of the highlights of our trip and should not be missed when in PE.  The tour can be done by motor boat or Kayak but we opted for the Kayak tour as we hoped this quiet mode of transport would allow us to see many more birds and explore more remote areas in the mangrove lined water channels in the lagoon. Given the number of birds in the lagoon,  we would have seen plenty either way but the Kayaks really allow you to experience the Lagoon in solitude but if birds are your priority, you can\\'t go wrong with either tour. \\n\\nAfter picking  us up at our hotel, and driving to the lagoon, Mike provided great coffee as he provided an orientation of the lagoon.  As a naturalist who has been giving this tour for over 20 years, Mike\\'s knowledge really shined once we hit the water as he identified numerous interesting and diverse birds.   My personal favorite was seeing flocks of storks.  After the birding tour, we finished up on a remote beach only accessible by boat.  It was by far the most beautiful beach I have seen in Mexico.  There was nothing on the beach but a small palapa with a local family serving fantastic food and beer.  Swimming and lunch on that beach really topped off the day and will always be a special memory of our time in PE.

The tour company provided transportation for ten passengers in a very nice van.  Traveling from Pto. Escondido to the national park took about an hour, a bit longer than I had expected.  The driver drove very fast on the 2-lane road, both going and returning, and there were a few close calls with oncoming vehicles.  The actual tour was very pleasant, In a lancha with ten seats and sun shade, on a beautiful day in December.  We had no idea what to expect.  It was interesting to learn about the mangroves, the wildlife of the region, the depth of the water and the effects of tidal changes.  All of the interpretive information was given in Spanish.  Fortunately I\\'m bilingual and was able to interpret for the German- and English-speaking passengers.  Toward the end of our tour, we stopped at a village where the Mexican federal government has a project to re-populate the cocodrilo (crocodile) in various parts of the country.  There were enclosures containing three different species of crocodiles.  We had hoped to see these animals in the wild, so it was a disappointment to see them in captivity.  We were passing through a narrow channel among the dense mangroves when our idyllic experience was ruined by an idiot on a jet ski.  This guy and his girlfriend/wife went flying around our boat on the port side, creating a huge wake and spraying us with water.  One of the women in my group was drenched and her phone/camera was temporarily put out of order.  The tranquil and peaceful ambiance was destroyed by one person.  Another jet ski came along a few minutes later, but that driver was respectful and cautious, barely leaving a wake.  My opinion is that the national park should not allow jet skis on the waters of Lagunas de Chacahua.  They could take an example from the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in northern Minnesota, USA, allowing only un-motorized watercraft except for the licensed and permitted tour guides and the fishermen who make their living harvesting fish, shrimp, and clams from the laguna.  We had a nice lunch at a place on the beach, albeit with VERY slow and inattentive service.  Several of the people in our boat took advantage of the beautiful (and deserted) beach for a swim.  The boat ride back to the dock was fast and uneventful.  It would be nice if Lalo could provide bilingual guides.  But the best improvement in the entire experience would be to prohibit jet skis from the national park.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Lagunas de Chacahua Parque Nacional", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/89/6b/93/the-beach.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Puerto Escondido", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "71814", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "471875904": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Brilliant Day!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153373-d153812-Reviews-Lagunas_de_Chacahua_Parque_Nacional-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/89/6b/93/the-beach.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We took a tour with Gregorio from Pascon Tours at the Posada Real.

I am fine with hostels and shared facilities, and this is not my first experience of travelling on a budget in a developing country.\\nThat being said, I came to Chacahua for the promise of nature, beauty and tranquility, and a fellow traveller recommended this place as a special highlight of her trip, so I was pretty sold on the idea and decided it was worth the extra hassle created by the journey to get here. Now, I want to be really honest and objective for anyone like me, who us looking for a piece of heaven, off the beaten track.\\nPersonally, this place has not lived up to my expectations, and while I wouldn\\'t discourage anyone from coming here I can\\'t honestly rave about it either.\\nIt\\'s a small village set in between a pretty lagoon and a great beach, and while it does have a certain underdeveloped charm about it you should also be prepared for the accompanying features - such as woefully poor standard of accommodation, seriously limited or non existent communications (which is great for anyone who enjoys that level of isolation), and a fairly basic selection of food options. If you enjoy simple fresh fish or seafood then you will be satisfied, but be warned that you will have to contend with very persistent flies and the scourge of mosquitoes. There is no shortage of dog turds to avoid as you walk along the beach (I kept my flip flops on), and the peace and tranquility is regularly broken by motorboats (lanchas) whizzing up and down the lagoon, locals playing music loud enough for the benefit of all the immediate neighbours, and bursts of what can only be described as obnoxiously loud but thankfully short broadcasts on mounted speakers, presumably advertising current offerings of food or activities. My Spanish is not good enough to fully understand the content but having travelled extensively throughout SE Asia these outbursts brought to mind the frequent Islamic calls to prayer that everyone is made to endure in Muslim dominated areas.\\nPeople are certainly friendly and, besides surfing, there is precious little to do besides take a boat trip among the mangrove tunnels, which is pleasant but not what I would consider unmissable. The water bioluminescence that can be seen at night is certainly magical but I was not enchanted enough to stay any longer than the 2 nights I originally planned.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Lagunas de Chacahua Parque Nacional", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/89/6b/93/the-beach.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Puerto Escondido", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "71814", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "455775057": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Paradise!!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153373-d153812-Reviews-Lagunas_de_Chacahua_Parque_Nacional-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/89/6b/93/the-beach.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Where do I begin????\\n\\nTo get there, you must ride a small boat that takes you allong a mangrove maze..... \\n\\nEndless bay beach, with blue water.... to my left...\\nTo my right, a wonderfull shallow lagoon.\\nThe most welcoming and lovely people, willing to help, show, brag or patiently listen to your endless chat.\\nThe place has basic services.

Also, I\\'m going to focus on lodging and meals, which aren\\'t well covered in other TA reviews.    But first, don\\'t hesitate to take public transportation.  This is from someone who doesn\\'t speak Spanish and is a first time visitor.  You\\'ll just have to research your starting point well.  Try a visit to the bus station the day prior to get your bearings and ask questions.  Now on to lodging.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have any, don\\'t tell the colectivo driver or he\\'ll drop you off at a house to look at his or a friend\\'s room then you\\'ll have to drag your stuff to the beach/lagoon area.  Someone clearly slept in the room offered to us.  There were clothes strewn all over, sheets awry, etc but they could clean up in five minutes.  Sure.  \\n\\nWait to get off until the very last stop where there is a dirt cul-de-sac and a parallel tables (for local Saturday night games) set up in the middle.  The lagoon should be on your right and the ocean ahead.\\n\\nIf you\\'re backpacking, you will be able to set up UNDER a restaurant dining flap for free.  You will be expected to buy meals and drinks there.  I don\\'t know what your shower and toilet arrangements will be but suggest you look before committing.  It will be hot with little breeze but your stuff will be safe.  \\n\\nWe stayed in a private room.  There are two that you might be interested in.  The first is at the Restaurant de 7 mares which is at the western most end of the beach, facing the beach and not the lagoon.  If you got off at the end of the line, walk straight to the beach and the restaurant will be on your left and the rooms on the right.  We saw several older people (like us) staying there and caught a glimpse into one of the rooms, which was rudimentary but probably adequate.  I suggest this venue because the restaurant is very well kept up and has good food.  Table clothes, flowers on the table, napkins provided without asking, a hand washing area at the restaurant with soap and even a towel, and clean bathrooms that are locked and only for use of people patronizing the place.   Perhaps the rooms are treated with similar pride.\\n\\nThe other is at Restaurant Chacahua.  Turn left at Restaurant de 7 Mares and walk perhaps 10 or 15 restaurants which will be on your left.  Look for a three story building.  The other buildings are two story so you shouldn\\'t have a problem finding it.  Cast your eyes up and you\\'ll see the third story room facing the ocean.  This is where we stayed.  The best I can say about it is the view and breeze but the rest is probably typical.  The sheets and pillowcases looked used, use water sparingly or you\\'ll run out, and the toilet and shower weren\\'t clean.  We had to ask 3 times for a top sheet (which we used as a bottom sheet), soap, towels, and toilet paper and pretty much stood there the last time until we got them.  And the bathroom, well just try not to focus your eyes anywhere.  The view and breeze provided the trade off however.   And like I said, it may have been one of the better rooms in the village for all I know.  Price was $7.50 U.S. per person.  Bed was hard but what the heck.  Food was good there but after I saw the proprietor stick her finger in her mouth twice to rub a gum or toothache, we ate elsewhere.  \\n\\nChacahua is no longer the ideal it probably once was.  There are now over 3000 people living there.  There is a lot of clear cutting along the entry road.  The lagoon is over-fished and shrimp haven\\'t been there for about 2 years.  May I suggest that you pass on ordering them?  There is a lot of trash outside of the tourist area and people are poor but don\\'t hassle you selling stuff.  The positives are the beautiful beach, good swimming and surf, the lagoon, luminescent algae, and the peace and quiet.  You truly just lose yourself there.  \\n\\nFor amenities, bring a travel pillow or stuff sack to use as one, hand and face towel, a flashlight (yes, we too lost power), and small bills.  No 500 peso notes.  Change is an issue.  Also bring a positive attitude and a willingness to overlook a trickle for a shower, dirty toilets, and a sink that looks like it may fall off the wall.  To many people here, these would be wonderful to have.  Ask to see several rooms and be prepared to walk if you don\\'t like what you see.

We went numerous times during our month long visit and highly recommend the location.  In addition to the beach, there are two beach clubs.  \\n\\nWe prefer, and recommend, Club Villasol.  Entry fee is 200 pesos per person but this goes towards anything you eat or drink during the day.  There\\'s are two pools, a pool bar, lots of beach and pool chairs, good umbrellas for shade, nice bathrooms, a really good beach menu, a large expanse of shallow pool for infants, an adjacent restaurant where you can work off your 200 pesos if you\\'d prefer, and immediate access to the beach.  This is good for a walk or, if you walk to the left as you face the ocean, a swim on the public beach by the second club that is somewhat protected by rocks against the waves and undertow.  I was careful in joining the twenty or so people already swimming and spent over a confident hour splashing around.  Just check the conditions against your ability before you jump in.\\n\\nYou won\\'t have any trouble working off your entry fee.  The menu is surprisingly good.  Try the ceviche, the chicken skewers, or the stuffed avocado.  All good and reasonably priced.  For better availability of the best beach/pool chairs, go early or avoid the weekends.\\n\\nOn to Club Coco, which I don\\'t recommend.  You either have to either pay 175 pesos each as a cover charge with food and drinks ON TOP of that, or pay 450 pesos each that covers food or drink.  Yep, 450 pesos - 900 for two people.  Re-read the charge above at Club Villasol and wonder why anyone would go to Club Coco to begin with.  Unfortunately, due to a misunderstanding at the desk, we paid the 175 pesos each thinking we\\'d work off the amount with food and drink.  We were very upset to find this not the case.  Totally our error due to poor Spanish but I do wish they\\'d been more explicit in stating their exclusions.  Left us with a bad taste.\\n\\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy the review and the range of beach options available to you at Playa Bacocho.

The seas were calm and the weather fair.  Our first day featured several hook-ups for sailfish with one to the boat and released after photos.  That day we thought our dolphin experience was as good as it could get.  The second day the dolphins were absolutely amazing, far exceeding the first day.  Both days we also saw several turtles.  On day 2 we boated and kept a very nice sailfish and had a few others on.  Two spectacular days on the water.  Our guides have a new boat and a new business.  You won\\'t go wrong with these 2 guys and their boat the Dorothea.  The great thing about their boat is a large sunshade which keeps everyone cool and comfortable.  That was the main reason we chose these guys and we were very happy we did.

We paid 400 pesos per hour (4 hour minimum) last February for a 5 hour trip for 4 of us (so about $185 US total plus a nice tip).  We boated 3 dorado, all right at 45 lbs and caught and released 3 sailfish.  The previous week we went out for 4 hours and caught 1 nice dorado of around 25 lbs.  We were skunked on only 1 trip out with him in February 2010, but at that time there was not any good bluewater to be found.\\n\\nAnother good point of fishing there is you typically only go 5 to 10 miles offshore...and sometimes not that to find fish...and usually get to see 2 or 3 species of dolphins, dozens of Olive-Ridleys sea turtles, offshore sea birds...if you are into such things (I am as a biologist).\\n\\nTo get hold of Chon go to Playa Carrazalillo where his wife runs a small restaurant and ask around for him or his email is:  chon.mar@hotmail.com.

Pick a restaurant, plunk yourself down in a shaded beach chair, and you have a place for the day, as long as you purchase some food or drink. They will watch your stuff while you swim or snorkel, or take a boat tour to see dolphins and turtles. The little bay there is always calm, although when we were there in March high waves in the Puerto Escondido area made the water murky for snorkeling. We got there about 11:00 a.m. on a Wednesday, and Angelito only had a half dozen or so people there. By 3:00 it was busier, but not at all crowded. The food and drink prices were reasonable, probably because there is so much competition. The restaurant owners keep the beach pretty clean, and there are big signs insisting that people clean up after their dogs. It\\'s cleaner than it was the times I went there 30 years ago. It is a lovely place to while away a day swimming, snorkeling, eating tasty Mexican food and drinking icy cervezas, watching pelicans, and looking at the view.

Perhaps it is a genetic fault or I was badly sunburnt in a former life. Until I came to Playa Zicatela.\\n\\nZicatela is a longish beach about 4 kilometres. On the town end it butts up to the Playa Principal, the main town beach for Puerto Escondido (PE). \\n\\nAs you head away from town there is the Avenida del Morro, it is full of smaller, older hotels, no Hiltons, Red Roofs, or Marriotts because, at least, PE is still a Mexican town. Morro has beachside restaurants. Eating breakfast at one I saw whale feeding offshore. I understand it can be a bit loud at night but the area seemed ok to me. \\n\\nAs you walk farther the building along the beach are a mix of simple homes, hostals, half built grey concrete apartments, mutistory homes in white and dogs. There are a lot of dogs on the beach. Most of the time this might be of concern but these guys are really laid back canines. It is sad that there are so many strays but no one bothers you and they go about surviving and playing. Farther back from the beach are hotels like the Casamar where I stayed. \\n\\nAs you walk on the sand the type of people you see starts to change. There Still older couple, men and women walking ther dogs, bodies stretched out to brown, but the closer you get to La Punta the beach\\u2019s terminus you see the surfers, volleyballers, seekers of zen states, and sunset watchers ridiculously healthy, fit, tanned people who look very content and happy. \\n\\nIt made me think about what I liked most about PE.  I decided it was the possibility that the because absolute stratification of resort towns was less pronounced it seemed real to me. I can watch surfers, drink my Victoria cerveza oscura as I watch pelicans coexist with sunbathers on the beach, see a truck full of with soldiers following two police cars which drive sedately with no sense of urgency that automatic weapons usually bring to a situation. \\n\\nOr I could go to the older middle class reverse image of La Punta in the Rinconada near the Playa Carrizalillo. But even there, besides the everpresence mucho perros, I was open to the still laid back, white wine fueled calmness and enjoyment of the moment.

The restaurants all have excellent seating for dining in the cool, breezy shade of the restaurant proper. In the sand in front of these restaurants are tables and chairs with colorful umbrellas, canopy covered beds and comfortable pillow laden couches. Closer to the ocean these places feature chaise lounges with umbrellas and small tables for drinks and food. No matter where you sit, a waiter or waitress will come with a menu ready to take your order. The high tides sweep the beach clean every night but the beach is free of litter along length and width. We\\u2019ve seen no man made trash in any form on the beach. On your walks along the beach you will see plenty of pelicans and other sea birds. You will see fisherman with nets, reels and rods. My favorite was a young man that fished from his surf board.

Be super careful in the water because on the southern end of this beach, as well as a little north in Bacocho, as well as the river at La Barra, crocodiles have been coming up on the beach.  Several people have been bitten badly.  Especially do not go in the water at La Barra.  This is an unusual happening but it is happening so just be aware.  Friendly locals have told me the story and you should know this too.  This is no joke.  Do not let this keep you away from this great beach spot, because it is a real gem.

We like to take early morning walks along the different beaches in the Puerto Escondido area. One of our favorite walks is along the surf beach at Zicatela. At the time of year that we were there, the surf and the pipeline that is formed is not very large. There are still many surfers out on the water having fun. The surfers and boggy boarders put on a very interesting show. The beach is easy to walk on and you can walk for over an hour without running out of beach. I suggest going for walks between 07:00 and 10:00 AM.. After ten o\\'clock, in my opinion it gets too hot. There are many restaurants along the north end of the beach and if you need shade and a drink they are available. I suggest that if you are going for a long walk that you bring water with you. Zicatela also has many hotels, bars, restaurants, and shops along the north end of the beach. \\n\\nThere are people walking or jogging along the beach all the time in the morning. People are very friendly and easy to talk too. It is easy to spot the visitors to Puerto Escondido on the beach, they are the people who, for the most part do not have good tans. A warning for Canadian visitor who like to talk about the weather, in Puerto Escondido the weather at this time of year is always the same, hot and sunny; so there is nothing to talk about. Sometimes when you go for walks on the Puerto Escondido beaches you will see whales, and dolphins close to shore. Sometimes there are a lot of dolphins. Plays Zicatela is a wonderful place to visit and enjoy. I highly recommend it, especially the early morning walks.\\n\\nRick Banks", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa Zicatela", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/26/52/32/view-from-hotel-ines.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Puerto Escondido", "addressRegion": "Southern Mexico", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "153977216": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Neverending sand and ocean", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153373-d153559-Reviews-Playa_Zicatela-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/26/52/32/view-from-hotel-ines.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The beach is a looong strip of sand and fantastic, gigantic, overwhelming waves.

The taxi\\'s are waiting outside the gate knowing you don\\'t plan on paying airport prices. The airport is small and you can see the entrance gate, there is only one way out and there is a sidewalk that takes you there.  Yes it may be a long taxi ride but well worth the trip because you are escaping traditional tourist areas and arrving in a place with great food, slow paced, and beautiful beaches.

The taxi\\'s know the way be prepared for steps going to the beach.\\nThey have a market in town that is best on Wednesdays and Saturdays.It has local food, fresh meats and seafood, and a flea market.  Go to the main highway thru town and catch the trucks with the white covers on them that say Mercado, it costs 8 peso\\'s each way.  You will need to know some Spanish to survive here and will also need to know how to exchange money for goods. That also means talking money lingo because they will rip you off if you don\\'t know how to speak money language.
