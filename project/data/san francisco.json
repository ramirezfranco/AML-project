So nice to see people caring about the earth and natural surroundings. it was an easy pick up in San Pancho and only 10 minutes up the road through a bush trail. Being from northern Ontario this was an easy ride for us and the trail was an easy 1km.  No problem for my grandson who is five. I would definitely recommend this tour for anyone in the area. Was the quiet I needed since I love being close to nature and just the noise from the figs dropping from the trees, birds etc. Thank you all for the hard work and pride put in to such a beautiful area!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Lo de Perla Jungle Garden", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/70/37/42/lo-de-perla-jungle-garden.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av.

You\\'ll learn about the ways in which orchids live, propagate and eventually die. You\\'ll see fig trees that - for decades - have grown up and enclosed palm trees. In winter (Dec., Jan., Feb.) the orchids send out the shoots that will open as blooms in April and May, lighting up the trails with thousands of delicate flowers that emit wonderful scents. In this nature preserve you can still see flora that has vanished from other areas of Nayarit. Clearly, creating and maintaining this amazing jungle paradise has been a labor of love for Alejandro and his helpers. They have created a haven for native flora and fauna. The tour appears challenging, but it is very doable because all paths are solid under foot and well-maintained. The tour also incorporates rest areas.

If you are at all into gardening and flowers, this is the trip for you.  Crystal has been our guide on both trips and she is so very knowledgeable about all of the trees and plants and you absorb interesting little tidbits of information that stick with you.  The jungle tour is wonderful and interesting but for me, the highlight was the orchid greenhouse.  I had never been particularly fussy about orchids but my opinion was turned upside down after being in the greenhouse.  Did you know that some orchids have a gorgeous scent?  Their colours are amazing, everything from snowy white to brilliant orange and brilliant yellow.  The bloom time for most of the outside orchids is April/May (I think), I will be going back again towards the end of April to see the outside orchids in their full glory.  Both times I have been we have seen various types of orchids in bloom along the paths.  In the greenhouse they range from very small, less than an inch, probably closer to half an inch, to massive flowers four or five, or more, inches across.

San Pancho, on the other hand, is small, funky, fun, affordable, and safe...plus the beach is clean and safe for swimming and surfing. It boasts some incredibly delicious restaurants and cute shops. We also like the size of the town...over time as we got to know people we kept running into our new friends, which turned into group meals and hang-outs. The locals (both Mexican and the gringos) are all super friendly and we just loved the people and the town!\\n\\nKeep in mind that the beach has powerful waves and is not good for small children for swimming...if you are looking for more of a calm beach, I recommend Lo de Marcos, which is the next town up the coast. There are also no lifeguards at this beach or Lo de Marcos (there is one at Sayulita but until they fix their sewage problem DO NOT GO SWIMMING OR SURFING THERE...you\\'ll get sick!).

They have an all day catamaran trip to the Mariettas. It includes snorkeling, paddle boarding, food and all you can drink. They have a diving platform off the back of the boat that is a lot of fun. They have other tours too.\\n\\nNativa Surf Shop - San Pancho.  I took my first surfing lesson from them. We did an excursion to La Lancha beach.  They also sell clothing and surfing gear.\\n\\nLa Loncheria Chuyita San Pancho - a great spot for breakfast and lunch.\\n\\nThere is an Italian restaurant called Dulce Amore at the corner of Tercer Mundo and American Latina that we like a lot. Look for a turquoise wall and signs that say &quot;Lasagna&quot; and &quot;Pasta.&quot; They have a gelato shop too. La Toscana is also a place we like a lot for Italian.\\n\\nThere also is a large ice cream shop that has excellent fruit drinks\\n\\nWe also have enjoyed a lot of the other larger well known restaurants in town... Barracuda, Mr. Ribs, Maria\\'s, La Ola Rica\\'s.\\n\\nThere are some organic restaurants too. Bistro Organico &amp; Cafe Paraiso are two that we like.\\n\\nThere is a restaurant called Mar Plata that is at the north end of the beach about a half mile from town.
