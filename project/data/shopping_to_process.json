After exiting the building follow the signage to get to Revolution Avenue. It will be about a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) walk to the Tijuana Arch landmark and Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n. If you get lost, use this landmark to get your bearings. Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n is maybe a 6 \u2013 7 block stretch where the \u201caction\u201d is.

The washroom facilities in the building that houses McDonald\u2019s is a pay facility. \u2022 Check various websites for additional information\n    \u2022 After our trip to Tijuana, we went to Las Americas shopping outlet in San Ysidro.

Its a great place to just walk around for an hour or two, and then go get some really authentic Mexican food in the center of the Mercado. Warning- like all markets, they are there to sell you stuff.

Sanborn is a high end, Mexican chain store which is part department store, newsstand and high end electronics shop. Sanborn also hosts a sit down restaurant with a good buffet which is a good place to grab lunch or dinner. A true joy and great value is the Cinepolis Movie theatre on the second floor.

I greatly enjoyed the ComicX restaurant, which is a hamburger restaurant styled on the characters from Marvel and DC Comic books and is similar to Planet Hollywood.

Here you will find the best selections of books in English and Spanish for the whole family.

Formerly Cholla Mall was a &quot;captive audience&quot; situation as all ATV traffic going to Cholla Bay or to the dunes and back was funneled through here. Business has dropped off in the last few years here but it should be improved in a couple weeks by completion of a new paved road that ties into Hotel Row better than in the past. Parking is around back of the &quot;storefronts&quot; and the shops are best inspected on foot.
