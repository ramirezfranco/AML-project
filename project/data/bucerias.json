Below is a list of &quot;why&quot; we kept coming back even after trying some others stores:\\n\\n1. Location: if you are staying at the north end of Nuevo Vallarta then this is one of the two closest commercial grocery stores (similar to our Canadian Superstore).  It is approx. a 20-30 minute walk from the Acqua/Aria Condos, or Riu\\'s/Samba hotels. There is also a new grocery store right beside it - also large - and called La Comer.  I believe it specializes in different things, but I heard prices were a little more (however, I cannot personally confirm - we stuck to what we knew because I dislike having to &quot;find&quot; things again in a new grocery store!) \\n\\n2.  Selection: you name it they have it ... I even found &quot;ground&quot; chia seeds in the &quot;specialty&quot; section. Along with regular grocery store items they sell things like beach toys, chairs, coolers, suntan lotion, swimsuits, beach towels, clothes, electronics, batteries, pots, pans, brooms, buckets, dishes etc., and have a large Pharmacy with a cosmetic section. (N.B. they are also attached to a mall with a Scotia Bank with an instant teller that we used without issue when taking out $$ - we don\\'t use the ones just outside the grocery store).  The Mall also has a Chiropractor and a number of other clothing shops.   A number of the Mega staff speak English, but not all.  Cashiers have limited English, but we really never had a problem and I would also note that during the snowbird season 90% of the people shopping there speak English and are only too happy to help out (or just use Google translate on your phone).\\n\\n3.  Spirits;  Ok they have a very LARGE selection of alcoholic products... one whole row is devoted to beer.... most liquor/beer is cheap... we found a few pricey imports (e.g., Gin &amp; Rye - I bought my Bombay Gin at the duty free on the flight there and recall being  glad I did ...otherwise, things like Beer, Rum, Vodka, Kahluha are VERY cheap... wines it depends... they often have a special on Concha y Toro Reservado red/white wines which are surprisingly very good and around 8$ Canadian ... sometimes they offer two for one or buy one get one for 50% off ... during the time we were there was always some sort of sale.  To give you an idea of cost a 40 oz. of Rum/Vodka sold for around $12-13 Canadian  (yes you heard me right)... Beer was on average a 1.50 (e.g. Tecate)... Corona was I believe around the same &amp; give or take a few cents depending on the brand.  Kahlua was 12$ Cdn for a 40 oz bottle (I know unbelievable!).  I also bought my Kahlua at Mega before going going back to Canada and they had a special - buy one Liquor at the reg. price and get one ar 50% so for 2 - 40 oz bottles of Kahlua it cost me under 20$ Canadian!! (No misprint!). The airport duty-free was A LOT more N.B. just remember if you buy it in the grocery store it has to go in your suitcase (NOT carry on) when you take it home - watch your weight - any luggage over 50 lbs starts costing you big time at the airport)  I believe a bottle of Kahlua weighs approx. 8 lbs. - so best to bring a small digital scale to check your luggage before you head home.\\n\\n4.  Prices:  loose vegetables and fruit are super cheap in Mexico.   I had to look twice because I could not believe how cheap; most are priced by the KILO!  I think I paid around $4.00 this winter at Superstore for one very large orange pepper... In Mexico an orange pepper was .59 cents a KILO... Meats are little more if you like North american style cuts.  Chicken is cheap, fish is cheap.  They have a red meat called Arracherra ... which is very good ... pre-seasoned ... kind of like a small roast - very nice!!\\n\\n5.  Taxis:  Obviously you won\\'t be walking home with a load of groceries.  Taxis are always at the main entrance and all drivers speak decent English ... at the time of writing (early 2018) a taxi back to the Riu\\'s, Acqua/Aria, or Samba area was 85 pesos or approx $6.00 Cdn.\\n\\nHope this helps a bit!!!  Happy Snowbirding!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Mega Comercial Mexicana", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/76/99/f1/mega-parking-lot.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Club Residencial, Flamingos Carretera Tepic - Puerto Vallarta, 1297, Flamingos Nuevo Vallarta, Bucerias, Nayarit, Mexico", "addressLocality": "Bucerias", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "63732", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "567337352": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Everything you want", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g657267-d10353389-Reviews-Mega_Comercial_Mexicana-Bucerias_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/76/99/f1/mega-parking-lot.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Mega is the location Linda and I visit when we vacation in Mexico.

W visited the Bucerias Mega (just down the highway from Bucerias) in December 2017. \\n\\n.. Its worth a trip as its a definite \\'non touristy\\' thing to do! Thank you to Senora Martha for bagging our groceries and helping us find an item.

Smaller children (less than age 7) had more difficulty navigating the waves (between 6-8 feet) to even swim out to the float and had to be brought out by lifeguards. The parts are abundant and somewhat securely fastened - again windy enough on our day to be velcroing apart. The bottom of the wibit apparatus did seem slimy and may have had barnacles from being in the salt water continuously. The gentleman that seems to be the owner/operator that took our payment was helpful in sizing us up for the mandatory life jackets. He seems to reiterate that there were four lifeguards out there to help today making is seems more unusual than standard.

In addition, the property has lots of unique nooks and crannies for BBQ\\'s, sporting activities, spa facility, or areas to meditate.  The pool is large with a &quot;U&quot; shape design.  On Sunday a band sets up a stage in the &quot;island&quot; formed by the &quot;U&quot;.  Also on Sunday, the chef prepares a special meal.  Our meal for two consisted of three chile rellenos, one filled with cheese, one beef, and one shrimp - delicious.  In addition, you get two glasses of wine.  Priced at $230 pesos.  If you are staying for a period of time there are organized activities to take part in.

The only caution is the road going in: it\\'s in pretty rough shape, but workers were already putting down new gravel while we were there, so I doubt that will be an ongoing problem. There are also some renovations going on at the sanctuary itself, so it will likely be even better when we come back next year.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Santuario de Cocodrilos El Cora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/15/c2/25/63/el-cora-es-el-mejor-lugar.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera Puerto Vallarta-Tepic s/n Laguna El Quelele", "addressLocality": "Bucerias", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "63732", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "633235114": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Incredible!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g657267-d4345629-Reviews-Santuario_de_Cocodrilos_El_Cora-Bucerias_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/15/c2/25/63/el-cora-es-el-mejor-lugar.jpg", "datePublished": "November 13, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Reuben and Hector were incredible!

This will come with warnings to anyone who is thinking of going, so be prepared.  After a frustrating try at using Uber, we decided to just grab a taxi.  It was only maybe 3 km from where we were staying so we got into a cab.  Getting off the main road (200), we followed some scant signage and drove maybe a kilometer or two down a really bumpy road through the jungle.  Good thing it was the dry season and you\\'d probably get stuck on this road if it was wet.  The taxi driver wasn\\'t impressed but of good humour as I kept apologizing for the road, like it was my fault, lol.  Got to an arrow pointing left so we assumed we were going in the right direction.  When we got there, we found out it had tour times and we had to wait maybe 20 or 30 minutes.  There was another taxi driver there waiting for his fair to finish their tour because you can\\'t call a taxi to come get you from there..they don\\'t come pick you up at this place!!!!  In other words, if you come in a taxi, the driver has to wait for you and this will take an hour! Luckily, our taxi driver was at the end of his shift so he just had to call into dispatch and let them know he\\'d be another hour or so bringing the cab back.  He was lovely and didn\\'t mind waiting in their nice shady hut and of course I told him he\\'d be getting a nice tip and the 6 pack of beer I had in my fridge at the end of it, lol.  He seemed happy with that!  Oh, and he only charged us for the ride there and back, not for waiting.  We told him we\\'d be happy to bring him on the tour but he said he was fine and didn\\'t like crocodiles that much anyway, lol.  So, this is a sanctuary where they rescue injured crocodiles mostly and an assortment of other animals like parrots and goats, etc. who could not survive in the wild.  I know that seems weird to many people in Mexico as there are so many crocodiles there and not looked upon with affection!  It was high tide so we didn\\'t see any swimming around but did get to visit ones that were on land, even going into one of the pens with one (I kept a little distance!).  The guide was very informative and the price was reasonable (200 peso\\'s each) and plus we liked the fact that the money was going to a good cause.  It\\'s not a showy attraction if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for but enjoyable and informative, plus we did get to hold a baby crocodile and got some good pictures.  Just go prepared regarding the ride there and back and know that even though it says it\\'s open at 11:00, you will be going on a tour which is timed so you may have to wait a few minutes or even up to an hour if you just missed the tour ahead of you.  Our tour began at 1:00 and it was a Sunday afternoon with only 3 of us there.  No need for me to go back but it\\'s a cool thing to experience and for a good cause.

The entrance to the refuge is just south of the Flamingos Golf Course, you\\u2019ll see the large golf ball on a tee; the small sign indicating the road to the refuge is just south of that. There is a winding, bumpy, occasionally submerged (in the wet season) dirt road that leads in to the refuge about 2 km from the main road. We took a taxi from the Royal Decameron resort in Bucerias to the refuge for 200 Pesos. The driver had been there before, but didn\\u2019t appear too happy about making the journey. However, for another 200 Pesos for the return trip he was willing to come back and pick us up after a couple of hours. One note: the refuge doesn\\u2019t open until 11:00, we had gotten there too early and had to kill some time bird-watching , which was actually a bonus as the wetlands around the refuge site are loaded with birds. We were later told that it\\u2019s best to time your visit with low tide as the mud flats that become exposed are a magnet for birds of all sorts.\\n\\nIt costs 200 Pesos per person to enter the refuge, but it is well worth it. You will get a close-up experience with the American Crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus) and other local wildlife.

It was our first time to do this. It was a still night with no breeze but otherwise a pleasant walk. Several of the &quot; higher end &quot; stores remain open and the streets and nooks have vendors of many sorts. Our friends bought some candy from a street cart. Some places set up outside tables ( as do food establishments each night ) to have a glass of wine. Sampling of a few wines was available. Jewelry and paintings seems to be the most common items for sale. There was hardly any solicitation by the vendors that night differing from walking through the markets on a daily basis. I would wander through the walk again. But I wasn\\'t really walking through to buy. I mainly wanted to be exposed to the talents and flavor of the true artists. The ones that come from many places to live and work in Bucerias. The nights of walking through the streets is special in Bucerias.  Often families are home and their front door is open offering a glimpse of their lives we don\\'t see in the day. Family sits outside on the side walk and children play. A great sampling of &quot;local color&quot; beyond the artist\\'s paint brush.

The cobble stone streets are lined with authentic old pueblos.. housing great art galleries, wonderful unique gift shops and cheap chic restaurants.  Lots of places to take classes - glass blowing, mosaics, mexican cookery/cuisine.  Wonderful restaurants, and coffee shops (check out all the other tips)\\nThis area is east over the foot bridge from the flea market.  Or West from Royal DeCameron resort before getting to the foot bridge.  Many tourists don\\'t find it because they are too busy looking at the main Bucerias street and flea market.!\\nI actually did a great mosaic class at &quot;Broken Art&quot;.... It was also the first day of spring and there was street parade - all the children dressed up and vehicles decorated with flowers.\\nThe main area of Bucerias is lovely too, with a lovely square lined with food vendors and as well as jewellry and crafts.  The area has really grown in the past 5 years and there are more hotels and restaurants lining the gorgeous beach.\\nBucerias is easy to get to by bus.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "The Bucerias Art Walk", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/6e/60/df/filename-dsc03807-jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "62 Lazaro Cardenas", "addressLocality": "Bucerias", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "125573454": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Walk to Bucerias", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g657267-d5039362-Reviews-The_Bucerias_Art_Walk-Bucerias_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/6e/60/df/filename-dsc03807-jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Interesting stops to look at art and craftwork on the way to the Bucerias market.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "The Bucerias Art Walk", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/6e/60/df/filename-dsc03807-jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "62 Lazaro Cardenas", "addressLocality": "Bucerias", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "124719828": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "What an enjoyable evening walking off a great dinner!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g657267-d5039362-Reviews-The_Bucerias_Art_Walk-Bucerias_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/6e/60/df/filename-dsc03807-jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Never knew there is an annual art walk.
