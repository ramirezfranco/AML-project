There are great food locals and restaurants all over the stadium. The first time I went I was shocked and overwhelmed by the beauty and the size of this place. It seemed crazy as if it was from another country, due to the quality of it all and the feel you get when you go inside it. Here in Culiacan, Sinaloa, baseball is one of the most famous and enjoyable sports, people love to go see their home team play and win, therefore you will never get bored while visiting this place. Also if you ever get hungry while visiting, there is a wide variety of great quality food to enjoy, you can go from munching on some delicious tacos to having dinner at a fancy delicious sushi restaurant. I believe that the design of the new stadium contributes to all of these things, likewise I believe that the gesture of putting the numbers of the jerseys of past members of the club outside the stadium is really cool and caring. You can see that they were really loved and that they\\u2019re missed by the people. You can see there has been a great upgrade from the past stadium and it\\u2019s obvious that it took many hours to design and accomplish. It\\u2019s also capable of receiving more people and holding more up- level games. In general, the atmosphere is also more diverse and fun. So if you want to have a good time, a good laugh and a good meal this is definitely a place you won\\u2019t get disappointed at. \\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Estadio Tomateros", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/11/d9/4f/5c/nuevo-estadio-tomateros.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Jesus Andrade S/N Miguel Aleman", "addressLocality": "Culiacan", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "80200", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Plaza_Paseo_San_Isidro-Culiacan_Pacific_Coast": {"570693028": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A good place to spend your day.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150781-d12289330-Reviews-Plaza_Paseo_San_Isidro-Culiacan_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/branding/rebrand/TA_brand_logo.png", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "It\\'s a huge place with Cin\\u00e9polis, food court, supermarket and a lot of other shop were you can find clothes, makeup, ice cream, shoes, etc. A family place.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Plaza Paseo San Isidro", "image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/branding/rebrand/TA_brand_logo.png", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1787, Blvd. Paseo DE Los Ganaderos Plaza", "addressLocality": "Culiacan", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "80197", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "538602756": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Very nice and family friendly atmosphere.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150781-d12289330-Reviews-Plaza_Paseo_San_Isidro-Culiacan_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/branding/rebrand/TA_brand_logo.png", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "It\\'s quite a nice place, I really enjoyed my visit, the movie theater there is my favorite, as it\\'s very comfortable and cheap.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Plaza Paseo San Isidro", "image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/branding/rebrand/TA_brand_logo.png", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "1787, Blvd. Paseo DE Los Ganaderos Plaza", "addressLocality": "Culiacan", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "80197", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "501383079": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "If you want to have a great time.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150781-d12289330-Reviews-Plaza_Paseo_San_Isidro-Culiacan_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/branding/rebrand/TA_brand_logo.png", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "If you want to have a great time, you must go to PLAZA SAN ISIDRO.

It is one, because it\\u00b4s a public space where different activities to promote a culture of respect and rational use of our natural resources. Also, there once was a man, who had an incredible collection of plants and were the engineer of the construction of the botanical garden, his name was Carlos Murrillo Depraect. He made the creation of the garden, a reality. \\nIn addition, another amazing fact about this place it is the big collection of art it has. Art pieces from more than 10 different artists, such as Gabriel Orozco, Richard Long, Francis Al\\u00ffs and more. Nevertheless, there are two things that personally I loved about this beautiful and magic garden. One, it is practically forced to visit all of it, because if not, people can get lost, well the garden looks like a labyrinth. Two, whenever people are walking around the place, they can feel so pure and loose, because a lot of nature make feel more clean air. All my life I have live in Culiacan and there is no nature place I love more that the botanical garden, as so I said before for me it is so relaxing, pure, magic and beautiful.

The prettiest type of flowers that I saw were the aquatic flowers, they had gorgeous colors and they were part of a project that represented the importance of taking care of the marine species.

I think they could do a better job in keeping the animals in good conditions by giving the animals the attention they need. The authorities definitely have to move the facilities to a bigger place so the animals can live in a bigger place where they can run and walk freely and not just in circles. The animals deserve to have medical attention, food and liberty. I am so disappointed with the fact that the government do not give enough importance to something like this.

Another factor that I did not like was that they were doing repairs at that time, being the hour where there are more people, I don\\u2019t think it was necessary. And finally, above all, what I hate the most was the smell in some parts. I would like to say that this does not come from animals, I\\'m sure how animals smell. However, that place stinks.

Besides the aviary there were other points where the zoo leave the visitor with a bad taste in the mouth, all the animals looked sad and there were cages without animals and the reptiliary was closed and for what I know it has been closed since the start of the year, the costs of the food are very expensive and that makes very difficult to families to afford the complete joy of the trip. In the good side of the thinks if you go to the zoo with your family at the weekend you can have a good time, the entrance cost is cheap being 25 pesos the cost for kids and 30 pesos the cost for adults, you can see the animals and if you are a little kid the animals will amaze you with their majesty.

In addition, you can see animals dirty, a notice for employees &quot;you need to clean the animals&quot;, specially monkey\\u00b4s cage because it smells like sewer and to be worse you can see poop in the floor.\\nFinally, the structure is too weak. When my friends and I went to the aviary, the floor was made of woods, but these woods were in bad conditions so you could hear the crunch of wood and there was an announcement of &quot;Be careful where you step&quot;. Instead of fixing the problem, they just wait to see what happen.\\nIn conclusion, Culiacan Zoo has to many things to improve, but it needs to start right now to reborn as the good zoo it used to be.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zoologico Culiacan", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/1e/f2/6a/zoologico-de-culiacan.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Rafael Buelna Tenorio 855", "addressLocality": "Culiacan", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "80000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "631016468": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Animal\\u00b4s life", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150781-d8143653-Reviews-Zoologico_Culiacan-Culiacan_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/1e/f2/6a/zoologico-de-culiacan.jpg", "datePublished": "November 5, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The zoo is a good place to be with your Friends and family, there are a lot of fun activities to do, but the real problem is the animals and how they live, they have very poor conditions and their cages are so small, they are not clean and their water supplies are not completely clean. some animals escaped from their cages when i went there, two pigs were walking around the zoo, and they were afraid of the humans.\\nThe installations were not completely in place, the zoo looked like if it was abandoned. The restrooms doors could not close, the food court was horrible and the cages of the animals were all dirty. Some animals did not have clean water and they looked so sad, some other animals looked so slim, like if they did not had a single food in days.Also The zoo was so dirty that there was poop in the floor, even a dead lizard that we almost stepped on.\\nThe zoo was in horrible conditions, i would not recommend too much to go and spend a nice time there, because it is empty and dirty, some parts of the zoo smelled so bad, and the animals were so dirty so they smelled bad. Before the zoo was a good place and had it\\u00b4s areas more clean, they were a lot more animals and they were in better conditions, that is why the zoo nowadays is not a good place to visit in culiacan.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zoologico Culiacan", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/1e/f2/6a/zoologico-de-culiacan.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Rafael Buelna Tenorio 855", "addressLocality": "Culiacan", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "80000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "631016334": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A place that you have to visit", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150781-d8143653-Reviews-Zoologico_Culiacan-Culiacan_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/1e/f2/6a/zoologico-de-culiacan.jpg", "datePublished": "November 5, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "There are many places in Culiacan that you can visit, like Catedral, La lomita, Parque las riberas, among others, but the zoo is special. A zoo is a place where you can see animals of any type and Culiacan has one. This is located in Calle Gral Rafael Buelna Tenorio 855, Las Quintas. But why is the zoo the best place to visit in Culiacan, In my opinion, visiting the zoo can be a great experience for people and more if you go as a family, there you can see many animals and you can see them from nearby and even touch them. This zoo is very special because despite seeing the animals and all that, it is very well maintained, there are food reels, it is very well where the animals live and the decoration is great. Also going with your friends can be a great experience because you can take pictures with animals, you can spend all day there without getting bored, there are also signs outside the cages of animals that describe exactly what kind of animal it is and also how it is their behavior. Something that I also like about the zoo is the entrance, it has the letters of zoo on a giant wall of stone, they are blue, black and orange and it makes it a very interesting and beautiful entrance. It also has a bridge that connects the riverside park and makes it special. Besides the zoo is very cheap, they only charge 30 pesos per adult and 25 per children. the zoooligo is an essential place to have fun with friends and family and you can learn a lot from the fauna of the world.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zoologico Culiacan", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/1e/f2/6a/zoologico-de-culiacan.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Rafael Buelna Tenorio 855", "addressLocality": "Culiacan", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "80000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "630996290": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Culiacan\\u00b4s Zoo", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150781-d8143653-Reviews-Zoologico_Culiacan-Culiacan_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/1e/f2/6a/zoologico-de-culiacan.jpg", "datePublished": "November 5, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "If you are planning to visit Culiacan, you probably would want some activities to do. &quot;El Zoologico de Culiacan&quot; is one of the best places to visit with your family, it has one of the biggest aviaries in America, containing lots of birds that you can feed and take photos with. There are a lot of different species, from lions and jaguars, to turtles and giraffes. If you get tired of walking, there is a little shop where you can buy food and drinks. If you are visiting with your whole family, there is even a zone where there are some sea lions. There is also a reptile zone, where you can see a variety of snakes and lizards When you are done visiting the zoo you can easily move to &quot;Parque Las Rivera\\u2019s&quot;, there is a bridge that will get you there and you\\u00b4ll be able to do some shopping or even watch a movie. In any case, the zoo is a perfect place to visit alone, or with your family, so I would highly recommend it to anyone who visits Culiacan, especially if you have kids, they would be amazed with the variety of species in the zoo.
