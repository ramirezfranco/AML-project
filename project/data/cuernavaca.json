If you are a history buff, it\\'s thrilling to walk around a building that dates back to the 1550s and belonged to Hern\\u00e1n Cort\\u00e9s. Regardless of what you think about the man\\'s role in the conquest of Mexico, it\\'s interesting to see how the Spanish lived in the 16th century, and how this place functioned as a fortress when they were conquering the surrounding area.  Mexico doesn\\'t glorify Cort\\u00e9s or the Spanish in general, but it does recognize the importance of their architecture, so the government turned this fantastic building into a regional history museum. Many of the exhibits deal with the pre-colombian civilizations that inhabited the area, but there are also some interesting displays from the colonial period and 19th century.  The murals by Diego Rivera are fascinating.  The museum isn\\'t large and won\\'t take more than an hour to see, even if you go at a very leisurely pace. It makes a nice break in the day to go inside the museum and get out of the sun and noise of downtown Cuernavaca. Closed on Monday, like all museums in Mexico. Centrally located, right across from the z\\u00f3calo. Check out the craft market next to the palace, it\\'s a good place to buy souvenirs.

From DF, Cuernavaca is an easy day trip by first class bus from the Terminal Sur. Due to Saturday morning traffic getting out of town, the 1 1/4 hour trip took closer to 2 hours. However, with little traffic on the return trip, we made the voyage in the expected amount of time. Take the bus that arrives at the Centro terminal, not the Casino one. The Centro terminal is just a few blocks off the zocalo where you\\'ll find the palace. After a quick cup on the Plaza de Armas, I headed straight for the palace. For a Saturday, I was surprised and delighted by the light crowd at the museum. I have to admit that I didn\\'t focus on most of the collection, except a section of the museum that highlighted Emiliano Zapata and the Mexican Revolution, but rather beelined straight for the Rivera murals. Although the patio is relatively small, I had the entire mural to myself for more than a half hour. Rivera completed this mural in the mid-1920s. It presents scenes from the Conquest up through the 1910 revolution. Many of the scenes depict the cruelty of the conquistadors to the indigenous peoples. The scene entitled &quot;The Ravine&quot; is particularly captivating and the most memorable highlight of the entire mural. Although I could have easily spent more time focused on other aspects of the marvelous collection and building, Cortes really did build a fortress for himself, my time spent with the Rivera mural made my entire trip to Cueranvaca worthwhile.

This is why the whole complex is surrounded by walls, typical for those monasteries, which could then defend themselves in case of attacks. The Cathedral church suffered partial reconstructions and refurbishments which altered its aspect, especially in the interior.

What makes this site quite unique among others is its location on a large hill that overlooks an open valley where the hill itself is an integral part of the archaelogical site.  There are a number of platforms distributed at different levels of the hill that hold either a ceremonial center, the remains of living quarters, or the ancient ball courts.  At the top is the temple dedicated to Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent, with bas-reliefs sculptured on all four walls of the ceremonial center. It\\'s fun to climb the various wide staircases leading from one level to another, stop at each and enjoy the view of varying landscapes, which may include trees, agaves, and other assorted greenery.  You can descend the archeological zone from the opposite side you entered, so there\\'s no need to backtrack on your visit.\\nXochicalco reached its heigth around 1,000 AD when the Toltecs were the dominant culture in Mexico\\'s central valley, although it would be a far-out generalization to name the city-state\\'s inhabitants \\'Toltecs\\'.  They were skilled merchants and traded with distant civilizations in all cardinal directions, including the Mayans in the now far away Yucatan, the Zapotecs and Mixtecs to the south in the present State of Oaxaca, as well as the various cultures in the central valley of Mexico (now Mexico City) or the Gulf Coast.

He offered to walk me from the Restaurant to my Hotel but all I wanted was to get back to the Hotel away from the guy . I emailed the Manager of Hotel Riazor after I got home about my experience. It has been weeks later and I am still recovering from masses of mosquito bites all over my legs!\\nThank goodness all my other Tours were with Amigo Tours! My last Tour of my 2 week trip to Mexico City was Amigo Tours to Magical Towns of Real de Monte and Huasca de Ocampo with itching and hurting mosquito bites that made me look like I had measles or chicken pox...BUT Amigo Tours with Ivan was worth not cancelling my last tour( of 6 with them) as it was the very BEST Tour to me!\\nBeware of Turistica Ortega!

The fee for an adult is 70 MXN and entry for kids up to age 13 is free. \\n\\nPlease take the brochure with the information about the site which is kept in the reception area.

When you get there you will see a sign that says &quot;taquilla unica &quot;, follow the directions and you will get to an outdoor parking lot, enough space, clean and safe. Once there you go to a small museum where you can buy a ticket to access the site for less than 3.50USD. You go back to your car and drive back to the place where you came first and follow the signs to go to a second parking lot at walking distance. You can buy water there, they also have clean rest rooms. There are no restaurants there.  The archeological site is fantastic, with breath taking views. From the many areas to visit, I recommend the Quetzalcoatl temple, the ball game court and of course the observatory. These 3 are a must to visit if you are short of time. I recommend you google for more information and pictures.

Such a beautiful spot.\\n\\nAllow about 3 hours, more or less, for the museum and ruins.  We took the 11:04 Pullman Morelos bus from Cuernavaca, it drops you on the road and you can get a taxi for 30 pesos up to the museum entrance.  Coming back we did the same thing, but caught a local bus back to Cuernavaca at the crossroads and had to change to a bus that went into the town centre, dropping us near the Zocalo.

When it does run, there is one trip per day at 10:04.  To return, you will wait for the milk run bus back to the Centro Mercado.  We booked a oneway ticket the day before for Saturday - $40 Pesos each.  A bonus was the Pullman bus station is at the corner down the street from our hotel  Villas Bonita in Centro (same street as the Robert Brady Museum - at the corner of  Netzahualcoytl &amp; Mariano Abasolo).\\n\\nSecond means is by bus to and from from the bus station (jumbled transit exchange) at the central market.  To get to the market from Centro on foot (about a 15 minute walk) follow the oneway road (Gutenberg - the one that runs between the kitty-corner of the two Zocalo halves), walk opposite to the vehicle travel down hill until you cross the river.  Turn left (on Adolfo Lopez Mateos) at this busy intersection and in about 300 metres the central market and bus station will be on the right.  Make your way through the maze of vendors, up a few flights of steps and you will emerge at the transit hub.  Ask one of the many drivers where to catch the Xochicalco bus.  It will make several stops along the way so not as quick as the Pullman option.  90 minutes as opposed to 45 for Pullman.  However the price is only 15 Pesos.\\n\\nThe Pullman bus dropped us off at the park entrance, however you must go to the Museum on the other side of the valley (about 1 km on a pathway) to purchase the entry ticket ($65 Pesos).  A visit to the museum is a must see.  Well done, gorgeous building and it offers a fine view of the ruins across the valley.  The main drawback for us, its all in Spanish.  But when you get to the ruins, the markers have English translation.\\n\\nThe site:\\nWe have been to other ruins in Mexico, (Teotihuacan, Monte Alban, Mitla, Izapa) all are different.  We rate Xochicalco as one of the better ones for the amount and diversity of preserved structures.  It is not as large a site as Teotihuacan or Monte Alban but exceptional on its own.  Parts of it have some resemblance to Monte Alban.\\n\\nThe&quot;Observatario&quot; is open from 10 to 5, the same hours as the park.  However it is only accessible with a park guide.  If you are not in a tour group it is perfectly acceptable to enter with a guided group or if its a quiet day, the attendant may be waiting for you at the cave entrance.  Make the effort to check it out, you will be rewarded.  Overall its obvious why Xochicalco received UNESCO World Heritage listing in 1999.\\n\\nAfter our visit, we waited the 10 Mexico minutes  (35 actually) for the 90 minute return ride to the Cuernavaca Centro Mercado.\\nWe departed at 10 AM and we back at our hotel at 3:30 PM.\\n\\nIf you do not have time our do not want the public transit experience, you can hire a taxi - price unknown to us.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Archaeological Zone of Xochicalco", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/25/a2/62/ballspielplatz.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera Federal Xochicalco Tetlama, sin numero Xochicalco, Municipio de Miacatlan, Morelos", "addressLocality": "Cuernavaca", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "62605", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "349073312": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Interesting ruins", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150797-d318843-Reviews-Archaeological_Zone_of_Xochicalco-Cuernavaca_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/25/a2/62/ballspielplatz.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is a beautiful location that was chosen for the view on all sides.

We climbed Teotihuacan, took salsa lessons with Amore Salsa, visited the Robert Brady Museum, the Cathedral of Cuernavaca, Xochicalco, Tepotzl\\u00e1n (via una ruta, thanks to Maru!) Vista Hermosa, and the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe.  My students really enjoyed the VIP cinema on our last night of classes, and Las Estacas natural waterpark on the day before we left.\\n\\nThe school is in an area that is within walking distance to everything you need for a great trip, including tacos at La Gringa III, Italian Coffee, and pizza or pasta at Armando\\'s or Marco Polo, if you\\'re not sharing comida with your family.  If you\\'re not into walking much, the Radio Taxis are safe, prompt, and inexpensive. \\n\\nSpanish Language Institute is the BEST choice for a learning experience, plus more.....you\\'ll come away with improved Spanish, a love for Cuernavaca, and a promise to yourself to return.  &quot;Nunca,  Adi\\u00f3s.

At that time I\\'d been working on my Spanish for about a year but my progress was a bit slow.  (My goal is to someday be fluent so that I can use in my work at court and for travel...)In February I started Skype classes through this school with Marie who is an excellent instructor.  I then attended one week during my 10 day trip to Mexico. I  participated in the semi-private program (which ended up being private with Tere for three hours a day because I was the only student!), in addition to 2 1/2 hours of group classes with only three other students. For the group classes I was appropriately matched with some nursing students and we focused on health terminology which for me is very useful...\\nEven though it was only a week this experience really helped improve my conversation skills and gave me more confidence.  The teachers are excellent and the directors of the school, Maru and Paco, are incredibly kind and helpful with advice on local customs and safe travel tips.\\n\\nMuchas Gracias to Maru, Paco and teachers Marie, Tere, and Arminda!!! I will be back soon for another session.

There\\'s usually some kind of music in the afternoons. A couple of times a week people come to dance &quot;danz\\u00f3n,&quot; the mariachis hang out here and if you\\'re lucky you\\'ll hear them playing, a few times a week they have indigenous folk dances. My friends who live in Cuernavaca never go to the z\\u00f3calo, they don\\'t see the charm of it, but I really like it. It\\'s busy and bustling most of the time, traffic in the downtown area can be bad, but you can\\'t beat the spot for people watching. It is adjacent to another smaller square (where you see the gazebo). If there is some kind of political protest going on, it\\'s likely to happen here, but I have never felt in danger or been worried about violence. For the most part, the protests are peaceful sit-ins, and the people protesting are happy to explain why they\\'re protesting - you can get a lesson in current events if you speak Spanish and want to talk to them. My favorite thing to do in the mid-morning hours is buy a newspaper, sit at the cafe, read it while I have coffee, then stroll around and enjoy the sights. The Palace of Hernan Cort\\u00e9s faces the zocalo at one end, the government building is at the other end, and all around are restaurants and shops.

While the area was once sprawling countryside of coniferous woodland with rolling hills, it now lies within the confines of this modern city. Most of the visible 15 remains, built on a hill formed by lava flowing from the nearby Popo Volcano, date from the Early Aztec period of 1150 to 1350.\\n\\nSeveral of the reviews here are actually for Zona Arqueol\\u00f3gica el Tepozteco, which is in Tepoztlan, Mexico. Perhaps because the title of the site given here on Trip Advisor is incorrect.\\n\\nThere are some taxi drivers who are not familiar with Cuernavaca, of course, so be sure before you get in to ask, &quot;\\u00bfSabe usted la forma de las pir\\u00e1mides de Teopanzolco?&quot; before you get in the taxi. It is only a quick 10 minutes from downtown and the cost should not be more than 35 pesos. To arrive at the site, you only have to ask the taxi driver,\\n\\nYou should know that I am a bit jaded, as the Archeological Site of the Teopanzolco Pyramids is virtually in my backyard, as I live only a block and a half from them, and visit several times a week. It is part of my walking regimen and I enjoy siting in the shade in the quiet landscaped grounds and reading a book, while basking in the rich cultural history of Cuernavaca. What a shame that many visitors, which is apparent from the reviews here, that they define the historical importance of archeological sites by their size. Those with these expectations will never truly appreciate what they see in life. Teopanzolco provides a rich history of the Morelos Valley in which Cuernavaca sits. It was settled from about 2000 BC and there is evidence to believe that there was an earlier occupation in the great square of Teopanzolco.\\n\\nDuring the Classic Period, Teopanzolco came under the influence of the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. By the Postclassic Period, various Nahua groups had moved in the Altiplano; the Tlahuicas Indians founded the city of Cuauhnahuac (the pre-Spanish name for Cuernavaca) pronounced Kwaa-nah-wok sometime around 1200 AD when they first settled here. They built the Teopanzolco Pyramids before being conquered by the Aztec emperor Moctezuma Ilhuicamina in 1427 AD. The once-peaceful Tlahuicas were integrated into the Aztec Empire and forced to pay tribute in large amounts of cotton clothing and blankets and to participate in the Aztec military campaigns. In 1521, with the arrival of the Spaniards, the prehispanic history of Teopanzolco was brought to a close.\\n\\nIt is believed that Teopanzolco was the original Ceremonial Center of the city of Cuauhnahuac during the Early Aztec period (AD 1150\\u20131350) before the center was moved to a more defensible location, now the center of the modern city of Cuernavaca.\\n\\nThere are 15 structures within the park that were built between 1300 and 1521 and are of the Late Postclassic Period.\\n\\nThe most important and powerful structure is the central Great Platform. It was never finished and thus is the only pyramid to give present viewers the opportunity to see both the inner and outer structure and understand how the Aztec built their pyramids. The Ceremonial Center was dedicated (as was the Templo Mayor in Mexico City) to Huitzilopochtli (The God of the Sun, representing war and sacrifice) and Tlaloc (The God of Rain representing fertility and growth). 16th century Dominican Friar Diego Dur\\u00e1n wrote, &quot;These two gods were always meant to be together, since they were considered companions of equal power.&quot; Prior to the destruction of the Ceremonial Center, Great Platform supported two identical temples. On the north end was the Temple of Tlaloc and on the south was the Temple of Huitzilopochtli. The bases of the two temples are still intact. Tezcatlipoca, Ehecatl, among other Gods were worshiped at Teopanzolco.\\n\\nWhen the Spaniards arrived in Cuauhn\\u0101huac (renamed Cuernavaca by the Spaniards) and destroyed all symbols related to the past deities, the construction within the Ceremonial Center was stopped and the Ceremonial Center was covered over with dirt.\\n\\nWhat you see is the Ceremonial Center of Teopanzolco, which is only a small part of the prehispanic City of Cuauhn\\u0101huac, as most of the residential areas lie beneath the surrounding development. When the Spaniards arrived in Cuauhn\\u0101huac (renamed Cuernavaca by the Spaniards) and destroyed all symbols related to the past deities, the construction within the Ceremonial Center was stopped and the Ceremonial Center was covered over with dirt.\\n\\nThe Ceremonial Center lay hidden until 1910, when during the Mexican Revolution, Emiliano Zapata\\'s revolutionary forces installed cannons on top of the mound of dirt covering the Great Platform. When they begin firing shells into the federalist positions in the current center of Cuernavaca, the vibrations of the cannons shook loose the dirt and revealed the stonework below.\\n\\nHowever, it was not until 1921 that the first excavations began. Further excavations by Mexican archaeologists Rom\\u00e1n Pi\\u00f1a Chan and Eduardo Noguera took place in 1956 and 1957. Since 1985, the  Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\\u00eda e Historia (INAH) is responsible for maintenance and minor excavations.\\n\\nIt is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and it is recommended that you visit in the mornings during the warmer months. There is a very small museum in the main entrance of the park and there are displays in English and Spanish to explain the site. The entry fee is $37 MXN (about $2 USD), but is free on Sundays and to seniors over 60 years of age at any time.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Zona Arqueologica Teopanzolco", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/a4/c9/61/zona-arqueologica-teopanzolco.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Rio Balsas s/n, Teopanzolco Vista Hermosa Colonia Vista Hermosa", "addressLocality": "Cuernavaca", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "62350", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "361057844": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Worth a short visit if you\\'re in Cuernavaca ", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150797-d3949496-Reviews-Zona_Arqueologica_Teopanzolco-Cuernavaca_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/a4/c9/61/zona-arqueologica-teopanzolco.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "As another reviewer noted &quot;It ain\\'t Chichen Itza&quot;.

A nice place to walk around and experience some peace and quiet. Check out the art exhibits. They aren\\'t always well publicized but can be very interesting, and they\\'re included in the cost of admission to the gardens. Nice small bookshop on the premises (books mostly in Spanish).

It is a very peaceful spot in the middle of a busy (but not crazy) city.  The most impressive thing for me I think was the sheer size of the facility.  It must have once been quite majestic and beautiful.  The maintenance that would be necessary to truly keep such a place beautiful just isn\\'t happening.  I agree with another review that said the &quot;lake&quot; is just green a scummy.  Very true.  There are some friendly ducks there, great for taking photos and there are MANY places in the gardens to stop and take group pictures with family/friends, if you have someone who can take the picture for you.\\n\\nThe air is moist and cool in the gardens.  A nice refreshing change from the hot, sunny street outside.  If you are looking to escape the heat and aren\\'t staying in an air conditioned house or hotel, then that alone is a great excuse to spend some time at Jardin Borda.\\n\\nI would budget 2-3 hours to casually enjoy this facility, freely roaming.  Be sure to visit the gift shops for very reasonably priced items.  I recall there being a book sale when I was there.  \\n\\nIt is also important to note that as of the last time I was there, admission to Jardin Borda is free on Sundays.  Please confirm this locally before going if that\\'s an important factor for you.  Nonetheless, free is free.  Enjoy!\\n\\nP.S. -- the shoe shop just outside, across the street, has some great shoes for low prices.  My wife still wears a pair of leather sandals she purchased there 4 years ago.

A trip to the Brady Museum in the heart of downtown should be on everyone\\'s short list.  The entrance fee is not high, but you should opt to pay the extra $15 U.S. for a guided tour to explain all of the art and history that are here or it will go right by you as you stroll through on your own.  My guide was Sergio and he was able to offer the tour in any of several languages.  Brady was a resident of this city in recent times.  He collected art from all over the world.  If he liked it, he bought it, and brought it to his home.  When he died, he left his home and art as a gift to the City.  His friends who visited and stayed here were sports and entertainment icons from the 60\\'s, 70\\'s and 80\\'s that most of us knew.  He has an eclectic collection, from tribal masks and fertility gods to paintings and statuary from around the world.  For me the highlight was viewing an original painting by Frida Kahlo:  an amusing self-portrait of her with her pet monkey, which Mr. Brady acquired before she became famous to the world.  His ashes are also buried here in the garden next to those of his two beloved dogs.  Without a guide, you would miss this shady spot completely. Enjoy an hour or two respite from the busy City in this quiet relaxed place.  Then go back outside around the corner and tour the main cathedral that is hundreds of years old.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Robert Brady Museum", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/73/60/2e/fachada.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Netzahualcoyotl # 4", "addressLocality": "Cuernavaca", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "62000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "405835750": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "This was the best place we visited in Cuernavaca.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150797-d152975-Reviews-Robert_Brady_Museum-Cuernavaca_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/73/60/2e/fachada.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The art and decor of this are extraordinary.

I should add that the curator was extraordinarily helpful -- he generously answered all of our many questions and offered a few wonderful anecdotes of his own.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Robert Brady Museum", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/73/60/2e/fachada.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Netzahualcoyotl # 4", "addressLocality": "Cuernavaca", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "62000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "193372884": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "What a GEM!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150797-d152975-Reviews-Robert_Brady_Museum-Cuernavaca_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/73/60/2e/fachada.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We walked by this place several times and decided today to go in - partly because I read some recommendations on TA.

Dear Lady, don\\'t even think of that - you can\\'t believe how much you have to work to keep the place clean and in the GOOD museum order. Do you know that after the death of Mr, Brady they needed 4 years to clean everything and put it back into a special order?! This house has almost no glassed windows. And yes, this place is really unique. Only as multytalanted man as R. Brady was could fill his house up with so many masterpieces collected all around the world. This place is great not only for art lovers, but for decor lovers, history lovers, color lovers, human lovers... That\\'s why every time I am near Cuernavaca I always viisit this quiet and beautiful place. If you are lucky and during your visit you meet and listen to Serjio, their chief guide and specialist, you get much more reasons to love the place. Interesting - before we, visitors, start loving this place, it was Robert Brady himself who visited Cuernavaca, saw this place and fell in love so much that he decided to buy the mansion. It was a great deal. And now we understand - it was even better for us than for him.\\nThank you Mr. Brady for your great taste in everything. Thank you  Cuernavaca for having this gem.

He bought a home with a great location near the cathedral and decorated it with art and treasures from all over the world. You see his house as it was when he lived there. The colors in the various rooms were so bright. We especially liked the outdoor pool and lounging area plus the bathrooms and kitchen were decorated with the most far out colors of azulejos imaginable. Each room has a written description of most everything in it in both Spanish and English. There is a fee to get inside and you pay extra for using a camera. We decided to forgo the camera fee and regreted it afterwards. However, one can find loads of photos from the Brady Museum on the internet but they are brighter inn person. It is truly a highlight of a visit to Mexico.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Robert Brady Museum", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/73/60/2e/fachada.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Netzahualcoyotl # 4", "addressLocality": "Cuernavaca", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "62000", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "17264432": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Not to be missed", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150797-d152975-Reviews-Robert_Brady_Museum-Cuernavaca_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/73/60/2e/fachada.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Even if you are not an art lover like I am, the Robert Brady Museum is a must-see.

The Parmesan was all grated - not a particular problem but shards add to the dish. The lettuce seemed to be dressed in vinaigrette. When I dug down there was some white dressing. I asked for more but the overall taste was of vinaigrette and not Ceaser dressing... Service was sloppy. The small carafe of white wine arrived in a very cute ice bucket but some ice and water spilled out. No effort was made to clear that up and the ice began to melt and dripped onto my handbag.

dineros para esta actividad encontraras las siguientes tarifas $60 ni\\u00f1os, $50 adultos o bien el paquete familiar de $185 para 2 adultos y 2 menores, en virtud al costo no podemos pedir mas, apesar de ser relativamemte bajo el costo del museo ofrece actividades diversas para los peque\\u00f1os y la convivencia familiar, conserva la tematica toco, juego y aprendo,  las actividades  se desarrollan en un edificio de 2 niveles, por lo que para recorrer en su totaludad el museo y disfrutar de todas las actividades te llevara no mas de 6 horas, el area de burbujas es una de las favoritas de los visitantes por lo que no dudo en recomendarla, dentro de las restricciones esta prohibido ingresar con alimentos y bebidas sin embargo en el exterior se cuenta con una area especial para poder comer un refrigerio, cuenta con elevador para personas con discapacidad, en breve puedo recomendar invertir unas horas de su viaje en este museo si viajan con ni\\u00f1os la pasaran muy bien, la parte del estacionamiento se hace atravez del estacionamiento del centro comercial frente al museo el cual comparten el area, por lo que al salir se te recomienda selles tu boleto de estacionamiento ya que se te condonaran 2 hrs de estacionamiento, cada 8 o 15 dias se realizan espectaculos especiales tematicos por lo que te recomiendo sigas la pagina de redes sociales para estar atento y programar tu visita.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Papalote Museo del Nino", "image":
