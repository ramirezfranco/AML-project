We asked the waiter if he knew of anyone who could take us to the Marietas Islands and he recommended Thomas. My husband paid him $100 USD and he took the 4 of us out for 3 hours to snorkel. It was an amazing time. The Marietas are only about 15 minutes from Punta de Mita rather than a couple hours if you leave from the Marina in Puerto Vallarta. When we came back from our snorkerling trip the restaurant workers were really nice about letting us use their bathrooms to change.

Some of us stayed at the El Anclote condos.  The complex consists of 5 buildings, each with 3 floors and an elevator.  It\\'s gated, has parking, and a pool.  It is nicely situated on top of a small hill, which affords each condo beautiful, breathtaking, panoramic views of Banderas Bay.  We had a corner pent house condo, and it was quite large - 2-bedrooms, 2-bathrooms, kitchen, laundry room, living/dining room, foyer, high ceilings, spacious balcony.  Our condo had A/C, which came in handy.  There were towels (bath and beach), laundry detergent, kitchen-ware, etc. for our use.  Although some condos could use a little updating, some were very well-maintained.\\n\\nThere are plenty of activities in the Punta de Mita area:  golfing, fishing, ziplining.  The kids had a blast learning to surf with Ricardo Andrade of Olas Vallarta.  And we had a chance to take a boat trip to Las Islas Marietas.  It was hard to snorkel there as the seas were a bit rough that day - but we enjoyed watching the humpback whales along the way.  One of the wedding activities was a ladies\\' event at the Villa Ananda Spa - it was heavenly practising yoga by the beach in the morning sun.\\n\\nRegarding the condos, the only advice I have is to make sure you get what the owners (or brokers) advertise, and what you paid for.  This is true for all condo rentals, not just at the El Anclote.  For instance, our condo advertised satellite TV, but there wasn\\'t one - in fact, there was only one channel.  We were there at the time of the Olympic games, and my family wanted to watch some of the events - one of the reasons I chose this condo was because it had satellite TV.  My husband and teenagers went across the street to the Hotels des Artistes to get their Olympic fix.  Another false advertisement:  the walkway/bridge for direct access to the beach is closed indefinitely, due to some legal problems.  We had to use the car to drive my 84-year-old father-in-law across the street, as he had difficulty negotiating the steep hill to the beach and restaurants.  The condo also had a telephone number where people could reach us - the only problem was, there wasn\\'t a telephone in the condo!  I reported the problem to the broker we had been dealing with for the condo rental, but no phone appeared.  Unfortunately, with wedding and family reunion activities, we made so many local calls.  I just received my cell phone roaming charges, which is why I\\'m writing this review!   \\n\\nBefore you hand your money over, just double-check everything that\\'s being offered.  Go through the list with the owner/broker, get expectations out in the open, and identify big-deal items.  Renters should be compensated if the owners don\\'t fulfill their end of the deal.  And ask for a contact (preferably a local one) who can be entrusted to sort out problems - quickly.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "El Anclote", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/15/12/24/playa-anclote.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Av.

If so, you are in for a treat.  By far the calmest, most family friendly beach in the Vallarta region.  We had a car, drove north for about an hour to Punta Mita, home of a few resorts, the fabulous 4 Seasons, etc.   We drove along the coast and ended up at an esplanade or roundabout.  You can go straight or down to the beach at the roundabout. Go left down to the beach and park at the El Dorado retauraunt on the beach.  Go in, secure a prime palapa and table in yourt sling back chairs overlooking the bay, order whatever you want, we had the cameron quesadilla, the best ever, Mismaloya is second best!  OK, the best thing about this beach, no waves, clear blue/green water, very Mediterranean like, the sand is super soft.  Good snorkeling, you can walk out 100 yards and be waist deep very little if any rocks, 99% sand!  Lose yourself in this bay from the El Dorado.  Magnificent.  It was tough to leave.  By far, the cleanest, softest sand, best snorkeling (take a pair of goggles), and just perfect beach.  THe palapas provide plenty of shade, El Dorado likes the real palm palapas and they throw in a bunch of green and gold umbrellas for those with fair skin to seek refuge.  Being an Oakland A\\'s fan, I felt tight at home! I was looking in one of the Vallarta promotional magazines a day or 2 later and the picture was from the El Dorado, promoting another timeshare or something.  It truly is picture perfect, great retaraunt, view, experience.  I loved it.  If you have an extra day or 2, Yelapa, and Anclote!  Make it happen!  Bring a towel and some sunscreen, enjoy what very few other tourists experience.
