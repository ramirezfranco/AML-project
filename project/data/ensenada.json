We returned to the hillside tasting room and had an off in the dark tasting experience that didn\\u2019t quite cut it due to technical difficulties and uncertainty with the translations. However overall the folks were very friendly and tried hard to make our visit informative and pleasant. It would probably be a good idea for the winery to polish up those items or stick to the vineyard tasting experiences. \\n\\nThe wines we had were cleanly made though one was over the hill. This is something we\\u2019ve noted at several Mexican wineries, they\\u2019re holding onto their wines for way to long before releasing.

After some prodding, our server brought us some delicious rosemary cheese with Ritz crackers and we enjoyed the one reserve wine that she poured last. We purchased a couple of bottles of wine and the tasting plus wine and food came to more than $60 - rather pricey we thought, and without the customer service we ususally experience at wineries. During the course of our tasting, the server told us all about the wonderful tours for which one must reserve. Too bad - we would have enjoyed that and felt all the worse about the winery for knowing there was something we weren\\'t able to experience.

Short, sweet and simple- some folks need to enjoy their tastings, others are content to throw a shot across their tongue and call it done.  Our tour group arrived and stepping off the bus noted the winery had a location on the opposite side of the street as well this side, ours was the showroom entry. The showroom had a previous life as a bank and its old vault was obvious as wine shelves framed its door.  Over the counter just inside the front door hung a large menu of wines and their associated prices. The entire room was dark possibly from the black paint used to adorn the walls.  Granted, bottled wines do not relish the companionship of direct sun and even less, the associated heat.  However, the room was cool making it wine friendly.  Being an oenophile but not a connoisseur this was to be my introduction to this wine making region. Too bad their taste offerings were not those of other vintners.  Beginning with the vessel in which the tasting was being offered this showroom apparently came down on the side of the tour participant describe in the opening remarks as those who don\\'t enjoy wines.  The red and white offerings were rendered in small, non-transparent cups thus offering little bouquet to enjoy.  There was plenty of the counter wines to go around but their best was only released at the insistence of several of the more knowledgeable tour participants.  This wine tasting tour did not rise to this traveler\\'s expectations.   Conversely, it did provide some interesting photographic opportunities of a large vat, waiting wine bottles and other scenes", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Bodegas de Santo Tomas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/f6/05/6d/bodegas-de-santo-tomas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Miramar 666 btwn Calles 6 & 7", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "22800", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "190868255": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Rude and confusing", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d152868-Reviews-Bodegas_de_Santo_Tomas-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/f6/05/6d/bodegas-de-santo-tomas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We got tired of walking around the souvenir shops and went inland a few blocks to the BST in-town winery.

We stayed for almost two hours, enjoying the great afternoon sun, an amazing breeze that cooled us off even on a 90 degree day, and panoramic views of the valley. \\n\\nWe got lucky in that the bodega normally closes at 5 and having arrived about 4:30, we were able to also sample and purchase food products from a pair of local women who had set up a small stand just outside the entrance to the main building. The women offered homemade empanadas with mango, strawberry and apple fillings (all delicious) and a wide array of sauces and spreads, including mango lime, mango chipotle, chimichurri...and really good olives. I don\\'t know how often they are there, but if you see them, try everything. The quality off the product is excellent and the flavors proved to be very pleasant surprises. \\n\\nIn terms of wine tasting, I was able to sample about five wines, all quite good, though my favorite was a cab sav, followed by a Syrah. The winery produces grapes in three different valleys and the variety of wines is unusual for the area, I think they mentioned 35 varieties. Since they only export by mail order, you won\\'t find these wines at your local Costco - at least not yet. We went to several other wineries, but the selection was largest at Santo Tomas and the wines were really quite tasty. \\n\\nOf course, sipping it on the terrace of the the bodega under a comforting shade, our eyes filled with nothing but sun-drenched hills, vineyards and olive groves dancing in the light wind, it would have taken some dedication to a gripe to be able to complain at all. \\n\\nThe most challenging part of the experience is driving down to Ensenada (about 90 min from TIjuana), a relatively easy experience except for the Tijuana part. I recommend a Mexico GPS program of some sort, pointed towards Ensenada.

But be sure to visit the Valle itself, perhaps try one of the other wineries, visit the tiny museum that documents the Russians who settled the area and started the wine-making process in the late 1800s, stop on the way out or back on the only route (Route 3) about 20 miles from Ensenada at Restaurante Los Naranjas for a delightful lunch in a bucolic garden setting.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Bodegas de Santo Tomas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/f6/05/6d/bodegas-de-santo-tomas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Miramar 666 btwn Calles 6 & 7", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "22800", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "1557145": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Wine tasteing", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d152868-Reviews-Bodegas_de_Santo_Tomas-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/f6/05/6d/bodegas-de-santo-tomas.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I have done the tour a couple of times ,it used to be 2 dollars ,The tour takes about 20 minutes and then some wine tasteing , I have read that the price is 5 dollars now, they have discount coupons around town 50 cents off.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Bodegas de Santo Tomas", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/f6/05/6d/bodegas-de-santo-tomas.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Miramar 666 btwn Calles 6 & 7", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "22800", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Vinedo_Cuatro_Cuatros-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California": {"659536282": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Incredible view", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d8599926-Reviews-Vinedo_Cuatro_Cuatros-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/b9/9c/c6/photo1jpg.jpg", "datePublished": "March 19, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Nice and dangerous drive to the vineyard, the property host lots, hotel, wine tasting, very impresive party area that would make a spectacular wedding event, have to take property transportation to go up to the bar and viewing area, incredible views with good eats, just remember drive back is dangerous., Don\\u00b4t enjoy the drinks to much or better yet take a designated driver.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Vinedo Cuatro Cuatros", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/b9/9c/c6/photo1jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Carretera Tijuana-Ensenada Km. 89 s/n El Tigre", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "648398873": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "The best view in Ensenada", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d8599926-Reviews-Vinedo_Cuatro_Cuatros-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/b9/9c/c6/photo1jpg.jpg", "datePublished": "January 26, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Great place to see sunset!

I made sure, as I always do so during my travel outside the United States (Saint Peter\\'s Cathedral in Rome, and Saint Paul\\'s Shipwreck Church in Malta, for two examples), to visit the main local church in Ensenada, where a sculpture of Jesus Christ stands tall with an inscription saying that the sculpture was made in France and then transported to Ensenada in or about the 18th century. My wife and I even participated in the Sunday mass given by the church priest when, in that process, I watched, and was deeply moved, by a local believer, who, though dressed in what looked like his work clothing and appeared quite beaten in his daily life, was perfectly in attention to every detail of the ongoing church mass.

We saw them enjoying date nights out in the town, eating meals at nearby restaurants and cafes, and taking Sunday strolls with their families. For our own &quot;Ladies Night&quot; out, we truly saw First Street come alive at night and it delivered. It was an easy walk from our hotel to Papas and Beers. As I always advise my clients, its always safer to walk in groups or taking an uber at night, but we felt relatively safe. Always take in stride that in Ensenada or in Mexico (or really any city in the world, yes, even Paris), you will will see the good, the bad and the funky, but that is truly immersing yourself in a culture.

The atmosphere was lovely with music, laughter, couples in love, families with children, friends hanging out, and sole travelers. We talked to several locals who gave us a history of the area. The food was decent at a local taco shop where we enjoyed the outdoor seating and live music under a sidewalk canopy.\\n\\nWe opted to visit an &quot;off the beaten path&quot; bar called QueZesos (I believe) instead of the more popular branded bars, and we were glad that we did. There was a rooftop area that allowed us to see the hillside homes and the corner of First Street that intersects near Papas and Beers. The food (pizza) and drinks were very reasonably priced. But, I\\'d go for the drinks and maybe pass on the pizza and try some tacos in Mexico.\\n\\nOne of the taxi drivers actually help us navigate the streets instead of trying to force us to get a taxi ride.

It\\'s really cool to see so many people from all over the world get together to party and celebrate together. Just always bring extra clothing for the nights that get chilly once the sun sets because the ocean breeze does cool it down quite a bit even in summer if your used to the heat like in SoCal.

But the hotel was never profitable due to the end of the prohibition and bad road from the United States. It went from being a hotel to a military headquarter ,partly demolished  and its gorgeous enourmous chandelier was not robbed only because it didn\\'t fit through the door until finally taken  by the Mexican government... to be converted to a cultural center...\\nThe really beautiful roaring 30-40 feet ceiling on the main salon is built in intricate worn cypress wood with a enormous glorious chandelier with perfectly laid floor in the most exquisite Spanish motif.  But the most striking of all, right off the main atrium is located the biggest bar area. Built in dark wood, there are seven BAR areas with an amazing mural in the background despicting the SIX sins of mankind plus the portrait of the painter in the last one.... There are 3 great ballrooms (salon) which are used to celebrate weddings and birthdays.  My favorite is the Salon Rojo with a beautiful great Painting on the fireplace with its own authentic Spanish courtyard.  Even the colorful history of the American woman named Marjorie King Plant, which inspired the creation of the famous Mexican cocktail &quot;Margarita&quot; in one of Bars of the hotel, added an allure to this beautiful mystical place.  \\nIf you are visiting Ensenada, visiting this gorgeous building is a must.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Cultural Center of Ensenada", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/07/a1/8f/photo2jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "374692764": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Very good mixed cultural events", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153541-Reviews-Cultural_Center_of_Ensenada-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/07/a1/8f/photo2jpg.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Saw a very good guitar recital with a quartet of excellent players.

Not the finest and exceptional wines, but fine enough to try something different.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Casa de Dona Lupe", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/fe/59/5d/la-casa-de-dona-lupe.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Valle de Guadalupe Parcela 72-92", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "436683503": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Great Place", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d2519560-Reviews-La_Casa_de_Dona_Lupe-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/fe/59/5d/la-casa-de-dona-lupe.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Great organic wines at a beautiful setting.

One of our stops was at La Casa de Dona Lupe.  I\\'m not a drinker, so the wine sampling which others enjoy, just isn\\'t my thing.

There are musicians dressed in feathers playing music outdoors which brings a lot of atmosphere to the place.

Keep in mind you\\'ve got to know your table number before you order or you\\'ll be waiting in that food line for nothing.  The best part for me was trying the jams and cheese spreads.  They have about 20 different bottles out for you to try.  I wanted to try all of them!  But I was embarrassed as there\\'s a lady behind the counter watching you.  Not that she said anything when I tried about 8 options, but I felt embarrassed tasting so many.  Each is better than the next.  I ended up taking home the Mango/Tamarindo/Chipotle spread.  I let our au pair have some when we got home and it was such a hit with both of us, that she probably had most of the bottle within 1 1/2 weeks and I barely got 3-4 spreads of toast out of it all.

That said, not being huge fans of Mexico and it\\'s reputation (we live next door in San Diego, CA), our cruise was to stop in Ensenada, Mexico. \\n\\nWe decided to book this 2 winery excursion through Carnival. The first stop was a large, commercial place called L. A. Cetto which I\\'ve reviewed separately. The second was this mom and pop type smaller place, La Casa de Do\\u00f1a Lupe. \\n\\nWhat a great experience! Did you hear me? Great experience!\\n\\nWe felt safe and comfortable the entire tour. Very professional.\\n\\nUpon boarding the VERY nice tour bus, our guide introduced himself as &quot;Rigo&quot;. But, because he has super curly hair, he said he is AKA Curly. He told some cute stories along the way, pointing out significant Mexican sites. Curly also pointed out how &quot;quiet the ride is TO the wineries...and that the ride back is entirely different!&quot; \\n\\nBoy, was it! So much fun!\\n\\nWe had a nice group of people ranging from early 20\\'s to late 60\\'s. It happened to be my 50th birthday and 31st anniversary that week of the cruise, so the whole bus sang to my husband and I!\\n\\nWine and taste are subjective to the individual, so I\\'ll not review the wines themselves.\\n\\nThe wineries on this tour took us to the Valle Guadalupe area of Baja California.  \\n\\nBe sure to dress comfortably, as there are areas that you\\'ll walk over sandy/gritty driveway, and brick patios. High heels aren\\'t a good idea here. Flat shoes or sandals, or even flip flops are perfect. It is nice and cool inside the commercial buildings at large winery, but most of your time is spent outdoors at La Casa de Do\\u00f1a Lupe. It could be hot and dry outdoors depending on time of year. We were there in late May, and it was absolutely perfect. \\n\\nHere they have a tiny local market and grill, a very limited amount of touristy items such as chili sauces, soaps, herbs, and such. I am not sure if you can bring herbs back to the US.? But, you can bring the sauces and such.\\n\\nThere is a nice patio area here with pub and patio tables and chairs. If you want shade, there are large trees with seating areas under them. Chickens and roosters roaming free. \\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised to see a woman offering neck and back massage under the trees. She has one of those chairs on which you sit and place your face into the doughnut shape cushion - while seated. For only 5$US, I received a nice 5 minute (more like 7+ minutes) massage and left feeling so great!\\n\\nOh, wine! \\n\\nBack to the wine... Here, they serve wines for tasting in what I thought were glass votives. More homey feeling. Like you were at your aunt\\'s house for a backyard gathering. \\n\\nThey\\'ll give you a ticket that they tear a piece off upon each tasting. Up to you which ones you\\'d like. They also served some yummy thin crusted pizza or flat breads, freshly baked bread with cream cheese and jalape\\u00f1o filling, and a variety of hot sauces. We loved it! Trust me, try it all!\\n\\nTime to head back to the ship, Rigo and the driver, Jesus, gave us a parting gift of a bottle of wine, which was a nice touch. They also offered a chance to be dropped off in town if you\\'d like. Several did. We chose to go back to the ship.\\n\\nTip: Bring a bit of cash if you\\'d like to purchase anything at the smaller winery, and to tip. I believe that the larger place takes credit cards. Tips are also appreciated by the driver and guide. Tips at the wineries are not promoted, but, they deserved them for doing such a fantastic job of serving the small tour crowd.\\n\\nAll in all, it was A+ and we\\'d do it again! Forget the shopping for junky trinkets...take a winery tour and see the countryside.\\n\\nAnother tip: For CALIFORNIA residents, you are allowed to bring back up to 5 CASES of wine per person (as opposed to the smaller amount per person for hard alcohol). I didn\\'t believe it and looked it up myself. \\n\\nHere is what the California ABC website states upon returning from Mexico:\\n&quot;A California resident or any other person crossing the international border via common carrier may bring in a reasonable quantity of alcoholic beverages (up to five cases or 60 liters) provided the beverages are for personal or household use.&quot; https://www.abc.ca.gov/permits/importing.html\\nFor non-California residents, you will have to look up your state\\'s ABC laws.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Casa de Dona Lupe", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/fe/59/5d/la-casa-de-dona-lupe.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Valle de Guadalupe Parcela 72-92", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "224189296": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Adorable winery!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d2519560-Reviews-La_Casa_de_Dona_Lupe-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/fe/59/5d/la-casa-de-dona-lupe.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I visited this winery as part of a Carnival Cruise excursion and I was pleasantly surprised.

John, I and 45 of our closest friends were bused to two wineries: one very large and one very small.\\n\\nAs we left the port, our guide (Gloria) strongly hinted that we should be tipping her and the driver (Jesus) at the end of the tour. During the 40-minute drive, Gloria gave us some information on the history and economic conditions in this part of Mexico but admitted that she did not know much about wine (she prefers whiskey) or the wineries we would be visiting. As we approached the first winery, Gloria informed us that she would handle the tips there but we should tip at the second winery. John and I have toured and tasted at over 100 wineries all over the world and this is the first time there has been any suggestion that the wine pourers were expecting us to tip them.\\n\\nThe second winery, La Casa de Dona Lupe, is an extremely small wine operation. In addition to wine, it produces liquors, herbs, jams, spreads, filled breads and pizzas. We were encouraged to taste the jams and spreads on our own; Gloria had a couple of the stuffed breads and pizzas cut up so that we could each have a small taste of those. Each of us received a card that entitled us to four small pours of wine. No descriptions of the wines were offered by the pourers; in fact, they never spoke at all and Gloria was naturally of no help. I did not see a tip jar but no one there was doing anything that deserved a tip anyway. The wines were non-vintage and of uncertain variety. They were at best drinkable but only marginally. The food was better. At one point, we had a brief glimpse of Dona Lupe herself and there was a costumed dancer doing native dances and selling jewelry. At least there were clean bathrooms.\\n\\nThe other winery was L. A. Cetto. Altogether this was a decent way to spend a port day in Ensenada.

There are four wines for tasting, a white, two reds and honey wine. While I normally do not like sweet wines, the honey wine was very good. You are offered bread and cheese with your wine, and pizza is available for purchase. I\\'m not a wine expert, but I do consider myself to be a pizza connoisseur, and I definitely recommend it! Inside the shop, there are many jams, jellies, hot sauces and other products to sample. Don\\'t miss the opportunity to try them all. Olive oil is also available for sale.

You will need to use a flashlight (most people have one on their cell phones) to inspect some of the old jail cells, which, in a few, display artwork by the resident inmates from years ago.

A couple of the cells contain old photographs, and some old letters, still being curated at the time of our visit.  Really, if you can take a half hour away from the craziness of the shops and bars and street vendors, we think you will love this free museum.

We left on time and he filled us in on many Ensenada highlights during our 20-30 minute bus ride to and from the ranch.  Once there we were greeted by owner Rita and her ranch hands who had a team of healthy horses of all sizes ready for our group (13 of us in our family) plus 2 or 3 other smaller groups.  The horses looked so healthy and happy and we had a fantastic 4 mile ride.  Wish we could have gone a little faster but I understand that we had various ages and sizes and the horses needed to stay together.  Once back at the ranch, we were met with drink, food, photos (all optional) before heading back to the port.

My tween son and I, middle aged, have never road horses until that morning on the beach at another location in Ensenada where we felt highly stressed out, and worried about our safety and wellbeing.  We had a communication break down because the men in charge didn\\u2019t speak English. The horses felt like they in pain and couldn\\u2019t handle my weight.  I felt bad for the old, overworked, scrawny, unhappy horse, so we cut our $30.00 an hour horse ride short.  Lastly, there was a misunderstanding about our carriage ride back to our Carnival Cruise Ship. They wanted $20.00 a piece to and from our ship to the horse riding beach.  The $40.00 carriage ride was not worth the worry of getting cut by the exposed rusty edges of the rickety carriage.  Even though the morning horseback riding experience left both of us weary about our upcoming afternoon horseback riding excursion at Rancho Los Bandidos, I was glad we did have this negative morning beach experience, so we could compare and contrast the similarities and differences between the two horseback riding experiences.  Although Rancho Los Bandidos cost twice as much as the horseback riding on the beach, it was WORTH THE MONEY!  I consider Los Bandidos a value for the price by way of safety being number one, a clear and simple lesson on how to ride and control the personalized horse they match you up considering, weight, height, personality, and riding experience. There was constant assistance in clear understandable English, tour explanation of the area, and safe monitoring of the single file line ride through the gorgeous hills overlooking Baja Mexico/California. We stopped to take photos to capture the majestic view. The ocean never looked so beautiful matching the magnificent blue skies while the wind gently whisks through ones hair riding through the slow to medium horse ride.  If you don\\u2019t have a camera, they take your photo on your horse just before your ride that you may purchase for $10.00 after the ride is over where they allow you to freshen up in the restrooms, and make your way to the Saloon where they have free lemonade, punch, cold fresh water, chips and salsa.  Tocos cost a dollar and tips are appreciated at this point. They have well earned their tips by being courteous, friendly, helpful, efficient, called you by your first name, drove us in an air-conditioned but to and from the ship.  All was included with the cost.  I plan on doing this again with my son, but next time bring his older sister, so she may also have a priceless Baja California/Mexico memory of a lifetime.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Rancho Los Bandidos", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/6e/1e/a0/rancho-los-bandidos.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Domicilio Conocido", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "68430", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "166799670": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful view and exciting ride!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d3513272-Reviews-Rancho_Los_Bandidos-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/6e/1e/a0/rancho-los-bandidos.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I\\'ve been on quite a few horseback trail rides and this is the best.

Take the &quot;Carretera transpeninsular&quot; all the way south. Between San Quintin town and El Rosario pay attetion because there is only one small blue sign on the road that will tell you where you have to turn right immediately and leave the road..... keep going to the beach and you will find this beautiful place. I do not recomend driving a small car as there is no pavement, no signs, no security, get a truck and if its rain season make sure it is 4X4 as it can get veeeery muddy. This is a natural human population free place. The sea comes through a cave where sea Lions have their own private beach, it can all be seen from above. The ocean views are amazingly beautiful and the sunset is breath taking.

We planned the trip\\'s itinerary ourselves by researching wineries, wines, restaurants, Airbnb\\'s and routes on the internet.  Three married couples went.  The three husbands are partners in home winemaking, so we selected wineries whose wines were highly rated rather than wineries that were highly rated for their facilities, views or food.  We only took USDs, not pesos, with us.\\nWe left San Diego about 8:30am in an Uber XL for the border, arriving at PedWest (directly across the street from Outlets at the Border) about 9:00am.  We then walked across the border thru PedWest, stopping at Mexican Immigration/Customs Center building to fill out visa forms (we all have Passport cards plus Global Entry cards), then arriving, about 9:30am at a plaza where taxis await passengers.  Here we met up with our Mexican driver and his van.  \\nThe driver, Antonio Hernandez, and his wife, Rosa, live in Guadalupe Valley.  They have started a small Guadalupe Valley tour company with at least two new, very nice vans that we road in; one just right for the six of us, and a second much larger.  We found this couple through common friends/acquaintances, and were extremely satisfied with their services.  Antonio ferried us around from Saturday morning until Sunday late afternoon when he dropped us off at PedWest.  He charged us $70 USD per couple per day, but we paid him $80 USD per couple per day to include tip, so at the end of our trip we six paid him $80 USD X 3 couples X 2 days = $480.  I think we gave him $500.  It was well worth it.  Their email address is Alanantonio08092017@gmail.com, and Antonio\\'s cell phone is 011-52-1-646-144-0374.  Our plan was to visit three wineries and two restaurants (lunch &amp; dinner) on Saturday and three wineries and two restaurants (breakfast and lunch) on Sunday.  \\nOn Saturday, after being picked up by Antonio in his van, we drove about 35 miles to Gary\\'s La Fonda restaurant on highway 1D, about 3.3 miles south of Campo Lopez.  This is an interesting restaurant, with a great ocean view and roosters walking around the tables, in which we enjoyed our lunches and drinks.  After lunch, Antonio drove us to Guadalupe Valley, about a 25-mile trip.  We stopped first at Tres Valles winery.  This is a small winery with a small wine tasting room, but their wines, Assistant winemaker Alejandro and their art creations were great.  This was one of our favorite winery of the six that we visited, if not the favorite one.  Next, we visited Vinisterra winery that had great wines and vineyard views.  We recommend this winery too.  Our last winery of the day was Vinas de Garza.  This winery and its wines were OK, but we liked the first two much better.  I probably would not recommend this place but try another in its place.  We then drove to our Airbnb and checked in and rested up a bit before leaving for dinner. \\nOur Airbnb was a nice, two story house, on a nice piece of property with vineyards, in a gated community.  It had two very nice bedrooms and bathrooms downstairs, and some beds (but no bathroom) in the second story loft that we did not like much.  It was a &quot;cabana&quot; located in the Ejido el Porvenior section of the Valley, across the street from the restaurant Finca Altozano, and cost us $405.65/night.  The owner is Carlos Bernardo, phone 011-52-1-646-226-8616.\\nSaturday night we ate at Laja restaurant, an outstanding restaurant that we highly recommend.  Reservations are probably necessary since it is not large.  They have prix fixe (&quot;fixed price&quot;) menus, probably different every night.  The menus lists eight items, in groups of two, with and without wine pairings.  One must choose a four course or eight-course meal, with or without wine pairings with each course.  Our menu listed Lettuce salad / Octopus, Bonita fish tartar / Mushroom risotto, Catch of the day / Braised beef, and Coffee panna cotta / pastry.  Their price for the four-course meal (which we all had with wine pairings) was 920 pesos, or 1,420 pesos with wine pairings, and for the eight-course meal, 1,350 pesos, or 2,050 pesos with wine.  They exchanged at only 17 pesos per USD, so total bill for six of us without tip was 8,583 pesos, or $504.88 USD if US cash were used.  I used my credit card that does not charge a currency exchange fee, and exchanged at 19 pesos/USD, so cost was only $451.74 USD before tip.  It was expensive, but we all felt it was well worth it, and we hope to return to this restaurant someday.  After dinner, we returned to our Airbnb for the night.\\nSunday morning Antonio picked us up and drove us to Hacienda Guadalupe restaurant where we had great breakfasts.  We next went to the Wine Museum, which we all enjoyed.  We also went to the local Russian museum that was OK but not great.  I highly recommend Hacienda Guadalupe for breakfast, and a visit to their Wine museum.  When we started our trip, we told Antonio where we wanted to go, only allowing him to determine the order.  Antonio knows the Guadalupe Valley well, and therefore has his recommendations for wineries and restaurants.  If/when we return, we may let Antonio at least propose his favorites to us.  On our trip, he especially promoted a winery J.C. Bravo, for their dry-farmed wines, so we decided to visit his recommended winery in lieu of planned L.A. Ceto winery that has high ratings for both wines and winery.  L.A. Ceto is a large winery, and we prefer smaller wineries such as J.C. Bravo.  We enjoyed this winery; it was OK, not great.  We then went to La Lomita and Vino de Piedra wineries, both very nice wineries with great wines.  We recommend both of them.\\nBefore heading home, we had lunch at Finca Altozano restaurant.  Lunch and the restaurant were great.  After lunch, Antonio drove us with some wine that we had purchased at wineries back to PedWest where he dropped us off and we paid him.  We walked back thru PedWest, then Ubered home, arriving home about 7:30pm, very tired.  It was a great trip that we hope to repeat sometime.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Tres Valles Vitivinicola", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/68/d0/e0/tres-valles-vitivinicola.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Lerdo de Tejada Ignacio Comonfort", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "22766", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "658890377": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Wine ", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d3267417-Reviews-Tres_Valles_Vitivinicola-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/68/d0/e0/tres-valles-vitivinicola.jpg", "datePublished": "March 16, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Really enjoyed this winetasting.

I know the process and what goes into making a fine wine. They are getting everything right at Tres Valles Winery in the Valle de Guadalupe, 15 miles inland from Ensenada, Baja Ca. The location is in the westward vineyards, closer to the ocean, with some incredible local craft art. Some of their red blends rival Cain 5 in Napa, and at only a fraction of the price. The best bargain is Jala\\' 2013, a blend of Cabernet Sauvigon and Grenache Noir, only 200 pesos ($11.25). It is a rich but not heavy blend with a great finish. The deal of the century has to be a blend called MAAT 2013 that is 90% Grenache Noir, 10% petite Sarah and is just ambrosia from start to finish, 250 pesos ($14) They had 2 others that were a tad fruity or a tad dry but still excellent. I just didn\\'t buy those. If the two wines I recommended were for sale in Napa or central California, you would be paying at least $30-50. for them. If you buy two bottles of wine, there is no tasting charge. The Barista Alejandro was very knowledgeable and helpful. He is studying for a Doctorate in Viticulture.

Don\\'t expect 1/2 off, but you should get something.\\n\\nPay in pesos not dollars.\\n\\nFresh fish is weighed &quot;on the fin&quot; - so you pay for the entire fish.  If you just want fillets, they will do it for you, but you still pay for the whole fish.\\n\\nSpeaking of weighing, make sure that they put the metal &quot;basket&quot; on the scale before they weigh your purchase to make sure it is fairly close to zero.  A favorite &quot;trick&quot; is to leave the basket off and have the scale set at zero -  so when the basket is put on with your selection you get shorted (paying for the weight of the basket too).\\n\\nFriendly banter does go a long way here.  It can be a shopping adventure!\\n\\nBTW - outside of the market are several small restaurants.  The 2nd one from the street is my favorite.

The crab claws we had when we got home were spoiled (foul), the corbina water-logged and fell apart after baking (inedible), our friend bought the halibut but it was switched with ray or shark that was rotten and inedible when arriving in San Diego that evening (look in the black bag before leaving if you\\'re smart, we trusted them, our mistake). We grabbed two small lobsters which were overpriced and of fair quality, however, I could have bought them in Los Angeles for the same price or less after assessing our first two loses. Bottom line, beware, we will never shop there again, this place needs fish police badly. These guys are con artists. We saw them bringing in frozen bluefin tunas from last summer, good luck with those.

We paid $2 per person to ride a shuttle, which they waited until EVERY seat was full before we left.

They charge $1 for a return trip.  \\n\\nWe felt very safe the whole time here.  People were friendly and joked around.

We asked a few vendors, but not many had anything of super interest until we came across Casa Ramirez store.  We had the pleasure to meet a lady at the store who was very informative and took her to the upstairs of her store and had a beautiful altar set up to view.  They had tons of items to choose some that it was a hard decision!  Awesome store and wonderful staff!!!

Since this is in the tourist zone, expect to pay higher prices though. Streets are packed with tourists when the cruise ships are in (Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday).\\n\\nDon\\'t miss trying some of the Mexican Ice Cream, which is much better than what you get in the U.S. and is all natural...the way it used to be made.\\n\\nIf you would like to shop where the locals do, then simply walk four blocks into the city (on Ruiz or Gastelum) to a street called Juarez, which is lined with all kinds of stores, cheaper prices, and less sales pressure. Watch where you step though because the sidewalks may not be as well maintained as Lopez Mateos\\n\\nPesos or Dollars:\\nU.S. dollars are generally accepted here, however note that the exchange rate may be better or worse depending on the store. \\n\\nIf you plan to convert to pesos, the ATM machines at local banks like Banamex or HSBC have excellent exchange rates (better than the currency exchange houses). Visa/MC also have good exchange rates, but many banks now charge an additional 2%-3% fee for foreign purchases in addition to the 1% that Visa/MC charges to do the conversion, which seems unreasonable to me considering the bank doesn\\'t add any value to the transaction process. Check your bank\\'s policy so that you are not surprised after the trip.\\n\\nSafety Tips:\\nEnsenada, unlike Tijuana, is a reasonably safe place to party and have a good time. Here are a few basic DON\\u2019Ts to stay clear of problems.\\n\\n1.) Don\\u2019t talk to the Raterios! These are the guys hanging out on the street that usually make an attempt to approach gringos looking for a good time. Most of them speak good English. They always act as if they are trying to help you find anything you may be looking for. Let me just call them what they are: hustlers. You will end up broke &amp; unhappy if you waste you time talking to them. They are smart and have a playbook of games. Just say no thanks or ignore them and keep walking. They don\\u2019t want to waste time either and will move on. \\n\\n2.) Don\\u2019t walk down any street in Ensenada with a drink in your hand.\\n\\n3.) Don\\u2019t bring or buy drugs period!!!!! \\n\\n4.) Don\\u2019t ever hit anyone or start a fight unless you want a tour inside of the local jail. \\n\\n5.) Don\\u2019t get so drunk that you can barely walk down the street.\\n\\n6.) Pedestrians have the right of way in the crosswalks, however you should still exercise caution before stepping out into the intersection.\\n\\nImportant Note About Street Beggars:\\nSome people may be shocked to see elderly women and young children begging (or selling gum), however be aware that the ones you see in the tourist zone are known to be exploited by a crime organizations who keep most of the money for themselves and chase away others who might have a legitimate need.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Avenida Lopez Mateos", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/10/41/2f/shops-and-restaurants.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Vinisterra_Vitivinicola-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California": {"619584444": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Good Wine, the visit was a let down", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d3267412-Reviews-Vinisterra_Vitivinicola-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/93/16/54/vinisterra.jpg", "datePublished": "September 25, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A friend recommended this Winery, upon 1st impression I liked the appearance of the winery.

There was some major disappointments. I understand that it\\'s Mexico and there are some basic luxuries that are absent but it kind of was ridiculous. We came from a cruise ship I would not recommend booking your excursion through the ship because you pay triple we walked off the cruise ship hopped on a bus paid $4 per person then went to downtown where we book the 2 were which was $17 per person down to La Buffadora.  The bus was nice enough and the tour guide was pretty good she did make some strange jokes about America which I felt were kind of like jabs saying look at those American standing outside of home depot waiting for work obviously not the case. Lebouf adores clearly a tourist trap designed to try to rip people off to buy junk from China which was disappointing.  We were hoping to really get a sample of the local culture however it was more like a flea market of junk and pushy merchants.\\n\\nYou weave your way through the streets and your letter by our tour guide which clearly has set this up to visit certain vendors and to promote their goods which I can understand the pina Colada drinks or delicious the charoses were good but all overpriced which again was disappointing. \\n\\nI was with kids and I felt safe the whole time however the merchants were very pushy and of course we ended up by in some small Knick knacks such as the guitar and some toys which were from China and the merchants lied about making from hand. Would you actually get down to the blowhole it really is nice and something to see but you have to go through the tourist traps of merchants.\\n\\nMembers of my party clearly had to use the restrooms and they charged 50 cents per person even the baby I was carrying. The explanation I got from the tour guide was they didn\\'t have running water so it justified them charging for the bathrooms but over all I just didn\\'t feel like I could trust anything they were saying because of the blatant lies that I had heard for most anything. \\n\\n We did stop at Habana banana and got the family package which costs over a $100 to have a meet and greet with the baby lions and Tigers. I felt it was worth it because when\\'s the last time you were able to do that in the States and so we thoroughly enjoyed that I wouldn\\'t do it every time in of course these told us it was 10 minutes in I was more close to 3 to 4 minutes that you got to be there with the the animals themself. \\n\\nThe highlight of the trip was at the very end of the merchants and they had a clam filled with shrimp and cheese 2 of them were $8 which was delicious and the baby Tigers along with the blow hole itself. \\n\\nA worthwhile visit I Would recommend going I just wouldn\\'t mess around with any of the merchants and don\\'t expect to be blown away by the experience. \\n\\nIf these merchants would just understand that if they offered quality products and were honest with there dealings they would end of making more money. I felt like they were just trying to RIP off every Tourist and milk them for every dollar they could.

All food is well seasoned, all salsas are fresh, and tortillas are made while you wait.  Each taco price ranges from $1.50-$2.00 dollars, U.S. monies.  Although other taco vendors are within the marketplace, none of them, out-cuisine this one.  \\n\\nSteamed clams with shrimp are at the end of the marketplace nearer the blowhole. Churros are along the pathway. Purchase churros from vendors that prepare in front of you. Why? Fresher and authentic ingredients.\\n\\nEssential information to know:\\nRestrooms are $1.00 everywhere within the La Bufadora marketplace.  You will receive toilet paper. Restrooms are typically clean/sanitized with soap and water.  However, take your hand sanitizer along with you.\\n\\nTake cash and avoid using credit/debit card.  I had 8 stacks of mixed bills in $20.00 increments with the money on my person rather than backpack/purse.  I felt completely safe, but as a tourist, I even caution against fellow tourists.\\n\\nWeather was about 60 degrees and brillant sun shine. We had on light jackets and thin long sleeve shirts. Too warm for hat, scarf, gloves and other un-necessities. We enjoyed the marketplace \\n11-2 p.m.\\n\\nIt is a marketplace and hustlers are all along the pathway. Rather than becoming irritable or repeating yourself, just smize (smile with your eyes) and keep walking.  The vendors just talk and bargain and are used to tourists ignoring them. Just, ignore with kindness. Many of the vendors are English and of course Spanish speaking. They all speak &quot;cash.&quot;  \\n\\nTips to keep the kiddos engaged: \\nI taught my daughter a few Spanish phrases to practice. I then taught her the 3 keys to bargaining when she wanted a neon backpack and not to accept first deal.  She mind as well practice early. Business transactions occur at all ages.In fact, she bargained the beautiful marble dominoes on my behalf. True, she impressed me.

The bus ride to La Bufadora is a little long, but there are plenty of sights along the way - especially as you near the coast.  While some may not like the gauntlet of vendors between the parking lot and La Bufadora, it does offer a lot of unique shopping and food options.  And the tequila tasting was a nice distraction.

No doubt she received a commission on purchases there, but we were happy about that.  We all wore labels that were provided with Michelle\\'s name on them so the vendors knew that we were part of a group.  \\n\\nThe tour group that was used through the cruise line was Misioneros Tours and as mentioned before, our tour guide was Michelle.

We recently took some friends to La Bufadora for their first time.  We have been there a number of times (driving ourselves or taking the tour off the cruise ship). This time we drove down and decided to look into other options. One was the public bus.  The other was a taxi.  After walking around, from our hotel to the bus terminal (in the heat and humidity), we flagged down a taxi. This is how we met Miguel.  What a great guy! He has now become our go to taxi when we return Ensenada.\\n\\nFor $60, Miguel took 4 adults to La Bufadora (from downtown Ensenada), waited 4 hours for us while we were at La Bufadora, then returned us to our hotel (we stayed at San Nicolas, nice hotel for the price).  \\nAn additional benefit with Miguel is that his English is excellent (he lived in California for some time). Our Spanish is barely passable, so English speaking drivers are good for us.  Don\\u2019t be afraid to ask him to stop for beer on the way. We stopped and bought him a soda and got us beers for the long ride (approximately 45 minute ride).  \\n\\nFor our traveling friends (on TripAdvisor), who are looking to have a safe and stress free experience, consider Miguel.  He will take good care of you.  Please take good care of him in return.  We asked how his business works, and was told he has to split 50/50 the net proceeds of all fares with the taxi company, but does get to keep his tips. \\n\\nAs for La Bufadora, bring lots of cash!!  There is a great deal of shopping to do, but most (if not all) only take cash.  We also have learned that the prices at La Bufadora (once negotiated to the lowest possible price) are better than you will find in town. Also, (my wife\\u2019s favorite part of a transaction) ask for a shot of tequila to close the deal.\\n\\nMiguel can be reached at:\\nEmail: miguel0angel169@gmail.com\\nCellphone: 011-52-646-195-1569\\n\\nEnjoy Ensanada and La Bufadora!\\n\\nD", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "607057657": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Shop lined street to the marine geyser", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "datePublished": "August 16, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is a tough one... the actual spout/ geyser is kinda neat.

Use the sanitarios/ bathrooms on the toll road. They are well cared for and clean.

(Not sure if it is more exciting arriving via other means...) We booked the \\u201cblowhole\\u201d tour with our cruise line. The signal to noise ratio is really low, meaning that the ride their, the walk through countless vendors to eventually get through the actual attraction doesn\\u2019t really justify the effort (and cost). Unless you love touristy places where souvenir shopping seems to be the main attraction and purpose of the place. \\nHowever, we were super lucky with our tour guide. A true Ensenadian, he gave a lot of insight about culture and living in Mexico. I found the 50 min rides (one way) the best of the entire tour because of our guide. He prepared us for all the vendors and pointed out a few of them that were noteworthy. He also explained the difference between fake silver and genuine silver. (Ask for an acid test!)\\n\\nMy take away is that we felt safe doing the cruise line excursion as opposed to getting around on our own. We got to see some back country life and the beautiful coast of Ensenada.\\n\\nWe could not avoid the \\u201cvendor shopping street\\u201d to get to the blow hole (and return back to the bus). But these vendors are just doing their job to survive and we were not annoyed by them and even bought some Schnickschnack.\\n\\nThe blowhole itself is spectacular but only if the tide schedule cooperates. We were 3 hours into receding (approximately four hours before low tide) and were able to see some spraying performances by the ocean. The sound this makes gave the tiny town of Bufadora it\\u2019s name. \\n\\nConclusion: \\nIf you are tired hanging out at your cruise ship, the tide schedule is in your favor, this perhaps is a good thing to do to kill a few hours and see some of the country.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "573583384": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Don\\u2019t go when it\\u2019s low tide..", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We went to La Bufadora twice during our stay in Ensenada, the first time wasn\\u2019t that great, it was low tide so you don\\u2019t even get wet or close to being wet.

We started our morning with a leisurely walk before a massage at Ensenada Massage. Then we hung out a little on First Street. Lastly, we decided to catch an Uber to La Bufadora. \\n\\nThe Trip There:\\n\\nThe ride was about a 45 minute drive from First Street. The entire ride was interesting for us. Our previous visit to Mexico was to Cozumel in the Caribbean so to see businesses such as Walmart, Sam\\'s Club, Costco, Applebee\\'s, Office Depot, Auto Zone, etc. in Ensenada was quite amusing. We saw homes and vendors and then the most amazing glimpses of the Pacific up winding roads as we neared our destination. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, we were &quot;greeted&quot; by vendors on both sides of the walkway to see the geyser. Keep walking if you don\\'t want to purchase anything, but if you do, you can find some pretty good buys. \\n\\nThen for the long awaited view, La Bufadora. What a beautiful sight! We took several pictures and had a great vantage point as it wasn\\'t too crowded the October Friday that we visited. The stronger the current, the higher the water shoots in the air.\\n\\nInteresting Facts:\\n\\n1. You have to pay 50 cent to use the on-site restroom. \\n\\n2. Our entire visit was adequate and less than an hour.\\n\\n3. You can get a pineapple pina colada refill for $2 instead of $3 if you bargain. :-)\\n\\nOur Uber driver agreed to wait for us for about 45 minutes while we walked around for a return trip of $20 USD (this included the wait time). \\n\\nNote: Be sure to check your final costs. Our original cost was quoted at $243 pesos (about $13 USD) and ended up costing us about $317 pesos (about $17 USD). Though the amount wasn\\'t vastly different in dollars, this was not the original amount quoted in Uber. I didn\\'t realize until after our ride and looking back at he app. The cost was still cheaper than the $50 round trip taxi ride, however.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "529289401": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Always fun to see", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "If you want a true tourist destination, it doesn\\'t get more touristy than La Bufadora.

Not bad, considering that they guard your vehicle for you. There are many vendors and little restaurants along the long street you have to go down to get to the La Bufadora.  Each vendor tries to convince you to visit their shop. They speak English &amp; some are quite humorous in their attempts to convince you to visit their store. There were a number of strollers to rent, which we didn\\'t need, but in case whoever is reading needs one. We saw a pretty squirrel scampering around near the La Bufadora. We bought some churros there (our local friends told us to ask them to make a fresh, hot batch for us and they kindly did so, upon our request) and then we stopped for yummy tamales, at a roadside stand, on the way back to Ensenada.

I guess we were there at high tide or close to it - the water at times was shooting up to the top of the rocks and getting everyone wet - very impressive and lots of fun. Once I was there my family and I were happy we went. There are two trails, a lower one where you may get wet, and a higher trail that will give you a more complete view. You drove all this way so might as well take the short hike to the top (less than 5 mins- called &quot;El Mirador&quot; on signs) as well and take in the great view.  Also as others have stated, once you park it is about 10 min walk through a line of shops. Yes the vendors will try selling to you and the prices are more expensive than in town, but if you do not want to buy anything just ignore the vendors and they will leave you alone.

It is a natural water spout that, every 7 seconds, shoots ocean water from a cave under the mountain to way up high in the air.  It is absolutely beautiful and well worth the trip to see.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t take a tour through the cruise ship because these are usually way over-priced.  When we came off the cruise ship, there was a bus right there to take us to the town shopping area.  Aboard that bus, they had an offer for a tour to La Bufadora for $15 each, which is what we took.  It is about 20 miles on a nice bus to La Bufadora, one of Ensenada\\'s most famous landmarks, and it takes about 40 minutes each way, and is a beautiful drive.  Our tour guide, Juanita, was very informative about the sights we were seeing on the way and the history of the area.  When we arrived, the bus unloaded us at a wonderful restaurant (&quot;Tacos al Bufadora&quot; - FANTASTIC TACOS - NOT TO BE MISSED!).  This was at the beginning of a 1/4 mile walk to the actual blowhole.  It is sort of like walking a gauntlet because there are about 200 flea market type stalls on both sides with very aggressive male vendors trying to get you to come into their shops and buy their goods.  I finally had to tell one guy, &quot;DO NOT TOUCH ME!&quot;  I did do some shopping but mostly in shops run by females because the men were a little scary. I don\\'t mean that I felt I was in danger of being harmed or kidnapped (it\\'s way too public for anything like that) - I just don\\'t care for high pressure sales and this was definitely high pressure and &quot;in-your-face&quot;.  Many of the shops are just repeats of each other but our tour guide tried to steer us toward the right places.  She warned us about fake silver jewelry and how to tell the difference and actually took us to a store that gave a demonstration.  She also warned us about the stores that carry :&quot;designer&quot; brands... that are really low quality knockoffs.  One store I went into had a fake Michael Kors purse I asked about and the guy wanted something like $300 for a fake!  And he didn\\'t volunteer that it was a fake and when I called him on it, he said, &quot;Yea, but if it were real, it would be $800!&quot;  Like that was supposed to make it ok. Sheesh!  Anyway, it is definitely BUYER BEWARE here.  Any price they give you, you SHOULD bargain down - offer about 1/2 or less.  Be ready to walk away because they have the same stuff at another 20+ stores down the line. I bought a few items - mostly pharmaceuticals and tote bags - stuff like that.  There\\'s another restaurant right near the blowhole that has great seafood, and another place near the beginning that has awesome Pina Colada smoothies (spiked and non-spiked).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "459339577": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "The blow hole was amazing", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I was with a group of friends on a cruise which stopped in Ensenada.

It was fun to see and the water certainly does spray high into the air.  It is recommended if you have a couple of hours free to explore outside the center of Ensenada.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "449680493": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Christmas Season Tour to La Bufadora, Family of 9", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We were aboard the Grand Princess cruise and booked their tour package, 2 buses loaded with about 50 people each. We drove about 45 minutes from the pier through the city and up a cliff drive to La Bufadora. The blowhole is located high on a hill so if you have fear of heights you may not want to look out the window during the 15 to 20 minute portion of the cliff drive.\\n\\nAfter arriving we walked through an extremely long path of vendors to get to the blowhole. Just call it the &quot;vendor gauntlet&quot;. The vendors are the most aggressive we\\'ve seen in the ports of call we\\'ve visited in Mexico. Many of them offer churros, drinks, candy or nut samples and beg you to come into their shops. They will stand in front of you without moving and gesture with their arms misdirecting your path. My father was annoyed by it, my kids aged 11 and 14 were fascinated by all the activity. To each their own. Our tour guide had told us to make it to the blowhole first and stop and shop afterwards so we powered on to the end. Good advice.\\n\\nIt\\'s an interesting phenomenon, the blowhole. Water comes into a sea cave and blows mist high into the air. Depending on the tide you\\'ll see variations of how high the water will shoot out. We got some good sprays when we were there. The kids had fun waiting and watching for it. You hear a loud sound before the actual mist so they anticipated hearing the booming of the waves into the rocks. \\n\\nIt was very crowded when we went and it was difficult to get a good viewing spot to watch. Bring your patience if it\\'s crowded. You\\'ll have to wait for people to drift away from the viewing walls. On the way back up the gauntlet there is a restroom you can use for 50 cents. They have to cart the water in as there is no water source and it\\'s not very clean but if you\\'re desperate it will have to do. \\n\\nWe did get some churros for $2 a bag on the way back through. They were very tasty and the kids loved them. We also stopped by the taco shop right by the parking lot because I had seen great reviews for it. They did taste great and were on freshly made tortillas that were pressed right in front of you so that was fun to watch. They were $2 each, $3 if you wanted cheese. There\\'s 3 kinds of salsa you can add and if you want guacamole there\\'s no extra charge. I thought it was reasonable, my husband said they may as well have been priced in California. Again, to each their own.\\n\\nThe sunset on the way back the ship was beautiful and overall it was a nice trip. Not overly exciting but pleasant. The kids had the most fun and there isn\\'t much else to see in Ensenada so it worked for our family.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "448608208": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A long way to go for a very little pay off....", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "First, It is beautiful and a very interesting piece of coast line, like much of the other cost line along the Mexican Coast.

I thought we were at the blowhole at this spot. Some people came by and told us the best is still to come. We walked a little but further to find this absolute gem. The blowhole comes every couple minutes and you can hear it coming.

I believe that our taxi was $45.00 for the two of us and included him waiting for us to get through the flea market and blow hole. I would defentialy recommend going this route.

You are not allowed to take any pictures of the cats unless you pay.\\n\\nThe shop owners bombard you with samples (churros, margaritas, nuts, etc) in order to try and get you into their shops.

We had GPS so it was easy to navigate our way to the sights.  It takes 45 minutes to 60 minutes one way to get to La Bufadora. We stopped along the way and took some beautiful pics of the coast line and we stopped and got some homemade tamales.  The tamale stands are everywhere,  but I recommend you have smaller USD or pesos as they are cheap; $1 USD per tamale. The stands don\\'t typically have alot of change. Once you get to La Bufadora there is a flea market where you can barter. Again they all take USD or pesos so bring lots of small bills.  You can get cheap drinks,  snacks and Mexico items here. Definitely barter! Several stands will say they are hand painted, etc. Not many truly are, so don\\'t let them fool you. We got things like leather sandals for $7 USD, alcohol drinks for $3, a hammock for $20 USD, etc. REMEMBER CASH, because they will want to charge you 15% at the places that accept credit cards!! Be warned! The blowhole is at the end of the flea market.  It\\'s beautiful,  but often crowded,  especially if you get there at the same time a cruise tour arrives. I think it\\'s worth the drive.  There are several local Mexican restaurants throughout Ensenada,  but many authentic restaurants don\\'t have  English speakers.

The blow hole is located about an hour away from where the cruise ships dock.  You can almost see to the area where it is located by scanning the shore line to the south as it makes a curve around the peninsula. At the far end you will see the hillside get higher right at the end of the peninsula and just on the other side of that is where La Bufadora is located (so I would not try and make it there on your own).  But if you wish to save over half the price charged by the cruise take the shuttle busses in front of the cruise terminal that take you into town and they will offer you the trip for much less than the cruise line.  Also, based on how long the tour from the cruise shows you will have much more time if you take the tour from the shuttle company.  But, be mindful of the time as this tour takes over 4 hours and you do not want to get left behind by the ship.  Now the part that may turn off some people, to get from the parking area at La Bufadora to the \\u2018actual\\u2019 blow hole you have to traverse between a quarter and half mile of vendors hawking everything from candy and leather goods to pharmaceuticals. There are also several restaurants along the way in case you get hungry.  Now once you get to the end of the road it will really depend on how the tide is at that time which determines how forceful the water shoots up.  Basically every time the tide surges in the water is forced up the blow hole and onto the rocks just opposite the viewing area.  Sometimes you get a big splash and sometime nothing at all.  On the way the escort told us that there were not very many blow holes in the world, so if you wish to view something rare you might enjoy a trip to La Bufadora.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "391906444": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "This is a fun place to go see, where the gyser that is shooting up and great for fotos.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Coming to see the Bufadora there are many little places to buy things, I recommend the drink in the cocunuts  they are delicious.

What I do is walk down and visit many shops and don\\u2019t buy anything but jot down the prices. The on my return, I know where to stop and what I want. A word of advice, it would really help to know some Spanish as the prices are significantly lower of you know Spanish. Also, the vendors are sometimes pushy so just be ready. All you have to do is say no gracias. Some people get nervous and start shouting filthy racist obscenities. They are just trying to make a living so be courteous and just say no gracias.\\nThe other half of the fun is trying to get pics of the blow hole and listen to everyone oooohhhh and awwwwwee when a large gush of water reaches massive heights. It\\u2019s a natural wonder and simply amazing. The weather is always nice and the people are friendly. If you have to use the restroom, pay in pesos as the price is half of what you pay if you pay in US currency.

We were on a Christmas cruise last December and took the shuttle from our ship into town.  Instead of spending about $59 for an excursion which could be purchased on the ship, we spent a mere $15 on a local tour bus out to La Bufadora.  The bus ride took about an hour passing through the run-down outskirts of town and finally some scenic views of the Pacific ocean.  We had an excellent guide on the bus informing us about the area before we arrived at the blowhole.  He also mentioned that we would find &quot;boutique shops&quot; after we got off the bus.  \\n\\nAfter walking past the &quot;junk shops&quot;, we found a spot to view the famous eruption.

We planned on walking First Street and maybe hitting a beach.  On our bus to downtown as we saw the condition of downtown Ensenada (not necessarily the most inviting) and jumped at the chance to take a discounted excursion from the tour company operating the shuttle bus.  For $52/ea we got both the zipline excursion at Las Canadas and a stop at La Bufadora.  The cruise ship probably sells the same excursion for $125 - $150, so it pays to book outside of the cruise ship!\\n\\nLa Bufadora is what it is -- it is a fun and unique natural wonder.  The drive is a bit long as you wind your way from Highway 1 out to the peninsula on the Pacific.  But the views of the Pacific are gorgeous, and the blowhole itself unique.  \\n\\nThe flea market is definitely not as good of a deal as you might get in other markets in Mexico.  It is definitely a bit of a \\'tourist trap\\'.  Our guide for the day was a very nice, articulate and fun guy as our host, but there was little doubt that he gets his beak wet based upon his shop recommendations.  That said, if you negotiate hard enough (did a great act with my stepdaughter on a fake Louis Vuitton bag purchase -- &quot;We have to leave NOW!&quot;) you can get some good deals on the typical flea market fare.\\n\\nThere is this really cool bar/restaurant that has live big cats that you can touch, pet and put cubs on your lap for pictures.  I was very tempted, but after exploring the blowhole, shopping, eating and drinking we just didn\\'t take the time to seriously consider it.......but it looked AWESOME.\\n\\nGreat tacos at the taco place right at the entrance to the flea market.

Driving out there to the tip of the peninsula reminds me of some areas in Hawaii.  I say this because of the big steep mountains coming down to the ocean.  I recommend going in April/May which is right after rainy season because the mountains will be very green and much prettier.  The other thing is to know when high tide and low tide are.  If you go during low tide the blow hole does not really blow anymore.  So try and find out when high tide will be there and plan your trip around that.  If you like flea market type shopping for tourist keepsakes then you will enjoy all of the shopping on the walk down to the blow hole.

To use their bathrooms located at the flea market/blow hole area, you will pay them 50 cents.  The restrooms are clean and by paying them you are helping support the local economy.  There is a MUST VISIT eatery - Lidia\\'s Tacos that are to die for.  They are fish, shrimp, carne asada and more for $1.50 - $2.50 a taco and sooooo good.  She is located near the dirt parking area.  You will not be sorry.  The blow hole was active for our visit and the views of the beautiful water around is BEAUTIFUL. The blowhole can be anywhere from 10-100 feet high at times, depending on the tides. Glad we came and encourage you to as well.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "340098130": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nice view and pleasant ride along the coast", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The water spray and sound  were  impressive due to the high surf but had it been a normal day, I think I would have been disappointed.

I would recommend making purchases on your way walking back up the street so you do not get everything wet or have to carry everything twice (down then back up the street).  Vendors were all friendly, some take American money, most take only pesos.  Food was good to snack on.  \\n\\nI definitely recommend La Bufadora.  It is also a great place for photos, fun videos when your friends and family get splashed (make sure to protect your phone or camera and any other electronics!), and overall a great place to pick up some gifts.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "332756857": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Average Waterfront Attraction", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "La Buradora is a rocky beach front which means crashing waves and lot of splashing.

There are not really any places at the cruise port to shop, so you need to go to downtown Ensenada to do any shopping/touring. You can take the 15/20 minute walk or there is a bus that will take you there for $2 per person. Once we got on this bus, the tour guide presented us with several other tours (wine tour, horseback riding, zip lining, or La Bufadora) that they offered which were a fraction of the price of the cruise ship excursions.\\n\\nI really wanted to go on the zip lining/suspension bridge tour but I had a bad cold/sinus infection and didn\\'t think I could handle the strenuous activity involved. Our second choice was the La Bufadora marine geyser (blow hole). From what I read, I didn\\'t know if it would be worth the time but it was only $15pp, so we went with it. \\n\\nIt took around 45 minutes to get from downtown Ensenada to La Bufadora. We were able to see the beautiful area and our tour guide (Alberto?) was great! He was very knowledgeable about the area and told us so many things about the area that we would not have know about had we skipped out on the tour.  The blow hole was neat but the size of the water geyser depends on the strength of the waves, so the effect is different each time you visit. \\n\\nTo get to the blowhole, you have to walk through an open air flea market. The vendors were very pushy and although I never felt unsafe, they did make me uncomfortable. So much so that I was not looking forward to walking back through the crowd to get to the bus. When we went back through the vendors were still pushy but not as bad as the first time. After we went in to shop at a few different stands, I felt much more at ease. Don\\'t buy anything at the price they are asking. Our tour guide said they are open to negotiating price and will usually take 25-30% less than what they are asking.\\n\\nThe highlight of our trip was this amazing taco stand in the parking lot. They had fried fish tacos, shrimp tacos, carne asada tacos, and chicken tacos for $1.50 to $3 each. I am not lying when I say these were THE BEST TACOS that I\\'ve ever had in my entire life.

However, the show we got was good. You have to wait for a few smaller jets of water before you get one of the full effect sprays. An interesting natural experience, but with no fee. There is parking on the way down to the area, but getting through the street traffic is very time consuming.\\n\\nAnd, speaking of time consuming, the walk down to La Bufadora is quite long (not measured), but be wary of prices at the multitude of shops! We saw the same item offered at one end of the shop walk at 4 times the price as another place. My suggestion is to &quot;window shop&quot; on the way down to La Bufadora and ask about prices, then stop at the best price stores on the way back up the road. And, be sure to bargain! Never, ever pay full price, and half their first offer!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "314307291": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nice sightseeing opportunity", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "In order to get to La Bufadora, you need to take a boat ride out to Todos SNtos Island.

I went on a cruise and since Ensenada was one of the stops, La Bufadora was one of the excursions available. We chose a zip lining excursioin, but La Bufadora was added to that excursion. I get that it\\'s a natural phenomenon and that there are only a few natural geysers in the world. That\\'s cool. However, this stop has to be the biggest tourist trap in Ensenada! The guides will walk you through the shops and point out ones they recommend. I think all the guides make deals with certain shops and get a cut when someone from their tour (they want you to wear stickers with their name on them so he/she can identify you as part of their group) buys something. Of course you get a &quot;discount&quot; because you\\'re part of &quot;xyz\\'s&quot; group. The bufadora itself is ok to see. You see it puff up a few times, take a few pictures, and then there\\'s not much more. LOL. So at this point you have to make your way back through the shopping area and all the vendors trying to sell you their wares. If you\\'ve never been to Mexico before - or are looking for gifts, this is for you. For those of us that have been before and/or live in So. Cal, you\\'ll see the same stuff you can get in downtown LA. (LOL). It\\'s Mexico, so make sure you haggle for price. The best part of the area is the taco stand at the parking lot. Pricing is pretty much US taco prices ($1.25+ per taco) - but in a tourist trap like this it\\'s expected. Tacos were awesome. So if you\\'re doing another excursion and this is part of it - go for it. Just be aware of what the scene is. If you\\'re wanting to do this as it\\'s own excursion - make sure you like shopping. You\\'ll spend 10-15 minutes checking out La Bufadora - then you\\'ll have to kill the time shopping until your designated departure time. If you DO chose this as it\\'s own excursion off a cruise - don\\'t buy it on the ship. It\\'s cheaper at the shuttle terminal.

The first review will be from the eyes of a first timer that has rarely been out of the country. The second half of the review is my opinion as a seasoned traveler that has seen much worse areas in Mexico and other countries. \\nIf you have never (rarely) been out of the USA, then the poverty viewed on the bus ride to La Bufadora will probably open your eyes a little. These people do not live well. They need to work hard for each and every penny and this is obvious as you look out the windows during the air conditioned bus trip. From the second that you enter the half flea market, half circus atmosphere that is unavoidable during your short walk to see the blowhole, you will be bombarded with sales people attempting to get you to buy buy buy. They know that they have only about 90 minutes of your attention to make an aggressive sales pitch. As soon as you reach the end of the street, your tour guide points to the blowhole and releases you allowing you to take a few pictures and then attempt to navigate the gauntlet of hawkers on your own as you work your way back to the bus. There are restaurants that offer toilets to patrons, but everyone else needs to pay to use the public facilities ($.50).\\nNow to be fair, this was not my first time here. Over thirty years ago, I walked this same street. It was not paved at that time and the sanitation was no where near what it is today. The sales people were much less polite and you truly felt lucky to be leaving blowhole (hell-hole as I called it). Today it is cleaner, more civilized, and a simple &quot;no thank you&quot; works perfectly. The blowhole is really just an excuse to attract people to the market.

(Tickets were purchased in Plaza Pueblo Antiguo)\\n\\nWe had a tour guide of sorts tell us all about where we were driving by as it took us about 45 minutes to get out there.

You need to have bigger surf before it does much of anything more than a spray. It is still one of only a few in the world, or so they tell us on the trip to it. It is though, at least, one of the largest blowholes in North America, so for this reason alone, it is a should see.\\n\\nThe boring part come from getting to the blowhole, or at least from coming back from the blowhole. Let me explain, the parking is up the hill and about a 1/4 mile from the actual viewing area. To get to it, you have to walk past vendors selling everything from churros to clothing to Silver to pharmacies (mostly selling \\u201cgeneric\\u201d Viagra) and even a few sit down restaurants. As you walk down people offer you free food and drink samples and ask you to come into their shops to see what they have to offer. After a few shops you start to notice that most of the shops are selling the exact same things as the shops you have already passed.\\n\\nSo you finally make it past the gantlet and to the viewing area for the blowhole. Now you notice all the people, like you, that have come to view it. As the blowhole is rather small, you have to try to find a place where you can actually see it and have to wait for the people that got there before you to leave before you can get a good viewing spot. So after 15-30 minutes you finally get to a good viewing spot (warning! On cruise ship days, the wait can be very long as over a thousand people may be here) and have to wait for that perfect ocean surge to come and make the blowhole blow. When it does, you get to see a 50 foot \\u2013 100 foot blast of water come shooting out of the cavern below, you cannot actually see the blowhole without climbing on the rocks and taking your life in your hands. Oh, the blowhole also makes a thundering sound when it blows and this is very cool.\\n\\nNow comes the pain, you have to walk back up the 1/4 mile street and see all the same people trying to sell you stuff, but this time, they know that they will never see you again, so this is their last time to sell you something. They get very pushy and stand in your way to make you stop. The trip back to the parking lot is pure hell if you cannot just ignore the vendors and push on by.\\n\\nThere is a bit of haven though once you make it back to the top of the street. On the north side of the street, there is a small sit down taco restaurant that has some of the best taco\\u2019s I, and my family agreed, have ever had any place in the world. The Tortillas are handmade, the meats and perfectly spiced, the fish is very fresh and the toppings are plentiful and varied. Oh, and the prices are CHEAP! I will go back here just for the tacos and leave! I think it named &quot;Paleteria y Neveria La Michoacan&quot;, but it is on the right as you go down and on the left as you come back. It is at the very begging and has white plastic tables and chairs.

As another reviewer mentioned, from the dirty parking lot, you walk through a gauntlet of merchants that are all selling the same crappy souvenirs.  I think we were offered no less than ten samples of pina coladas in as many steps.  I knew we were in trouble when our tour guide spent most of the 50 minutes to get there telling us how NOT to get ripped off.  Of course, they were in cahoots with all the so called &quot;legitimate&quot; merchants, and had no problem pointing them out as we walked along the pushy stall owners.  I decided to test one of those merchants as I often buy silver from a New Zealand operation that gets its jewelry from Mexico and Bali.  Even with the alleged 50% off, the piece was overpriced and I told him so.  When I was walking out he yelled that the price would be $35 if I paid cash, a long ways away from the $95 price tag seconds ago.  I waived him off and left.  After getting back to the shops at the cruise terminal I found a beautiful pendant, with no pressure sales tactics.  I just asked if there was a discount, and she said yes.  I am so so glad I purchased something there, as I did not want to support the circus at La Bufadora.\\n\\nAnyway, it was a good day for the blow hole as we saw a couple huge sprays.  The scenery is gorgeous but we had been on the coast for awhile at Big Sur, so it wasn\\'t as dramatic.  I was appalled to see two lion cubs and a monkey in cages all for the opportunity to take pictures with these poor creatures.  The cubs were so young, they must have been yearning for their mother\\'s comfort.  I understand trying to make a living, but selling fake designer goods, bad silver, and stealing animals from their environment is just down right cruel.  The tour guide also insisted that the restaurant she highly recommended served only authentic Mexican Food that you could not find in the heart of Ensenada.  Well that was another deception, as the place was as touristy as could be and had a menu that looked like Denny\\'s only offering more Tex/Mex styled food.

It was then possible to perch yourself at the observation deck above the blowhole with a dozen or so others for an intimate experience with a unique marine geyser.\\n\\nWhat an experience it is! Air is trapped in a network of coves &amp; underwater caves at the base of a cliff. Depending on the tide and size of the waves, water shoots up through a hole every minute or so. It is really loud, and can reach heights of 50\\'.\\n\\nThe twisting ride to La Bufadora - at the tip of the Punta Banda peninsula - is fantastic, with sweeping vistas of the ocean &amp; nearby hills. Figure 45 minutes from downtown Ensenada. At the very end of the road, you see a arch welcoming you to La Bufadora. Parking can range from $2 to $10. There\\'s an OXXO kwickie-mart at the entrance if you need anything.\\n\\nThen you must walk a half-mile gauntlet of vendors hawking stuff you mostly don\\'t need. Some of it is pretty colorful - the guy with the python, the farmacias hawking &quot;Free Viagra with purchase of Prozac!&quot;, caged lion cubs, cocos frios, a sea of lucha libre wrestling masks - but it gets repetitive, cheesy. Some of the hawkers were too aggressive for my taste. A few restaurants &amp; bars looked inviting, as did some of the stands selling nuts &amp; sweets.\\n\\nAs you near the end, you hear the thunder of La Bufadora before you see it. There are several places to witness it (including climbing out over the railing onto the wet rocks right above it...not too bright). You can get pretty wet when the spray &amp; wind conspire. I was there twice recently. At 9:45 a.m., the place was nearly empty. By 1 pm, it was 4-deep at the choice viewing spots, mostly turistas. Probably cruise ship shore excursions. Go early. Free admission; banos are 50 pesos.\\n\\nBest way to experience La Bufadora? Kayak. During my recent trip, I rented a sit-atop sea kayak from Dale\\'s Dive Shop. $25 for 2 hours, which was plenty of time to see this breath-taking natural wonder from an upclose &amp; personal vantage point.\\n\\nNot easy to find, Dale\\'s is located to the south of the arch. I don\\'t think he keeps regular hours, so make reservations. You can park by the campground for free. A concrete boat launch is down the hill. \\n\\nThe half-mile paddle across the bay was eye-popping, but tough due to the heavy seaweed. The water is super clear, considering its proximity to the Pacific\\'s open water. I paddled out to a bird nesting area covered in guana which looked like snow. Head around the point, and you hear, see and feel La Bufadora in all of its splendor. I approached it along the rocky foot of the hill to its north, and probed some of the coves &amp; inlets seen by few. Crystal clear water, heavy turbulence. \\n\\nI stroked right up to the base of La Bufadora. Amazing. You can better grasp how it works and how darned high the water goes. You see hundreds of visitors about 60\\' above you, many waving, filming, yelling. The thunder of La Bufadora is best felt right here.\\n\\nAfter 30 minutes, I explored the area just south of the waterspout where the waves got really rough; a cauldron with jagged rocks. Not for beginners. Then I headed out to open water, where the waves were really rockin\\'. I circled some rocky islands, then headed back across the seaweed-clogged bay, doing more sweeping with my paddle across the surface than stroking. \\n\\nThe exit was challenging, with a tough current &amp; serious waves by the shore. The round rocks on the beach make a applauding sound each time a wave hits; they should have held their applause for my landing (took several tries).\\n\\nYeah, the area around La Bufadora is more touristy, parking isn\\'t free and the view can by marred by cruise ship passengers wielding selfie-sticks, but La Bufadora is still a unique and memorable experience.

Quite a juxtaposition.  \\n\\nAlso, there are no public restrooms available for use at no charge. You can pay to use a restroom - the cost is generally 50 cents.

One was to have a look at the blowhole at La Bufadora but also to experience the Sip Lining at the Ensenada Camping Ground.\\n\\nA word of warning that Ensenada is a very poor Mexican City. Some passengers on our cruise ship remained on board as they had previously experienced the port and found it as a port that they didn\\'t want to experience again. I guess from our point of view you will experience beggars in the street and this is quite common. It is sad that to see and I feel those less fortunate. Despite that issue the main part of the town is quite vibrant and if you have the greenback you can sit back and have a lot of fun. Music, food and the occasional drink. The city is duty free. I bought a beautiful wooden chess set for my grandson for $15, he is still trying to teach me how to play.\\n\\nBe very aware of people approaching you and offering private vehicles for transport around the district. They wait for passengers coming of the cruise ships and offer private transportation. Mexico has a regulated cab system and that is the Yellow Cabs.  You still have to negotiate the price for your journey, but the Yellow Cab System provides safety for tourists.\\n\\nWe grabbed No 22 and I why I mention this particular cab is the cab driver was a very honest person and a grandfather. We were travelling with our two grandchildren and this guy just treated the kids like they were his own. We felt very safe with this cab driver. We negotiated our price for our tour and had one of the most informative and beautiful tours around the district including the Blowhole and the sip lines at the camping ground. For 4 hours we paid $50 USD. Use the Yellow Cabs and not the private companies that are not insured and are a bit risky when it comes to payment or if you have an accident you may not be insured.\\n\\nThe blowhole is one of the best in the world and whilst we arrived on a calm day it was firing up 40-50 in the air. It is understood from the locals that on heavy seas, it can reach up to 150 feet in the air.  We still got very wet but enjoyed every experience.\\n\\nOn the walk down to the blowhole are individual market owners and most are selling the same tourist items. Negotiate hard with anything you want to buy because the traders go very high but with some negotiation they will come down at least 50% of the asking price. I bought beautiful leather belts with an asking price of $40 down to $20.  These were pure leather and not imitation and they will last for 15-20 years they are such high quality. I would normally $60-$70 for the same quality at home.\\n\\nThe zip lines are a camp ground that is on the same road to the blowhole. From a taxi point of view it is 15 minutes from the blowhole.\\n\\nYou have to pay an entrance fee that is refundable if you exit the park within two hours. We have read some negative stories about Mexican Taxi Drivers, use common sense, use your heart and you will experience Mexico. There is a beautiful water play ground for the kids and this is part of the park admission. There are four zip lines and these costs about $20USD. Height and age restrictions do apply and basically you need to be 48 inches. Quite fun and a great experience.\\n\\nEnsenada is a very dry hot place during the summer months with water restrictions, the winter is the only time it rains and it is a place you can visit on a short term, you probably want to take lots of photos and it is one of those places that I have been there done that lets move on.\\n\\nI would not discourage any one from visiting the place, make it short, make it safe and have a great holiday.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "234207491": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "So much fun!

Instead of opting for one of the cruises\\' planned excursions, I chose to take the non-affiliated shuttle bus tour to La Bufadora. I don\\'t remember the name of the shuttle company, but they say they cater to the tourists coming off cruise ships everyday. It\\'s a $3/person ride to a stop in town where you decide what trip options you want to take next. I chose just the $15/person trip to La Bufadora w/o the options for horseback riding or zip lining. Who knew that it actually took 40-45 min just to get to the site itself. We had a terrific guide, Ignacio, who explained Ensenada and its history along the ride.\\n\\nThankfully there\\'s not another charge to see La Bufadora. Our group walks straight to the sight through the flea market, before doing any shopping or eating. I got there around 11 am on a Wednesday, and it wasn\\'t too crowded. Saw the waves crash up a handful of times--it happens pretty often. You can almost tell when to expect a big crash coming. It\\'s fairly exciting for the first few times. Then, I strolled back towards the parking lot while shopping and trying to buy a straw hat at a bargained price. I also ate cheesy baked clams and some fish tacos, a must for coastal Mexican food. \\n\\nCould easily spend the day getting here, shopping, eating and then traveling back to make it back on the ship by early afternoon. \\n\\nP.S.

It is known as the blowhole.  Ocean water comes in with the tide, hits the rocks and shoots water up in the air from air pressure that gets trapped between the rocks underneath and the water on top.  Sometimes the water gets people standing around the top wet, but usually, the tide isn\\'t big enough to be very exciting.\\n\\nWhile this was the original attraction, people built restaurants and makeshift stores around it.  The food is okay, and the prices are relatively cheap.  \\n\\nFor me, the experience is fun when you are shopping for souvenirs for friends and family, and you get to barter with people selling stuff.  After a while, it can be overwhelming.  Most of the stuff is cheap, low quality stuff that you really don\\'t want, but sounds cool while you\\'re there!  Word to the wise:  the &quot;Cuban&quot; cigars they sell aren\\'t really Cuban cigars, so don\\'t blow your wad on fake stuff.  Stick to things you can put a value on.  We have purchased many things- from seashell mirrors, to toys, to shoes.  Most of the watches and silver there are fake as well, so shop carefully.  Don\\'t be afraid to engage with people in negotiations.  It\\'s part of the culture, and if done right, can benefit you and the seller.  \\n\\nThe churros and pina coladas are all great!  Refills on Pina Coladas are $2 if you keep the pineapple the drink comes in.  We were brave last time we went and tried the clams which were also great!  \\n\\nAlso, there is a kiosk where you can take pictures with baby lions and tigers.  The money raised supposedly goes to supporting a reservation where the larger cats go when they are too wild to take pictures with.  After visiting, we checked online, and we couldn\\'t verify whether the people who run that kiosk are really a charity or not, but they are seemingly exploiting these young animals, and when they get too big, instead of putting them on a reservation, they kill them.  Its a great photo opportunity, but we no longer support these people based on what we have read.  \\n\\nParking at La Bufadora is 25 pesos or $2.  Using the bathrooms will cost 50 cents or 5 pesos.  \\n\\nThere are many samples of food, and its a beautiful drive up a mountain along the ocean to get there.

It was about 30 minutes from town.  There is a portion of the road where its still dirt and a tad bit rough but luckily Ensenada is working on making the road paved completely.  When we got there we saw the flea market which extended for blocks down the pathway to La Bufadora - the blowhole.  You will get bombarded by vendors wanting you to try their pina coladas and churros claiming each one makes the best.  I probably had 10 samples of pina coladas and a half dozen churro samples.  All good and each vendors tasted the same.  Anyways you walk through the flea market dealing with agressive vendors each wanting you to visit their store.  Our tour guide told us which stores to go in. He probably got a kick back of some sort from each vendor because at the end of our trip here he was drunk.  Everyone gave him shots of Tequila or whatever.  Anyways, the sellers will always start the prices off very high.  Offer them 60% less what they are quoting you.  If they don\\'t budge, don\\'t worry there is a vendor that is selling the same thing in the next booth.  Don\\'t believe that anything is designer whether its watches, purses, etc. THEY ARE ALL FAKE!  If you have the patience and know how to deal, it can be alot of fun and very rewarding knowing you got a great deal.  As for eating, I recommend the fish tacos at the first stand on the right as you enter the flea market.  The last taco stand is also very good.  They have these clams topped with cheese and pico di gallo that are fabulous.  I believe it was 3 large clams for $9.  Very very good!

It boggles my mind why this is a stop. But more on that later. Once you get off the ship there is a small shopping area at the terminal and next to that there are shuttles waiting to take you into Ensenada for shopping and dining.  Once on the shuttle the staff really push the tour to the Bufadora. The way they talk about it you would think it is heaven on earth. So we decided to give it a shot this time.  Instead of falling for the prices the tour company charges for the Bufadora trip I hired my own cab driver who charged about half what the tour company charged.  Our cab was clean and the driver was friendly. Our driver did stop at the Corona bottling plant and we purchased a couple of beers for the road. This was a nice touch. When we got to the Bufadora area, our driver asked us how long we would be and I told him to meet us in two hours. We then began walking down the street that leads to this attraction. There was shop after shop with vendors yelling out to you as you walked by hoping to make a sale. All of the shops seem to carry the same items. There were t-shirts galore. Candy. Leather goods. We stopped at a few shops and the vendors were not in the bartering mood. I saw a t-shirt I liked and the vendor wanted 20 dollars.  I said that I would give him 15 and he rejected it. So we moved on.  When we got to the bufadora at the end of the street I was really disappointed. It snorted and blew a little water but nothing spectacular.  There were also restrooms oddly located right next to this attraction. And they charged to use them.  We then decided to try a restaurant located near this attraction and found the place to be empty. I had to shout out to see if anyone was working there. Finally someone came out and seated us. The food was okay. There were some decent ocean views from there but the place felt old and rundown.  We made our way back up the road and met our cab driver. He said &quot;already done.&quot; I said &quot;yep, I have seen enough.&quot;   We will not be back.  I am not sure why the cruise ships stop in Ensenada anymore. There is really nothing to do there. The town is removed from the ocean and it is just like any other place to get a beer and eat a taco.

When we leave a ship, and take the shuttle to town, we are offered a tour to the blowhole and flea market at La Bufadora.  The trip takes about 45 min by bus, usually narrated by an English-speaking resident of Ensenada, often a college student.  The narrators are often funny, and very informative.  The 45 minute drive goes through Ensenada, past the Plaza de los Tres Cabezas (Plaza of the three heads) which honors three heroes of Mexican Independence with huge statues of their heads.\\n\\nThe ride is past the manufacturing district, much expanded and quite modern since NAFTA, then miles of lush farming land and olive groves, then past beautiful beaches and eventually rising up by the coastline toward the mountains, which are quite lovely.  You also see the &quot;gringo gulch&quot; developments of houses for expat Americans who have homes here.  \\n\\nAt the end of the drive, your bus pulls into a shopping area, a huge flea market with all kinds of stalls selling ceramics, stained glass, leather, knockoff designer purses, handwoven cloth purses, clothing, and the ubiquitous T-shirts.  Surprisingly, this year the tiny Belen (Bethlehem) winery has a booth, with excellent wine for the tasting.  We bought some in January, and again yesterday.  There are also very good restaurants and bars for cocktails and beer.  \\n\\nThrough the middle of this marketplace runs a dirt road, heading toward the impressive, mountainous coastline and the famous blowhole.  The blowhole only spouts water when the tide is in, and the height of the spout varies with ocean conditions. Today, we were told by fellow tour passengers that it was spouting about 60 feet, and got people wet.  There is also a small museum at the blowhole site, and usually people in Aztec or Indian costume and musicians playing.  \\n\\nthe tour gives you about 90 minutes to shop, and asks you to meet back at the bus at the end of that time.  The parking lot has a good bathroom (price 50 cents) and a little taco stand that serves really excellent fish tacos and quesadillas with handmade tortillas for a dollar or two, depending what you order.  \\n\\nThe tour today cost $15, less the $3 we paid for the shuttle ride, and was well worth it. We acquired a lovely piece of stained glass, and some wine, and were very happy with the day.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "202542946": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "tourist trap but worth it", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "views of the beautiful surroundings are completely blocked off by all of the booths on both sides of the trail, so you don\\'t even know you are in a gorgeous peninsula surrounded by water and fascinating vistas", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "202477833": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Must See!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We took a group tour to La Bufadora that left near the little village area near the cruise ships. I recommend that if you are there on a cruise, do not book the tour through the cruise line (Carnival), they overcharge and try to scare you out of booking with the other tour companies just so they can get your money. Trust me, it\\'s a better value to book with a non-cruise sponsored tour company and you\\'ll save a ton of money. Even in the event that their shuttle breaks down, they do have other vans to send so you won\\'t be stranded and miss your cruise. They are all very aware that most people have a cruise to get back to and they are kept on schedule.\\n\\nLa Bufadora itself was surprisingly a bit of a drive from the port, but it lets you see a lot of the city on the way. You will be approached by a lot of street vendors once you get off the shuttle and just remember the magic words &quot;No gracias!&quot; if you want them to leave you alone. Most of the nick-nacks they are selling aren\\'t really as authentic as you might think anyway and it\\'s all overpriced because they expect people to haggle with them to get them to a more normal price. I don\\'t care what they say, I don\\'t trust any of the silver to be real. Don\\'t bother buying the knock-off handbags either, you can get the real thing for the same price as their knock-offs if you visit your nearest outlet mall.\\n\\nIt was really awesome to see such a natural wonder that is La Bufadora. The whole view looking out to the water is very picturesque like a post card and I am glad we chose this excursion over the others.\\n\\nOnce you\\'re done checking out La Bufadora, then go walk around the shops, bargain with the vendors and get yourself some lunch.

She did a good job of telling us which vendors to buy from. The bus driver passed a vehicle on a winding road where you could not see around the bend and to the right was a 300 foot drop off.

You have heard about the La Bufadora.  Historically, everyone goes there once for themselves then again with kids.  Its neat, it wet, and its interesting.  My understanding is that there are only a few in the world.\\n\\nYou will go either on a tour bus, cab, local bus or rental car.  Tour Bus or Cab will be expensive, maybe $ 50 - $ 100 US Dollars.  If you speak a little spanish and have the time, you can take the local busses to it for a few dollars. (dont do this if you are on a cruise). You can rent a car for the day in Ensenada for $ US 70 at Hotel Corona by the beach and cruise line.  Then drive 3-4 people there and have enough time to do other things as well.  Best and lowest cost option for the tourist (rent a car).  To rent you will need DL and Credit card. There are lots of signs and it easy, worst case follow a bus.\\n\\nNow when you get there, you need to park.  If you came on a bus, thats easy, if not, keep driving until you go UNDER the main entrance.  Ignore the folks trying to get you to park, just park inside the area for around $ 2.00 (same as outside). If you took a cab, ask him to wait, and dont pay until you return to Ensenada.\\n\\nIf you like you can rent a boat ride or ki-yack in the ocean down the hill for around $ 15.  But that\\'s not why you are here.  You will now walk the vendor path from the entrance to the La Bufadora, which means everyone is going try and get your money.  Its the worst part, but sometimes in it there are some gems.  You will need to negotiate, and dont be afraid to walk away.  Best to pick a side and walk as you see fit.  I suggest the Churros and the Pineapple drink as snacks then find a $ 4 hat or t-shirt.  I would not suggest eating here (more on that later).\\n\\nYou will get to the blowhole, you will get wet, you will take some great pictures, maybe even listen to some music and buy some local art.  All in about 20 min after you exit the vendor path to the blowhole.  Now, you are hot and wet, and maybe a little hungry.  Don\\'t go to the \\'restaurants\\' , walk back down the vendor path quickly (other side) and look to the left up the hill just before the exit, maybe near where the bus parked. Look for the fish taco stand (they sell lots of diff tacos).  Buy here. Seriously, its the best and while the lines can be long - its the best food.  It will not make you sick. (or should not).  This is where the locals eat, while you will pay gringo/tourist prices, its still cheap and very good.  So grab some tacos (beef/fish/shrimp) and a pepsi and enjoy your time.\\n\\nNow that you are done, if you drove, you can drive back - choosing to stop at the variety of stands for some oil, tamales, or other nick nacks. Fruit stands are good as well.  There are a lot of treasures on the way back, and if you went early enough, you can go visit a winery or two.  Just look at the map you got when you rented the car..you did rent a car..otherwise you are on a bus or taxi going back to Ensenada (or another touristy schick). On the way back, look for the riding horses, the \\'zebra horse\\', the art galleries, the bakery, and several other things you can do on the way back.\\n\\nOh final thoughts, if you can choose when to go and you are not on a cruise, dont go on Wed or Saturday, or wait on those days until after 3:30pm.

Before leaving Ensenada proper, we stopped at what is now the Ensenada Cultural Center. Originally, it had been a speakeasy/gambling hall for various VIPs back in the day. Now, it\\'s mostly used as a rental hall for weddings and parties. Interesting history and lovely grounds. At the end, we were served our choice of a margarita or draft beer in tiny plastic cups. I had the margarita and the only cue that what I drank WAS a margarita was the salt clinging to the top rim. It was more like margarita flavored water.  \\n\\nThen, on to La Bufadora, our tour guide, Irma, was friendly and personable. Though, she did struggle at times with her English and it was clear that she had given this tour hundreds of times due to the rehearsed nature of some of her jokes. The bus was comfortable and relatively clean, but nothing to write home about. \\n\\nWe drove through Ensenada, and what became evident to me was that Ensenada needs to be more aggressive when cleaning up its graffiti. Graffiti is everywhere and so is trash. Of course, off in the distance hills beautiful homes and mansions can be seen. We drove through farms, etc, and about the last 15 minutes of the drive through hills was lovely when the coastline could be seen. \\n\\nWe pull up to a dusty &quot;parking lot&quot; and exited the bus to see La Bufadora. However, to get there, one must walk through about a quarter of a mile of very aggressive vendors selling, what mostly likely is, cheap goods imported from China. Knock-off designer bags, glass-beaded and silver jewelry (sold all over the Ensenada), NFL (!) ponchos, medication (Viagra was loudly touted), ceramic Mario Bros, and other typical junk peddled to tourists. I get that the people are mostly poor and trying to eek out a meager living, but the carnie behavior was off-putting. \\n\\nFinally, having survived the mercado, we climb the steps to see La Bufadora; which looks like a large crevice or crack in which water enters. Thing is, to experience spout of water, there has to be a large amount of water rushing into the crevice. This doesn\\'t happen if the tide is low, which it was when we went and this was very much down-played by our tour guide. So, we stood looking for about 15 minutes hoping and praying we were going to be the &quot;natural phenomenon&quot; of La Bufadora. Nothing. \\n\\nHowever, right before we left, there was a little rush of ocean, and we got a little taste of what must be really amazing on a rough, or stormy day. It was quick and fleeting, and then back to faint deep whistles emanating from the crack.  We decided to head back and braced ourselves for the onslaught of people wishing to part us from our money. \\nI may have been interested had they any merchandise worth purchasing, but it was difficult to differentiate one seller\\'s stall from another. We did decide to stop at a stand and get a margarita. It wasn\\'t horrible, but it wasn\\'t good either. \\n\\nBack on the bus, most of us expressed our disappointment at a non-spouting La Bufadora. Irma just shrugged and told us as a &quot;natural phenomenon&quot; they didn\\'t have control of such things. I was thinking that perhaps she could have better prepared us or at least informed us of how the tide impacts the height of the water spout. \\n\\nSo, if you are planning on visiting La Bufadora, MAKE SURE the tide is high, otherwise, the trip just isn\\'t worth it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "118541900": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Fun and Worth the Drive from Ensenada", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150770-d153903-Reviews-La_Bufadora-Ensenada_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The area where you actually see the spray (and get wet) was lots of fun and very refreshing on a hot day.

Once outside the building there are shuttles which makes you think that downtown is sooooo far away so you pay the $2 per person for this shuttle. The shuttle drives you to the right a  bit and then goes to the left towards downtown. You find out later they made it seem like a long ride to make it worth your money. While driving you the long way, they try to sell  you this tour to La Bufadora for $15 a person. We were a group of 12 so we paid for 12 and got 2 free. So on the shuttle they tell  you a bunch of lies like you can get a mexican blanket for $4 but in downtown it\\'s more. It\\'s not possible, I tried about 15 shops and I got a small one for $10. \\nThe bus ride is about 40  minnutes in a hot shuttle. they have ac which doesn\\'t work and even the driver has his window open so once we opened the windows it felt better. They have this stop to the corona factory but it\\'s really to a convience store in front of the corona factory. But you can buy coronoas $1 per bottle or $2 for 40oz. to drink on the shuttle. Pretty basic tour. Once you get to La Bufadora the guide shows you some shops he says we should &quot;trust&quot; but they are the ones that ripped us off the most. Went to the Blowhole and out our guide disappeared. That day the Blowhole was unimpressive as it was a beautiful day so it just looked like waves splashing on rocks. All our pics never show the Blowhole you see in pics, so it looked like we were just takuing pics with rocks. So we went to look for the free magaritas, which were small and ended up watered down. Weren\\'t sure there was any alcohol in it. But we didn\\'t buy anything, used the clean bathrooms and left. So if you go, pee here!!! everywhere else you have to pay 50 cents. We spent the rest of the time walkign around and not really buying anything as it was not cheaper like the tourguide said. \\nWe wanted to go to the beach after and the guide and driver dropped our group off at the beach. We tipped them $10. but it wasn\\'t asked for. At the beach we had a great time, with locals. and then it was the long walk back which our guide said 15 minutes fast walking and 30 slow. it took us over an hour. and we found out how close downtown was to the ship. \\nSo we ran out of time and didn\\'t get to see downtown but others that didn\\'t opt for this tour enjoyed downtown. They said the shuttle wanted $1 a person to take you back and it wasn\\'t worth it because it was so close.

Its over an hours drive by bus to get there though. Its not a real scenic drive until about the last 10 mins. At this point you will drive through winding hills with views of the ocean. If your prone to motion sickness this may start to take its toll on you but luckily it doesnt last to long. Once you park you have to walk down this street filled with vendor shops....and the employees here are salesman!!! You feel like a guppy in a shark down! Everyone has their eye on you and will try to get you into their shop. If your not interested in shopping just walk down the middle of the road and dont make eye contact with these vendors...as rude as you may think it is, ignore them! If you make any eye contact or verbal chat they will keep pestering you until you go in their shop. It takes about 10 mins to walk from the parking lot down to where the blow hole is. Once there you will see water spray up from out of a rock crevice and up into the air. Its pretty neat for a first timer. I have been there 3 times now (just because there isnt much else to do in Ensenada I think). It is kind of a fun place, the major down side is the long drive to get there and back.

We got on a bus outside the cruise terminal to take us to downtown (about 2 miles). The tour guide told us that they also operate a tour to La Bufadora Blowhole and that it was $15 each rather than the $29.95 that Carnival charges. We would ride the small bus to the site, see the blowhole and have 2 hours total as there was also an open air market. We chose this option and what a good deal! She was a great tour guide as she filled us in on local facts and suggested that we shop after seeing the blowhole as it takes time to see all the merchants. She counted to ensure that all of us had returned and one couple was left behind by another tour bus so they rode with us. Now, my only complaint is that they give each person a free margarita at the local restaurant (which was clean, etc) so we took advantage but later that night my husband began having stomach cramps and have the next day I had the same symtpoms. I made a joke that it must have been the ice for the drinks but I think I may have been right. None of the other passengers had the drink so they were smarter than me.

(Tickets for turor were $15.00pp after $5 discount coupon u get from the tuor bus co. we paid $3.pp to get to the place where u purchachse your tickets and catch a different tour bus for the Blow Hole Tour) Realized later we could of walked over to the booth to purchase the tour tickets but dont know if u can get the discount coupon so all in all we still saved a little.  Our tour guide who\\'s Name was Alex aka &quot;Cookie Monster&quot; (ask hinm Y) was great very informative about what to do and no to do.  Stopped on the way to L a Bufadora for a free bathroom break and drinks and snacks at the Corona Brewery. Alex walked us through the flea market again pointing out the 2 free bathrooms (free does not always mean clean) and other informative tips (dont accept ANY free tequlia) Alex left us at the blow tour and told us if we needed him before time was up we just had to ask for him by nick name and the vendors did know who we were talking about. The Blow Hole was pretyy but eveytime we tried to take a picture of family in front of the spout it wouldn\\'t get big eneough so we switched picture with 2 of us at a time and what dou you know we got them,  I wasnnt ready for the pushiness of all the vendors and about quarter away through we stopped going into each stop (they all have the same stuff}  went almost to the end where we found a shop with only 2 peoploe woking and we purchased everything we wanted and that was that.  The best part of the whole tour had to be the tour guide Aex he was great so if you go ask for him.  We returned to downtown Ensenada and more shops of the same things but also children on the corner as well (hard to take) we used almost all our cash and the store did not take debit/credit cards  on the cruise they said there is a $27 service fee if u use the atm machine in Ensenada however we were told different form those on land we didn\\'t walk the 3 blocks to the bank figured it meant we spent enough and went back to our ship.  Like I said it was nice for the money but we probably would of chose smething different (off road if the price wasn\\'t so high for a family of four) didn;t think it would b safe to break up and the guys go one way and the girls go another.

My kids have never been to Mexico before and we all enjoyed the ride.

The problem with seeing Bufadora, is that there is a string of open shops before you get there.(About a half mile) You have to watch out for some of these shop owners, they are really aggressive. And don\\'t walk into their shop to just look because they will hound you on the street coming and going. Don\\'t accept the first price they offer you. Some of their merchandise is not geniunely Mexican.\\nThey think that every visitor is a big spender. Be especially cautious if you are a single woman, or get separated from your spouse. \\n\\nThe Bufadora site is a very interesting phenomena. It is amazing how it can spout that much water from that tiny little cove! There is a Native Mexican Man dressed in his original headdress and clothes nearby, he plays his drum and flute.

The cruise offered a 3 hour tour for $21 adult $13 child, but we decided to save money and go with an independent tour company.  When we got off the ship, we took the shuttle to downtown Ensenada ($3 round trip).  My 5 year old daughter was free because she sat on my lap for the short 5 minute ride.  During the shuttle ride, the person will announce to you the tours that they provide, including a tour to La Bufadora.  With a $5 off coupon they give you, we each pay $15 for the tour.  Children 5 and under are free.  When we arrive at the downtown location, we get out and go to the blue window to pay for the tour.  We get on a different shuttle and wait approx. 10 minutes before we leave.  It\\'s approx. a 45 minute ride to La Bufadora.  Our tour guide Ignacio kept us entertained on the shuttle with background information about Ensenada.  When we arrived, Ignacio leads us through to the end of the flea market to view La Bufadora.  Afterwards, we\\'re given a couple of hours to eat and shop.  We had fish tacos and shrimp tacos at Mexico Tacos restaurant.  It was fun to eat above the restaurant overlooking the flea market.  The service was great and they gave you free chips &amp; salsa/guacamole.  Oh, and if you eat at the restaurants, you can use their restrooms for free.  Otherwise, you need to pay 50 cents to use public bathrooms.  We bought a bundle of churros for $2.  Merchants were asking $4 for a coconut, but I finally got one for $2.50.  My daughter got her hair braided for $8.  My daughter bought 22 wooden flutes (souvenirs for her classmates) for $25.  On our way back, we get dropped off in front of Papas &amp; Beer; it\\'s a short walk back to the blue window parking lot where we catch our return ride to the cruise ship.  I also found out that if you are a party of four, you can take a taxi to La Bufadora for $10 each.  I will definitely do that next time.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "La Bufadora", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3e/fa/9f/la-bufadora.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Punta Banda", "addressLocality": "Ensenada", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "6717553": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful Place!
