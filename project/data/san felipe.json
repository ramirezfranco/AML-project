The color of the water in &quot;mar of cortez&quot; is just beautiful.  Granted that is a small town, Good Places are hard to fine but they exist I found one excellent place but a little price $250.00 dlls per night for a 2 bedroom Condo.  However, in February when the Baja race starts the weather starts to get much better and the beaches get crowded.   \\n\\nAgain is a quiet beach town.  The best place to eat will be in the Malecon at Gueros restaurant where you can eat the catch of the day for less than 20 us dlls", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "South Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/1a/e8/2f/pelicans-of-south-beach.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "San Felipe", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "338786984": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Unwind", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150775-d1172989-Reviews-South_Beach-San_Felipe_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/1a/e8/2f/pelicans-of-south-beach.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Went for long walks on the endless beach and into the village.\\nThe shrimp and fish are world class as good as anything you could find anywhere in the world.\\n \\n\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "South Beach", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/1a/e8/2f/pelicans-of-south-beach.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "San Felipe", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "244556431": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Not the &quot;South Beach&quot;", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150775-d1172989-Reviews-South_Beach-San_Felipe_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/1a/e8/2f/pelicans-of-south-beach.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is not the&quot;South Beach&quot;of Miami, Florida, as one (drunk?) poster seems to think!
