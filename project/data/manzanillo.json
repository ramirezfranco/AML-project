From the amazing flower arrangement to the \\u201csurprise\\u201d guitar players playing an Elvis Presley song I had talked to Luis about but then changed my mind. He still had them show up and play for us and said, \\u201cit was his gift to us\\u201d!!!\\nLuis is an amazing man and will ensure your trip and tours are a great time!\\nHe even came on our fishing trip and played guitar and sang for us!\\nBonita has also been such a great help with organizing and correspondence with regards to our tours/excursions. Again, she went above and beyond not only with the tours, but helping us with our vacation in general\\u2026.putting us in touch with people we had met the year before, great places to eat, and information and tips on the area.\\nOther tours we did this year were Colima/Comala, Barra de Navidad, Snorkeling, &amp; deep sea fishing.\\nAgain, I have only great things to say about these also. First of all, no crowded tour buses to be on\\u2026.only Kim and I in a car with a tour guide! This way it is very personal, private, fun, and educational.\\nOur tour guide for all of our tours was Chito! This guy is so nice and so much fun! He really goes out of his way to educate you on Manzanillo/Colima. He also made sure we saw and did everything we wanted/needed on each tour, incuding all the pictures I wanted to take. We ended up becoming good friends with Chito and he even came to our wedding ceremony! Thank You again for the gift Chito!!\\nWe are already planning our Manzanillo trip for 2013 and will definitely be booking more excursions with Luis and Bonita!\\nAlso, we are very much looking forward to seeing Luis and Chito again. We are also hoping to finally meet Bonita as we have not been able to yet!\\nThank You again to the three of you\\u2026.you have made our vacations full of memories we will never forget\\u2026.so much so that hopefully one day we will spend much more time in Manzanillo as you have shown us all the great things it has to offer.\\nSee you next year!!!\\nBook with Lujo and you will not be disappointed!\\n\\nGreg &amp; Kimberley Bates\\nWinnipeg, MB\\nCANADA", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa La Audiencia", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/81/5f/88/manzanillo-bay.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Manzanillo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "125471187": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "NIce small beach area", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150791-d152953-Reviews-Playa_La_Audiencia-Manzanillo_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/81/5f/88/manzanillo-bay.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "It is small but nice, and the Tesoro resort is on it and they are building a new condo building on one end of it.

Like all Mexican beaches it is a public beach even though it is dominated by the gigantic, shadow-casting, all-inclusive Hotel Tesoro and the \\nin-construction 17-storey Palapagos Condos. A small bus, BRISAS LAS HADAS, which passes every 20 minutes at Commercial on Miguel de la Madrid, will take you there for 6 pesos. Get off at the stop just before the Tesoro. The entrance to this still lovely beach is not scenic, and means passing the public &quot;Sanatorios&quot;, then through a beach market, but the swimming , snorkeling and diving at both ends of the beach are very good. Efforts have been made to keep the beach cleaner than it was with less plastic and garden waste from La Punta washing up. The black sand on the left corner is not oil, but just that, black sand. However, the noisy little tour boats were observed through binoculars to be emptying their heads in the bay after a day of accommodating tourists\\' toilet needs. Senor &quot;Floatie&quot; is not pleasant and potentially dangerous to swimmers, so report this to the Manzanillo Tourist Office if you happen to see it, or the Tesoro management.\\nThe roped off left corner of the shore is safe (when not polluted!) for children and weak swimmers.  At both ends of the beach, a beach umbrella, a small table and 4 deckchairs can be rented for the day for 100 pesos. The seafood in the beach cafes on the right of the beach have a good reputation locally and fresh coconut juice and beer  can be purchased.\\nEarly morning is a peaceful and shady time on the beach to ponder the history of the place. In the early 16th century, the location of the beach market was the scene of a Conquistador shipyard, which built Spanish brigantines using the hard wood of the manzanillo tree, and no doubt native people as slave labor.  The two visits of Hernan Cortes are commemorated in a grubby plaque above the public toilets. \\n\\n[--]\\n\\nThe last visit of Cortes was in February 1535, and some 450 years later, Bo Derek in the iconic movie Ten&quot; ran down la Playa de la Audiencia, with her blonde cornrows swinging, toward the spot where Cortes and Sandoval once stood.\\nIn that Cortes may be guilty of inciting Moctezuma\\'s Revenge, Bo Derek\\'s athletic  beauty could be the reason so many female tourists imitate the eponymous hairstyle by having &quot;trencitas&quot; woven into hair that often, unfortunately, does not crown such lithe and gorgeous bodies.\\nIf you walk up the hill on Calle Riscos to Las Hadas you will see why the beach scenes of &quot;Ten&quot; were filmed on Audiencia rather than on the meager Las Hadas beach.\\nSunsets (approximately 6:30 pm) seen from the Calle Riscos or on Audiencia are spectacular.

However, during the Christmas season, perhaps they try to take advantage of tourists, as we neglected to ask this time (our mistake) and we were charged 180 pesos.  Felt ripped off considering we had 4 adults and 2 kids, and spent a fair amount of money.  We went again to a different place the following week, and asked first, and eventually the guy didn\\'t charge us for the use of table and umbrellas, which was smart, as we spent about $100 Cdn dollars, and there was no one else there the whole time, so he would have lost out.  I know this is common as it is typical for Mexican families to bring their coolers with food and drink and spend time, so I can see why they\\'d charge for use of facilities, but not for paying customers.

BEWARE - airport miles from town and only taxis are available to travel from there which codsts a fortune. The trip back is more reasonable as you can negociate with local taxis.

This was our second trip. We find this town to be super chill. Very safe and clean. My main purpose was to catch up with some fishing. My captain and now friend is Hernan Ramos.  He speaks excellent English and really knows his stuff when it comes to fishing out of Barra. I take my specialist gear for fly fishing, light spinning and surf casting. He has the equipment for trolling and is good quality. Hernan works really hard at not only getting you on the fish but also working with you so you achieve your plans and goals. Last week I spent 4 days in the boat and 1 surf and river fishing with him. I caught my first marlin and also landed several Dorado on fly. Light tackle jacks on the last day. I really recommend Hernan. He can be found among all the boats plying for business at the south end of town. Just ask for him. The guys (other fishermen)are really good and they can contact him if he\\u2019s out Fishing. You can call him of course direct  +52 1 315 108 4441. If he is out Fishing there is no reception so just keep trying! He will leave dock at around 7am and be back 3-4pm. If you go just remember to tip him well!

Mid 80\\'s everyday, sunny every day, slightly overcast one day (needed that). \\n\\nThe town of Barra, charming and easy to explore on foot. Nearby town of Melaque a 15 minute bus ride away or a long walk on the beach. NOTE: local buses are bumpy, suspension is not a thing here. La Manzanilla 40 min by bus to see crocodiles, do a beach day, eat at a beach front seafood restaurant. Cuastecomete, a handicap accessible beach village accessible by taxi 100 peso\\'s. Totally worth the visit if you like to swim and snorkel. Some seaside eateries, but not as many as La Manzanilla. Manzanillo is a big port city and worth a visit especially if you need supplies. We didn\\'t go there but if we return we probably would take a trip in and check it out. \\n\\nA week is the perfect amount of time to spend here. Foodwise, compared to other Mexican tourist locations, in our opinion Barra is less expensive, and more interesting. We did not do all inclusive and really enjoyed trying all the restaurants everywhere as well as the street food (oil drum chicken, oh my how delish). \\n\\nThe people here are very genuine. Obviously, how people treat you is often reflective of how you treat them. This region appears to be poorer than other areas we\\'ve been to perhaps due to the devastation of the last hurricane from which the tourism has yet to recover fully.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Barra Navidad", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/81/5f/85/barra-navidad.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Manzanillo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "48987", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "467099553": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Good food, calm beach", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150791-d524128-Reviews-Barra_Navidad-Manzanillo_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/81/5f/85/barra-navidad.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "If you go on a weekend (or specially on a holiday) expect service to be quite slow, the calm surroundings make it a great scenario for a place to enjoy your meal and the company.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Barra Navidad", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/81/5f/85/barra-navidad.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Manzanillo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "48987", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "466389740": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Awesome view of the ocean", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150791-d524128-Reviews-Barra_Navidad-Manzanillo_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/81/5f/85/barra-navidad.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "it\\'s almost unreal , but ... it\\'s there - come an see it yourself - will be back this april 2017 for more !!

Off we went to Barra de Navidad where we took a ride in a small boat across the water for lunch.  We toured around the water and saw the yachts and then stopped in at the Grand Hotel. It is a very classy place!  Back in the town of Barra we had time to shop and wander around.  Our tour guide was Daniel of Danitours ~ he drove us to his hometown and we went and saw his brother\\'s place and even saw and waved to Daniel\\'s Dad!  During the 8 hour tour, Daniel would stop when ever we asked for us to take pictures. On the way back to Manzanillo, we stopped at Miramar Beach to the outdoor markets. Here you can buy the original &quot;Mexican&quot; blankets, Vanilla, clothes, etc.  We recommend the Barra de Navidad tour to anyone who wants to experience a great day!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Barra Navidad", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/81/5f/85/barra-navidad.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Manzanillo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "48987", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "344843315": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nice town and beaches ", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150791-d524128-Reviews-Barra_Navidad-Manzanillo_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/81/5f/85/barra-navidad.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I loved the town.

Then take the water taxi to Barra and Colimilla.  The restaurants are very inexpensive and the food is really amazing.  Perfect long weekend for couples.  Breathtaking views.  This place is just lovely to lounge or take long walks around the island.

It is not so much a place to go for the beach.  Other than the lagoon, the surf is large.  Good for surfers!  It is more a place to poke around and but local handicrafts.  Little gifts to take home.  Although it feels, at first, to be a bit of a tourist trap, if you dig a little deeper it is a funky little community.  Quite a big expat population, so the finery that comes with expats, like great croissants can be found if you look.  Our guest usually enjoy taking the pongas, small boats, to either the Grand Bay or one of the many seafood places on isla de navidad.  Food is reasonable.  If you do your homework and are interested in nature, there are boats that take you deep into the lagoon where you can see lots of birds and even scary wildlife.  Bring your binoculars.

It\\'s changing, more tourists, more long-term gringos making homes in upscale houses and no more cobblestone streets and knowing most everyone.  Still it\\'s a good place to be.  You can walk everywhere you need to go, there is a good choice of resturants from basic to fine dining and there is some nightlife.  Piper\\'s bar generally has some pretty good live music.  The beach is good with enough surf to attract surfers at one end.  The nice part is the beach has vendors but not tons of them so you can have some quiet time.  Find Freddy wherever he is bartending these days for the best mango margaritas!  He was last spotted at the Alhondra Hotel.  Many places offer wireless connection these days so you can keep in touch with your friends.  I never make a reservation, seems an abundance of good places to stay from the very affordable ($25 night) to the Grand Bay (last time I was there Dennis Washington had lent his yacht to the president of France and his wife) which is top-end.  I see lots of families with babies these days in Barra but it lacks lots of things for the younger set to do. There is no banana boating, no para-sailing, no scooter rental...its laid back.  If you want more excitement do us a favor and go somewhere else and leave Barra lazy.  If you like fishing you can find some good captains to take you out as well.  Barra isn\\'t for everyone but it is for those who want to lay peacefully, enjoying a good book and having a nice meal.......it\\'s for lover\\'s of Barra!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Barra Navidad", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/81/5f/85/barra-navidad.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Manzanillo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "48987", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Manzanillo_Bay-Manzanillo_Pacific_Coast": {"665777242": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nicer than I expected", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150791-d152391-Reviews-Manzanillo_Bay-Manzanillo_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/76/cc/45/view-from-top-of-the.jpg", "datePublished": "April 12, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Came into the bay by sea and it was much nicer than I expected.

When we had questions, we were always able to get answers right away. We stayed in a beach front bungalow (which do not have A/C, but we did not want it) and we really enjoyed it. There are rooms with A/C though. The food at the hotel was great and the hotel facilities are very well-maintained. One thing worth noting is that wi-fi is still limited (only available in the restaurant/bar area) but many places down there do not even have wi-fi at all. Another note is that the surfing at this particular spot is more advanced than Sayulita (it is a left break off the point, and there are rocks) just as an FYI but I would recommend this resort to anyone going down to this area as Sayulita is only a 25-30 minute drive away.

He mentioned usually people from cruise ships want to run a quick errand and head back to the ships, which we thought was kind of sad. He didn\\'t seem to think that cruise ship days were a boon for the economy, really. Which on one hand is a shame, because the other parts of Manzanillo were really pretty. On the other hand, this keeps the real Manzanillo a secret and keeps the large tourist crowds out of these areas.\\nWe really only drove around for 10 minutes or so to get a feel, stopping outside the main church and going by the iguana park as well. And back we went to the main boulevard.\\nSo I\\'d guess I\\'d say to visitors coming in by cruise ship: if you want a more resort, beachy experience, look for restaurants on the boulevard and enjoy the drive and the food once there.

Tourists from the hotel area can take a 6-peso bus ride on an El Centro-marked  bus from the &quot;Commercial&quot; big box neighbourhood (Walmart, Home Depot and the supers)  and get off at the last stop, a short distance from the enormous sailfish sculpture on the seafront.\\n\\n. A walk along the esplanade (Malecon de Cabotaje) affords views of naval ships, fishing boats and small yachts. Bronze statues of sailors are moving testaments to the &quot;men who go down to the sea in ships.&quot;  Across from the seaside park is Juarez Avenue running parallel to the sea.  On the corner of Juarez and Madera you should be able to obtain a clear city map , and upstairs in the City Hall (Presidencia Municipal) there are free, clean toilets ( Bring your own toilet paper and hand sanitizer!)  Further along on Juarez is a small city museum.  However, with pesos burning holes in your pocket, the shopping opportunities on Juarez might draw you west again.  It is advisable to window shop and get an idea of what is available and of prices before you turn left on to Avenida Mexico, the main drag, also with very tempting stores and inexpensive internet offices, and head toward the central market ( El mercado central) down Calle Cuauhtemoc from Avenida Mexico.\\n\\nThis recently built market sells everything from fresh seafood to mysterious herbs to plastic toys and clothes for the most modest budget.  The market has two levels and upstairs are small cafes with real Mexican food at real Mexican, not tourist, prices.  The toilets ( sanitorios) are on the main floor and cost 3 pesos---including toilet paper.\\n\\nBy now you may be feeling like having a beer or a meal in a quieter place than the market, so retrace your steps along Avenida Mexico toward the port and on your left you will see the 1940\\'s Hotel Colonial, which is well worth a visit for its traditional architecture alone. You might be able to find there a 3-course meal ( menu del dia) a bargain at 75 pesos.  The hotel\\'s  Los Candiles restaurant, with its cool courtyard and view of the goings on in the main street is popular with local Mexican businessmen and families. The restaurant\\'s  restrooms are a clean place to freshen up before continuing with your day in town.\\n\\nThe downtown souvenir stores and boutiques do not close at midday, so you can do some leisurely shopping or more exploring in the interesting hillside stairs of the sidestreets of the port.\\n\\nIf you work up a thirst, the vintage 1940\\'s Bar Social near the corner of Juarez and Marzo is the Manzanillo watering hole you should visit.

I probably could have gone on my own as I was living a couple of hours away at the time but I wasn\\'t that sure that the brakes on my then 15 year-old Jeep Sahara would suffice for the return trip. We spent the night in Comala to get an early start and drove out to the Nevado de Colima National Park early in the morning. Once off of the highway we immediately began to climb and the drive up through the forest of pine and robles was beautiful. Here and there as we climbed the forest opened up to great vistas. Something I found very interesting on the trip up were the different layers of soil visible in the banks along the road. We could actually see by the different colours and textures of the layers how they had been laid, one on top of another, when the mountain was formed. \\n\\nArriving at the parking lot at the top of the road that is accessible to the public we noted that it was starting to cloud over. No matter, we were the only people there which was nice and we set off for the observation centre and then the summit of the Nevado on foot. As we walked up the dirt road through the pine forest I could feel the lack of oxygen in my lungs - we were at almost 4000 meters at that point and reached 4000 meters at the observation centre. Jupiter had us all take it easy though and we all made it to the top in good form, no problems with exhaustion or sickness due to the altitude. \\n\\nUnfortunately when we reached the observation point where the University of Colima have their station to monitor the Volc\\u00e1n de Fuego - the active volcano - the cloud and mist had us completely socked in and we couldn\\'t see much more than about 10 feet in front of us. It was chilly up there, and rather eerie, with a fairly strong breeze blowing the cloud and mist around so things kept appearing and then disappearing. So with no view of the  Volc\\u00e1n de Fuego we made our way back down through the swirling mist and cloud to the vehicle in the parking lot. Even though we didn\\'t get to see the Volc\\u00e1n de Fuego the trip was well worth it for me.

Once at the top the view was spectacular &amp; the zipline was the best we have ever been on &amp; we have been on quite a few. All of us, right down to the 8 year old had a wonderful time.  Wally &amp; the gentlemen who helped were very nice &amp; made sure we were well taken care of.  On our way back to the hotel, we stopped at an open pit for local pizza which was very good.

Booked the zip line excursion with Natura Camp through our resort and could not have been more pleased! They picked us up at our hotel in the most amusing van (no walls..just metal bars with seats bolted on them) and it was so FUN! The ride through the city to pick up the other guests was a great adventure alone!! My son obviously loved it too :) we drove through a little town and up a mountain to a neat little area, which also had deer we could pet! We met the most friendliest staff and once we geared up, we started our hike/climb to the zip lines. The hike was quite nice because we rested half way at an area that overlooked the jungle. Great photo op ;) once we reached the top, highest line, we had a quick lesson on how to go down the line and off we went. Now let me JUST TELL YOU THIS I AM TERRIFIED of heights! :S so decided to get on the line second before I lost my nerve. A quick reminder on how to pose and I was off(legs shaking..lungs expanding) but once off the platform and in the open air the experience/view is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! I fell in lust with the thrill! They gave my son the option to do this 1st line attached to my husband. They both loved it! After that my son was 1st in line and doing the remaining 4 lines like a little pro :D! \\nAfter the fun, we sat down to pizza and soda from a local pizza shop. We unfortunately could not eat the pizza due to our allergies to pork but the group all had big satisfied grins so I\\'m assuming it was delicious! \\nThe team were great and encouraging. They let us look around the land and take pictures of the landscape. \\n\\nI would recommend them to anyone looking for a good time in the Manzanillo area.

The site is very interesting because it is huge - and they have only uncovered a small portion of it - and because it is constructed of smaller sized rocks cemented together, not giant blocks of stone as are many of the prehispanic ruins in Mexico. It surprised me that they had some sort of cement way back then that not only held the rocks together but also lasted this long - some of the structures are quite high and quite large - and I was also surprised by the fact that, visible on many of the structures, is a built in drainage system. It is fun to wander through the pathways and climb the structures (staying on the stairs and pathways please) and enjoy the different views, the volcanoes are quite visible in the background  on clear days. La Campana is located very close to shopping centres and other businesses and accessible from a main traffic route so it is quite \\'urban\\' in setting. For this reason I prefer the slightly more remote and very similar El Chanal ruin that is a few kilometers away and currently in a more rural setting, though the city of Colima is encroaching.

There are no time share salespeople in Manzanillo and it is not anywhere as touristy as PV or Cancun.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Santiago Peninsula", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/50/25/71/manzanillo-colima.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Manzanillo", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "287387152": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A MISH MOSH OF MAGIC", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150791-d152954-Reviews-Santiago_Peninsula-Manzanillo_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/50/25/71/manzanillo-colima.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "As you turn into the road that circles the Santiago Peninsula you will find middle class condominium projects, hotels of all stars. a beach.

FREE!!, outside of an &quot; absolute non-pressured&quot; donation.
