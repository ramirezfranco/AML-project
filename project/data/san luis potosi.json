A few kilometers from the town you can find the surrealist garden created by Edward James, a wonderful place created by the wild imagination of this artist. However, as beautiful as the town and the surroundings are, if you are driving, be careful not to park in the main square, the municipal government is full of crooks whose purpose is not that you enjoy your stay, but to extract money from you by means of issuing a ticket to you for parking in places that only them know it is prohibited: nowhere in the square there is a single indication of that. Also, if you drive to the surrealist garden, you will have to parallel park in the road and the same government \\u201cassigned\\u201d some guys to \\u201cguard\\u201d the cars and they are very pushy and aggressive collecting parking fees. If you do not \\u201ccooperate\\u201d, your car may suffer some \\u201cincidental\\u201d damages. The town\\u2019s people are great, we had the assistance of a couple of locals so kind that they guided us closely when trying to pay the fine and get out of the town on our way to Ciudad Valles. They sweetened a bit the bitter taste of the extortion we suffered in the two places I mentioned above. If you pay attention to that, you will enjoy your visit to the town.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Xilitla", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/11/32/24/33/xilitla.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "San Luis Potosi", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "79050", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "664310989": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "surrealism lives in the cloud forest", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153477-d12996179-Reviews-Xilitla-San_Luis_Potosi_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/11/32/24/33/xilitla.jpg", "datePublished": "April 6, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "a once in a lifetime experience, though i would surely return if possible.  any art lover would be blown away by this experience.  wear comfortable shoes, lightweight clothing with a bathing suit underneath.  the restaurant inside of las pozas is excellent as well.  recommended for those in good shape and able to climb steep hills.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Xilitla", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/11/32/24/33/xilitla.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "San Luis Potosi", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "79050", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "617117273": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Xilitla: a beautiful ride by bus through the gorgeous Serra Gorda to hot and humid Xilitla.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153477-d12996179-Reviews-Xilitla-San_Luis_Potosi_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/11/32/24/33/xilitla.jpg", "datePublished": "September 16, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Xilitla is a hot and humid small pueblo magic up in the Sierra Gorda.

Due to the lack of water in the area, the town developed in San Luis Potos\\u00ed, about 45 minutes away. \\n\\nThe San Pedro Mine is once again active, yielding gold, silver, limestone, zinc, lead sulphide, and other minerals. It contains a reserve of over 71 million tons of minerals, over 50 million ounces of which are believed to be gold and silver. \\n\\nThe town itself is extremely small,  containing a few buildings, a small plaza, and a temple, which was not open. A two room museum provides history of the mine and a guided tour to an overlook of the restricted mining area. Only from here could we see the mining layers of the pit that dynamite has chipped away, and the trucks leaving the site, laden with stone.  Unfortunately, visitors are not allowed to take pictures inside this restricted area. \\n\\nExplosion times are advertised and we were lucky enough to visit on one of these days. We waited in town for the 3:00 detonation. We then heard and felt the rumble of the explosion - very similar an earthquake, but the sensation was more surreal.  \\n\\nIf you\\'re going to go out of your way to visit here,  know that it is very small and unremarkable to look at. The value is in its history and being treated to a dynamite detonation nearby. Don\\'t pass up the homemade gorditas made by a woman and her family in the little plaza by the church.

If you\\'re looking to spend an afternoon relaxing at the park, this is the ideal place to go.\\n      Features:\\n1. This is the 2nd largest urban park in Mexico (The 1st being Chapultepec in Mexico City) with 411 hectares of green trees, man-made lakes, and grassy areas\\n2. There\\'s an aquatic park inside with an indoor pool, shallow outdoor pool, outdoor wave pool, 4 waterslides, and a kiddie pool with play structure. There are a few snack and drink stands, many tables with shade structures, some bbq pits, basketball and volleyball courts on concrete, and an indoor weight room. \\n- It\\'s 60 pesos adult entry for the day ($4), which is a good deal when everything is running. I looked around inside on Aug 1st and the pools were half-filled and the waterslides weren\\'t running. They told me they were having problems with the water that day. Idk if that\\'s the case, but I advise you to do what I did and sweet-talk security into letting you look around a bit first. \\n3. An observatory (planetarium).  I think once a month (last Thursday..?) it\\'s free. \\n4. An interactive science museum (Laberinto) that is supposed to be very good. \\n5. A regional museum\\n6. A gym with a wall of windows facing the lake\\n7. A natural-ish pond with ducks and a larger, man-made lake for canoeing, fishing\\n8. An outdoor theater\\n9. Fountains (that sometimes run. There doesn\\'t seem to be a scheduled time/day) and many bronze statues of people who were influential in developing the culture and city of San Luis.\\n10. Soccer fields, walking/jogging paths\\n11. Picnic tables and some bbq pits\\n12. Playgrounds\\n\\nCity buses (yellow) can be caught in downtown San Luis by the Centro or Caja de Agua and will stop here. It\\'s about a 10-12 min drive by car from the Caja de Agua/San Miguelito area downtown. \\n\\nIn sum, if you\\'re looking for city history, monuments, culture, and photo ops, there are many other sites in town that are more ideal.  However, if you\\'re looking for some low-key family activities, or a relaxing day in a tranquil atmosphere, this is the place. \\n\\nHope that helps!

However, plan wisely Although approximately 25 km east of Rio Verde, only a small portion of that is driving on a smooth paved road. About 80% of the drive will be on very curvy and narrow dirt road with spectaular views straight out of a National Geographic special! You will pass through tiny little pueblos dotted with big, happy cows that are far more interested in the lush vegetation than looking out for oncoming vehicles. But a gentle honk seems to do the trick. \\nYou will eventually arrive at a large gate next to a large sign informing individuals that you are arrived a state park. Go inside and pay a minimal entrance fee, and away you go. From that point the road becomes even bumpier due to runoff from previous rains but the natural beauty of this enchanted area makes for a fun adventure! Your car will have to cross a few streams before arriving at an obvious information center with a large parking field right in front of it (to the right). Therefore, drive a vehicle that can handle this kind of terrain. From the parking lot area, you will hike 2 more km until you reach the gruta entrance located left of the suspended bridge that connects visitors to eco-friendly restrooms (bring toilet paper and hand sanitizer).\\nThe hike itself is pretty easy but not flat. You will have to cross 3 streams with beautifully clear and cold water no higher than mid calve. The road can be a little muddy but you can certainly role up a sturdy baby stroller. It is this part of the adventure where you may encounter many very small but colorful butterflies, grasshoppers and flowers. And yes, more well-feed cows! \\nKeep in mind that you cannot bring strollers into the gruta. It is damp and dark inside, but surprisingly not claustrophobic.
