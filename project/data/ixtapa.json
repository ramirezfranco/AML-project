Beach area is clean and expansive, offering ample space for diverse activities, such as beach sports, sun bathing, running, walking and recreational things-to-do like parasailing. The waves are spectacular though ominous for the causal swimmer. If you pause long enough to examine the waves you can see sting rays skimming the crest and quickly disappearing into the trough. The sun rises are beautiful, and the sun sets are stunning with its kaleidoscope of red and orange colors. It reminds us of the sun sets above Santorini Island in Greece, which are often described as the \\u201cmost romantic sunsets\\u201d in the world. The beach also offers one-hour massages at a fraction of cost of a hotel massage. We were skeptical at first, but as we walked the beach, we met numerous vacationers on their way to get a massage. For some it was a daily ritual. Based on the recommendations, we tried it, and we\\u2019re glad we did. For us, this massage is the best ever for the money, and all the while the only ambient sound heard is the crashing of the waves onto the shore. It left us feeling great and became a daily ritual for us as well. There are two massage locations on the beach. One is on east end of the beach, which we were told cost more, and the other is on the west end, which we used. We thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our time on the beach.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playa el Palmar", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/00/61/7c/photo0jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "658694298": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Palmer Beach", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152761-Reviews-Playa_el_Palmar-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/00/61/7c/photo0jpg.jpg", "datePublished": "March 15, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Love this beach!

There are 2 public access points where anybody can easily walk on a paved driveway right up to the sand and surf.\\n\\nThe first cut-through is right next to the Barcelo resort, near the south end of the beach.  To get to the Barcelo you can take ANY bus that says Ixtapa on the windshield from the central area of Zihuatanejo.  Busses that say Ixtapa or Ixtapa Marina or Ixtapa Playa Linda will ALL go right past the Barcelo resort.  The fare is 12 pesos as of October 2017.\\n\\nAdditionally, there is an Oxxo convenient store across the street from the Barcelo - perfect to pick up some cold beers/drinks/snacks for the beach.  When you do get to the beach next to Barcelo, there are some tables, chairs &amp; umbrellas that can be rented too... but be advised, they are pretty beat up and the beach right there is certainly not the nicest area.  There are also a couple food carts selling tacos &amp; other local favorites at the beach entrance.\\n\\nThe other public cut-through to Playa Palmar is about a mile further to the north - next to the Park Royal hotel tower and the &quot;Dolphinity&quot; exhibit.  Once again, there is a handy Oxxo store directly across the street from the short roadway that goes to the beach.  But to get to this spot by bus you must take the Ixtapa MARINA bus.  The other busses that say Ixtapa do not go as far down this stretch of the coastal/hotel road - toward the Ixtapa Marina.  The fare is still 12 pesos - and you could walk from where the Ixtapa and Playa Linda busses turn off - but it\\'s hot &amp; unnecessary.  Take the Marina bus.\\n\\nLastly, at this more northern entrance to the beach there are 2 restaurants with tables and umbrellas on the beach that do serve food and drink to anybody with cash money.  There are also a few palm trees that might provide some shade.  The rest of this gorgeous beach is all taken up by all-inclusive resorts -- so there is nowhere else the public can purchase food or drink or even sit in chairs or shade.\\n\\nFinally, be warned, the waves and undertow can be dangerous all along Playa Palmar.  There are some lifeguards but most people seem content to go only about waist deep.  The beach itself is probably the nicest stretch of sand in the Ixtapa/Zihuatenejo area; flat, fluffy, golden, clean, no rocks. Really nice!  It goes another half-mile or so further north too, ending at the Marina... then of course, about a mile to the south past the Barcelo resort.  We spent a couple lovely afternoons picnicking in the middle of Palmar - but again, no shade.

Maybe three miles, it\\u2019s a bowl shaped bay of sandy shores from the rocky breakwater at the marina to the rocky cliffs of the seaside hills that dive into the coastline that separates Ixtapa from Zihuatanejo.  The beach is graced by half a dozen or so hotels and several condos that face the blue pacific, and the horizon is endless except a series of rocky dome islands that define the sightline boundaries of the bay.  The surf roars.  Everywhere you look on the beach there\\u2019s a lot going on.  People run the compact sand near the edge of the tides before daybreak, madrugada over the Sierra Madres.  The walkers walk along the ocean\\u2019s edge.  The day begins and life on the beach erupts like spontaneous chemistry.  People play with balls and nets.  Kids play with sand pails.  They roll and tumble in the waves.  Along the sea walls of the hotels and condos the chairs beneath the palapas fill.  From my vantage shaded by a palm thatched palapa at a hotel situated just about center to the bay, there is animated opportunities for people watching as everybody plays at the beach.  Playa Palmar is Ixtapa\\u2019s grand promenade.  The parachutes take off and land with riders pulled airborn ten stories by speedboats that moor just beyond the breakers \\u2013 what a view.  There\\u2019s volleyball, and soccer, people tossing Frisbees, aerobies and american footballs, flying kites and slinging bolos.  And walking, up and down the beach, kicking the walls at each end, observing the activities, the other walkers.  Vendors selling beachwear, eyewear, crafts, jewelry, news mags, mariscos, henna tattoos, excursions and fishing all walk by in the sand, never hassling anybody, being friendly as they pass through, here and there a showing and a sale.  The latest thing are three man bands dressed as cowboys who will sing and play a medley of mexican tunes for an agreed price.  Along this beach you walk an international crossroads.  Everybody wears a suit \\u2013 bathing suits.  It\\u2019s intergenerational.  The sky is blue with dapple clouds \\u2013 wear sunscreen, hats and shades by all means \\u2013 and the ocean breeze caresses you as the sea embraces your ankles and your soles and toes paw the spongy sand.  You can observe the people at the swimming pools and patios of the other condos and hotels.  Public access from the town is viable from several places.  A ceremony takes place releasing baby turtles into the sea.  They\\u2019re setting up for a beachfront wedding.  You see dopplegangers of people you think you know among the crowds.  Somebody\\u2019s speaking quebecois french.  Guys who rent out jet skis name their watercraft Lama and Pirata.  The parachutes advertise ice cream and beer.  The hotel hospitality is the finest on the planet.  People you get to know however briefly are cheerful and simpatico, and conditions can favor making friends.  Please, kids, don\\u2019t throw sand.  You can read beach novels and write in your spiral notebook under the palapa, and just think, contemplating the roaring surf.  There\\u2019s the Girl from Ipanema!  And again.

We went again a few days later and another couple who were also cycling told us they saw a crocodile on the bike path. Yikes!! All we saw on the bike path was a coati (so cute!!). There is also a dirt trail that intersects the paved trail at about the 4km mark. We decided to give that a go and unless you are a experienced mountain cyclist, you will find this to be a very steep hill. We biked up about 10% of the hill then had to walk up. We did not get to the top as we were on a tight time schedule but I\\'m sure there is a fabulous lookout up there. It was hot and dusty and difficult to walk our bike down (again, too steep for me to ride!) Sure was a good workout though!

I was looking forward to some sensational seafood ocean side. Was definitely impressed with the beach. The two restaurantes? Not so much. On the recommendation of the taxi driver I went to La Palapa.  I ordered a Michelada for 50 pesos. Wrong! When my bill came it was 85! The waiter showed me the small print on the menu. With Clamato juice: 85 pesos. Ridiculously expensive for a 25 pesos beer and a splash of Clamato. Okay, onto my entree. Camarones Diablo. That should have redeemed my lunch. But, nooooooo, the dish was served with COLD rice and a very skimpy amount of halved and twisted shrimp ( to take up more space presumably). I immediately summoned the waiter and sent it back. It returned with the rice barely warmed. I ate it but honestly the sauce was disappointing and the lackluster shredded lettuce and one slice of tomato didn\\'t elevate my dining experience ONE iota. Not even half of one iota because when the bill arrived an AUTOMATIC 10% tip/ propina was added even though I was NOT in a large group but only on my own. Just wretched and by far THE worst 235 peso meal I\\'ve had here. The word horrible is an understatement! Okay, so after I left leaving NO tip I did some browsing and bought a brightly coloured beach dress which uplifted my spirits somewhat. Then I thought I\\'d go to the other restaurante to see if perhaps I\\'d just made the wrong choice!  I ordered a 25 pesos beer and observed the food arriving at the other tables. Looked just as bad ( and probably as overpriced!) as the driver recommended place. I was prepared to hang around longer but there were NO reclining lounge chairs on the beach so I headed back to the bus stopping at a shop for a Magnum ice cream bar. Even though it was Sunday the ice cream chest was not properly stocked and there were no Magnums. At the bus stop there was a crocodile viewing area and lo and behold the welcome sight of an OXXO! I gratefully sprinted over to get my Magnum and a cold beverage for the bus ride back to Zihautenejo.  Beach? Tres Estrellas  Restaurantes? O or actually -2 since you need to either bring your own lunch OR stop at OXXO prior to your time on the beach. My parting thought was that there were FAR, FAR too many vendors with virtually the SAME merchandise!  The concept of variety and different offerings seems to be out of the ordinary for some reason. I\\'ve seen this at other mercados. 6 or 8 or even 10 side by side stalls with identical merchandise; unpriced,  of course! Overall, a lower mid level beach experience that could have doubled easily with even ONE decent Restaurante.

Two friends and I road our bicycle on the specially built 10 km bicycle path from Ixtapa to Playa Linda. This was built under the direction of a past Mexican president (four presidents ago I believe) who periodically vacationed in Ixtapa with his family. His daughter was a bicycling enthusiast and so he had this path built through the jungle to Playa Linda. The path is perfectly paved, painted a terracotta red, and about 10 feet wide. Its a great way to get there. There is so much to see. Lots of neat birds. \\n\\nOnce in Playa Linda, it is clear that this is where the surfers hang out. You have broad stretches of beach that are wide open to the Pacific Ocean providing good surf. Another highlight was the crocodiles in the river that flows out to the ocean at the south end of Playa Linda. This is at the end where you take the launch to Ixtapa Island. There is a fence along the side of the river so you can look at the crocks without worrying about your safety.

Our hotel was built into the side of a cliff, so there wasn\\'t a real beach to visit or walk along.  This beach was a pretty long stretch of sand, so it is a nice place to enjoy a stroll.  Other than that, it is a pretty standard beach.  On your way there, stop and check out the crocodile preserve.  I hadn\\'t ever seen a crocodile in its natural habitat, so that was neat (but also smelly).

Today, true artifacts and reproductions of original artifacts are on display in a nicely curated museum. Sadly, the stele stone and many of the most prized artifacts have probably been transported to the archaeological museum in Mexico City for safekeeping, though hopefully not surreptitiously sold to private collectors. The displays and exhibitions in the museum here are however very enlightening, and well presented. As my title suggests, we attended on February 16, which is the annual Fuego Nuevo (New Fire) celebration, and as a result, we were the beneficiaries of a charming young woman named Gema, a university student from Petatlan volunteering as a guide for the festival day!  Our Spanish is serviceable, so we learned so much more information from her about the museum on this visit than we had from just the printed exhibit descriptions before. We greatly enjoyed her interpretation of the ball court facility, and the pyramid. It is a commanding view from the top of the pyramid facility that gives you the sensation of what is to come. Off in the distance, you see a hill, and realize it is not a hill, but in fact another pyramid buried and waiting to be excavated! On this one day of the year, they hold a big celebration in the village field, with food vendors and arts/crafts vendors and indigenous dance performances. I purchased some darling baby booties, some coconut soap, and a fabulous bottle of hibiscus flower infused Mezcal! We purchased some beautiful homegrown tomatoes, star fruit, and an alarmingly hot habanero pepper!  We really enjoyed a glass of fermented pineapple juice, that I would equate to a kombucha type drink. It was wonderful! This is an archaeological zone with ongoing excavation, so new artifact finds and structure reveals are always taking place!  It is worth a visit anytime, but especially on any given February 16!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Xihuacan Museum and Archeological Site", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/94/28/b1/xihuacan-museum-and-archeologi.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "La Chole", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "649754833": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "La Soledad de Maciel and Xihuacan ruinsZihua Eco Tours", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d4049564-Reviews-Xihuacan_Museum_and_Archeological_Site-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/94/28/b1/xihuacan-museum-and-archeologi.jpg", "datePublished": "February 2, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We had an excelent tour with Zihua Eco Tours  owned and operated by Norma Blanco. 52  755 127  0982\\nnblanco16@hotmail.com. \\nNorma was a very friendly and knowledgeable tour guide\\nShe has been a resident of Zhuatenejo area her entire life and has much insight to the surrounding areas, history and knowledge a variety of plants. On this particular tour  our first stop was a tile and brick laying business which came with a hands on lesson in tile making, complete with animal farm. \\n\\nOur next stop was La soledad de Maciel where the MesoAmerican Museum is located with the Xihuacan ruins adjacent. We were given a tour by a native to the \\nArea by the name of Aden Valez Romero. He and his family have personally unearthed many of the artifacts in the museum prior to it being recognized as a ruin. Read the wikipedia article regarding Xihuacan ruins. He was a very impassioned guide and Norma did and excellent job of translating from Spanish to English. \\n\\nWe then visited the ruins beginning with the ball court, one of the largest in the country . The ball court game ended in \\nthe winning team being sacaraficed!  Next we climbed to the only one of three unearthed pyramids. The entire ruins were covered in mud after a tsunami . Its truly one of Mexicos hidden gems because it hasn\\u2019t been turned into a huge tourist zone yet. They have only just begun to excavate the site . The work they\\'ve done to date is pristine. \\n\\nOur final stop on the tour was the village of La Soledad de Maciel. Here Norma took us to her family friends house and  they proceeded to make us coffee , show us how to roll cigars, and feed us a meal of homemade frijoles, tortillas, quesso ,salsa and shredded pork . All the food and tobacca was grown in their town. The Senora cooked everything on a open flame complete with tortilla grill. Completely authentic with an opportunity to make tortillas and then share a meal with this charming family. So welcoming!\\n\\nThe best part of this tour was the personalized service we received from Norma. She went out of her way to show us a good time. I felt completely relaxed and at home with her. She never rushed us through any part of our day. \\nI would like to note that the tour price which , is very resonable for 6 hours does not include tips which are given to the various guides and hosts in the form of buying their handmade whares such as pottery , embroidery and cigars. \\n\\nNorma also offers a variety of other tours including hot springs and turtle releases. She can accomodste 2 to 14 people in a air conditioned car or van.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Xihuacan Museum and Archeological Site", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/94/28/b1/xihuacan-museum-and-archeologi.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "La Chole", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Playa_Coral-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast": {"666466483": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "SUPERB", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d12909708-Reviews-Playa_Coral-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/f1/26/32/plenty-of-shade-to-stay.jpg", "datePublished": "April 14, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "So beautiful, and so much marine life to see.

We felt that it was priced reasonably, and it was a good value for what we paid.  All 4 of us got to spend 20+ minutes in the water with the dolphins, and a very knowledgeable and friendly guide.  He spoke excellent English, so it was easy to ask questions.  He was very accommodating and told us not to worry about time, when one of the dolphins wanted to go and play instead of staying by us.  This was a late Christmas gift for our 7 year old daughter, and she absolutely loved it. Our son is almost 6, and he was a little more timid, but also loved it, and has been talking about it.  We also watched the dolphin show, the day before we did the swim. That was very fun and entertaining as well. It was a nice way to give the kids a preview of the swimming experience, so they weren\\'t scared or surprised as to how it would be.  The only slight downside that I had was dealing with buying the photos.  One of the guys gave me a price, and when I came back with my money to purchase the disc, it seemed as though the people didn\\'t believe that price.  Finally it worked out, but then they wouldn\\'t accept some of the American dollars that I had, due to some writing and/or small tears.  As I didn\\'t want to come back a third time, I wasn\\'t able to get all of the photos, and spent 1/2 the amount that I was going to spend on all the photos, to buy only 6.

The Dolphin would lay on my neck and I felt the same sensation as the EMS, like tiny electrodes pulsating through my neck muscles.It was a very unique experience and relaxing. As far as cost, they do offer discounts at certain times of the year. I would recommend it and if you feel relaxed after a message on the beach (which is a favorite thing tourists love to get done here), then this will blow you away.

This was a reduced price from the $116 he started out with. I paid that and then was told that we had to pay extra to go and watch the children which I did. At this point we were a little ticked that this was not mentioned up front. We then proceed to try and take pictures and were immediately told that was not allowed - again another cash grab! This was a very expensive 45 minute swim and unfortunately we don\\u2019t have pictures as we refused to pay the inflated prices. We are Canadian and by the time we did the US exchange this would have been a $800 to $1000 swim fo 6 children ages 5-11. Crazy! They certainly don\\u2019t make it affordable for families.

The actual experience was fun for my daughters, but I was frustrated that they would not let us take pictures. In Grand Cayman you could take as many photos as you wanted. This did not impact people purchasing the professional photos in my opinion. There is no way anyone could take the same kind of photo from the distance onlookers had. I bought the professional photo from Grand Cayman but was happy to have action shots too, and I have to think very few people would buy many pics at 9.00 per pic. The video of the experience was 88 dollars. Good grief. We bought two photos of each daughter. Then we waited Forever for them to put them on a cd.

The 30 minutes was only advertised on the Expedia website. 20 minutes turned out to be enough though.\\n \\nThey have a list of things that you have to do before you get in the water like make sure you are not wearing sunscreen, take off any rings and jewelry of any kind. We were wearing sunscreen and had wings that could not come off, so we asked them what to do, they said it was fine. A little contradictory but it was ok.\\n\\nThe actual dolphin encounter was amazing. You literally get to pet dolphins touch them all over and interact with them. They are amazing animals and I will never forget this opportunity. We had been to SeaWorld in the past where are you can\\'t get near these things, so this was a real treat to be swimming with dolphins.\\n \\nThe pictures that they sell at the end are not outrageously priced. $8 for each picture it does not matter if they\\'re printed there or if you get them on a CD same price. They offer a HD video for $79.\\n \\n It was fun, you should check it out.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Delfiniti", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/33/11/55/delfiniti.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Boulevard Ixtapa s/n Lote Anexo 6 B, Zona Hotelera", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "40880", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "344457460": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Have my own thoughts but our daughter really  wanted to do this.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d260087-Reviews-Delfiniti-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/33/11/55/delfiniti.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I know there is controversy about dolphins in captivity.

We arrived and waited. When the previous group ran late, the dolphinarium sent additional staff to distract us with a lynx (a medium sized wild cat with tall ears) and colorful parrots.  When the 45 minute event began, we were escorted into the pools where we were introduced to two dolphins. Other dolphins were in the same tank as well as other tanks near bye.  The trainer explained to us how one of the two dolphins was actually born there, so unlike other dolphinariums, these dolphins are not collected in bloody collection processes as shown in some of the horrific documentaries that are quite popular right now. He introduced us to the dolphin\\'s mother and father.  They had the dolphin do tricks and planned interactions with us while we were in the tank.  After the first 25 minutes, we got out of the first pool and climbed into the main show pool where two of the more mature dolphins engaged us in actual stunts.  Both my girlfriend and I had the pleasure of being lifted out of the water as the dolphins pressed their noses simultaneously into the bottoms of our feet and propelled us upward.  We were given the opportunity to hold onto the dolphin\\'s fins and be pulled through the water, and after all of this, we were given a private show while our feet dangled in the water and the trainer took the dolphins through all the regular show stunts that people usually watch only from the stands.  My fianc\\u00e9 and I were able to watch as another family who only got the 25 minute experience interacted with dolphins from the edge of the pool on a platform, and we realized how lucky we were to opt for the longer experience.

Here is your chance to be close to Dolphins and watch how they interact with a crowd of adults and gleeful young\\'uns.  Bring a towel and bathing suit. You will be provided a life jacket, good instructions and a never to forget experience. The staff will take lots of photos of you, your family and everyone else. I cannot say enough good about the event and the trainers as they work with tourists and dolphins. Listen to the trainers and the time with the Dolphins will only whet your appetite for more. I have only one criticism for the attraction. It is a gosh awful pain to figure out where and how to get and pay for pictures of you and your family having the experience. There are display screens flashing photos all over the entry and you have to watch to see which monitor your family shows up on. Then a numbering system for ordering certain pics is needed. When you get all of this down, find a young attendant to fill out the order form.  The photos are very pricey so limit the amount you choose.

Although our children enjoyed this when we went (and why this rated a &quot;poor&quot; and not a &quot;terrible&quot;) we felt very uncomfortable with our decision and certainly would never return.  The space for the dolphins seems very small and I worried about how well the dolphins are looked after.

By going to Definiti we felt we were ensuring that dolphins would continue to be captured from the wild.  The &quot;dolphin encounter&quot; industry is not well regulated and dolphin deaths (and visitor injuries) are underreported (especially outside the US). Consider the fact that Sea World, one of the most recognized captive dolphin facilities in the U.S, reported 93 dolphin deaths between 1971 and 2002. That\\'s an average of three dolphins per year, assuming that all dolphin deaths were accounted for. These animals are replaced with other captured dolphins. How they go about obtaining dolphins for places like Sea World or Delfiniti is also a concern. No idea on the stats for Delfiniti around dolphin deaths or visitor injuries but if this occurs at Sea World in the US what is happening in a smaller place in Mexico? \\n\\nSuggest a pass on this.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Delfiniti", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/33/11/55/delfiniti.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Boulevard Ixtapa s/n Lote Anexo 6 B, Zona Hotelera", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "40880", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "191889356": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Rip off", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d260087-Reviews-Delfiniti-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/33/11/55/delfiniti.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "They won\\'t let you take pictures, obviously because they want to sell you theirs at 10$ each...

It was very professional and safe.  \\nAs for the dolphins, you\\'re in the water with them for around an hour.  They swim all around you and like your touches.  You get to ride on their belly while they swim on their back.  You get to hug and dance with one.  And the grand finale two of them push your feet and you ride their noses across the pool, really fun.  They end with a bunch of acrobatics.  The pictures are a bit pricey ($8 each, I suggest buying the DVD at $79 since there are no cameras allowed there).  We talked to a neighbor who did the dolphin experience at Sea World and said you barely got to touch the animals (for $50).  This is an absolute steal at $120-150 compared to that.

Check the lobby area of your hotel, there may be a representative\\nthere that will book your trip for you. You can go either 10am-12pm-4pm. He won\\'t take any money up front, you must pay when you arrive. He offered us 20% off the regular rate which was a nice bonus. You will need to have your own transportation. If you hop on the local bus, you can ask the driver to let you off closet to Delfiniti. It\\'s a short walk from the bus stop to the dolphins, they also have taxi-drivers right outside should you chose that route. Before you go, they will ask you not wear sunscreen for the dophins safety. They don\\'t provide towels, so bring one from your hotel. We were super savvy and brought extra dry clothes for the kids to change into afterwards, realizing we were going to shop in Zihua afterwards! They do offer showers to wash off afterwards, however expect OUTSIDE showers with freezing cold water and absolutely barely any privacy. I use the word &quot;however&quot; in my title because I felt the entire experience, aside from being able to interact with the dolphins, rushed and poorly managed.\\nHappy to say I can speak and understand the spanish language so I could understand all the instructions from the folks who work there, there were quite a few people that did not. Finally someone asked them to translate in english, the translation was very broken english and I feel the folks who paid A LOT of money for the 30 minute show didn\\'t get the full experience that the rest who understood the speaker. My son and I did the family experience, which cost 80.00 for the both of us. They strapped on life jackets and led us to a pool where with one dolphin, asked us to get in and attempted to have all of us stand far apart from each other, yet close to the instructor who with hand movements was able to get the dophin to swim near us for us to touch. The ENTIRE time, there were 4 people on the side screaming &quot;LOOK AT THE CAMERA! LOOK AT THE CAMERA!&quot; it was awful.  When it was time for my son to kiss the dolphin the experience was completely shattered by these people who were more interested in snapping a picture for us pay for at the end of the tour and was lost! 10 minutes later, they guided us out of the pool.  My daughter in the meantime was experiencing the Ride with the dolphins show which lasted much longer with more one on one time with them along with the grand finale ride from the two pushing her feet. It was wonderful to see and she had a great time. Afterwards people where just lost as to where to go and what to do, they said they had showers but nobody told anyone where and it seemed as thought all the workers disapeared. I could tell some people were frustrated by lack of communication from the people who worked there. When we went to the front desk to check out the pictures which run from several cameras out front, they ask you to write down which picture you would like to buy ($8.00 a picture or $80.00 for a video). We opted for 3 pictures and not the video. My word of advise is this, if you do this. Ask them right away for an english translation so you can understand it all.Completely ignore the people on the side of the pool screaming at you to look at the camera after you give them ONE shot of you smiling, then focus on the actual experience because it is truly amazing to be so up and close to these sweet dolphins. Bring a towel or plan to go straight back to your hotel to wash off unless you like cold cold showers. Plan ahead if you want to buy the video and let them know right away. A couple told us it would take them 1/2 hour to make the video for them. The pictures took just a few minutes!

It certainly is no \\'CiCi\\' waterpark in Acapulco, now that is a true waterpark for family, friends, couples, has a huge wave pool, lifeguards, &amp; the owner keeps it looking brand new &amp; upgrades slides etc, &amp; you feel safe on their slides. This place should expand &amp; mimic CiCi &amp; it would be a blast for tourists &amp; a goldmine! I hate seeing Ixtapa go down hill. It started with only having all inclusives, losing great restaurants bc of it, &amp; the once gorgeous city go to pot bc Fonatur is not keeping up with it.

Got there, and they expect a tip for grabbing your hand for helping you off the boat.  (Get a real job.)  We went to the snorkeling side of the island and it was a bit wavy.  Of course we start walking to pick out a place to land on the beach, and one guy after another is almost desperately trying to sell us a table (One of whom stated that the conditions were &quot;perfect&quot; for snorkeling).  We do find a place to crash on the far side of the beach to limit the harassment.  (I will come back to this later).  My gal smartly passed on the snorkeling, but I went anyway because it wasn\\'t like were were going to come back anytime soon to experience it.  I snorkeled to one side of the cove, then to the other.  When I reached some coral, There were some nice small fish, a few colorful ones.  Kind of like you would see in a fish tank.  Dummy me, the closer you get to the coral, the wavier it gets, and I got a little scraped up.  That was fine.  I needed a little excitement.  \\nThe one very serious recommendation I have is this:  When you get to the beach, walk past ALL of the guys trying to take your pesos for a table until you get to the last place on the beach, to your right as you face the beach.  There was only one other family sitting at the place having a bite to eat.  No one came out to help (believe it or not, it was a relief at that point.).  One guy was prepping to go snorkeling, and I asked him if there was someone I should talk to, since we were using one of the tables.  He said that he would send someone out.  Anyway, we had the BEST guy come out to take care of us.  Marc Anthony (not kidding) came out and asked what we wanted to drink, gave great advice for snorkeling, and was funny.  He actually but out a bucket of beer in ice and said that we could just pay for whatever we drank.  He checked up on my gal while I was out, and he helped me with my scrapes when I got back.  SUPER COOL GUY.  My only recommendation for this island:  On the snorkeling side, go visit Marc Anthony.

There are some areas in need of care - three or four parts of fairways where grass was killed from flooding a few years ago that have not been repaired. But the tee boxes are in good shape - and greens are in very good condition. The layout of the course is fantastic - challenging, yet fun. And you\\'ll likely see a chameleon or a crocodile. The staff has included the same friendly faces every year (Paco has been driving the beverage cart there 15 or 16 years!) The other course in Ixtapa (Palma Real) gets the majority of the play, understandably. The benefit is that you can play a round at the Marina in 3 hours. If you are only going to play once, and are used to name-brand championship golf courses in more luxurious Mexican vacation destinations such as Cabo - then I might suggest you pass on golf and enjoy other activities. But if you are from a northern area like me (Minnesota), you might enjoy a round in 85 degree sunshine and a light ocean breeze at the Marina.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Marina Ixtapa Golf Club", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/81/55/e6/marina-ixtapa-golf-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo de la Darsena s/n Int.

However, I had played it 12 years ago and it kicked my butt so I wanted some revenge. I arrived early by taxi (7:15 am). It was clear the facilities were somewhat run down. I was told I could head out right away and pay later as the pro shop wasn\\'t open yet. There was a heckuva clatter as I drove over the bridge to the first tee (some wooden slats had been replaced with tree limbs - there were several such bridges throughout the course). However, I never felt unsafe as the main structure of the bridges is steel. I played through a couple on the second hole and after that felt like I had the whole course to myself. I do remember the course being more lush 12 years ago. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the overall condition. The fairways were fine (except one washed out area on the 8th) and the rough wasn\\'t bad at all. No complaints about the greens either - a few had bare spots but that didn\\'t seem to affect the putts. In fact I had 6 one-putts and one 3-putt which is considerably better than my average. I did notice that there was very little sand in the traps, but I was fortunate to have gone in only one (a fairway trap) the whole round. The course design is excellent with a variety of holes. I found it very playable (i.e. not that hard to keep it in play off the tee as long has you aren\\'t too crooked). The finish is as dynamic as it gets with the pretty 154 yard par 3 17th requiring a carry mostly over water where I saw an alligator to add to the excitement. Then their signature hole the demanding 570 yard par 5 18th with water all down the left. I was finished in less than 3 hours. And, it was 34% cheaper than the neighboring Palma Real. About the only negative was that parking brake of my golf cart didn\\'t work, but I managed to get around without it as the course is quite flat. Oh, and I beat my previous score from 12 years ago by 8 strokes adding to my enjoyment. If you are looking for a well-designed, challenging course at good value and are willing to overlook some imperfections, this course will not disappoint.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Marina Ixtapa Golf Club", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/81/55/e6/marina-ixtapa-golf-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo de la Darsena s/n Int.

I played both Ixtapa courses, Ixtapa golf course and the Marina in November of 2017.  While planning my trip I had trouble figuring out which course was which as the names have changed over the years I guess.  There are only two, Ixtapa is at the south end of Ixtapa and the Marina is more North.\\n\\nAnyway, while playing Ixtapa I was talking to Francisco the caddy and he told me &quot;fairway good, rough lose ball&quot; and boy that was the truth.  Apparently they no longer have the equipment to adequately take care of the rough.  I am a 12 handicap, played well and lost three balls that on any other course would have been easily found.  A foot out of the fairway and you are searching.  \\n\\nThe fairways are tight, quite a few dead patches, but playable.  You take your life in your hands crossing the bridges, broken boards have been repaired with tree branches.  Our cart was mostly dead after 14.  I walked in while my wife drove the cart.  I walked faster than the cart.  Greens are fast and mostly really good.  Some great views.\\n\\nEveryone was fantastic.  The staff doesn\\'t arrive until late so Francisco the caddy just had us play and we paid for our round afterward.  The beer cart guy was all over us, probably came by every two holes.  The woman at front desk recommended a restaurant for lunch and called us a cab afterward.\\n\\nThe clubhouse is a fantastic old building and the course has great bones, they just need to throw some money at it.  It is a sad state of affairs but I would play it again.\\n\\nOur cab driver had trouble finding it, there isn\\'t any signage, when you see the tennis courts with the trees growing out of it, you are 20 yards away on the right.\\n\\nAsk for Francisco the caddy, give him your golf schedule and he will meet you at either course.  He says he is about a 10 handicap and was very good with reads and suggestions.  His English is way better than my Spanish.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Marina Ixtapa Golf Club", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/81/55/e6/marina-ixtapa-golf-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo de la Darsena s/n Int.

Unfortunately, this has not happened since the owner, who develops local real estate, has not committed the necessary resources to infrastructure (bunker, fairway repairs and solving the salt water seepage) other than daily maintenance.  Also, the former GM, Tim Sullivan the architect of the course improvements, is no longer there.\\n\\nSo, this leaves the course in the hands of some very dedicated and passionate local works who with limited resources try to make the best with what they have and of Mother Nature ensuring enough rain water to take care of this course located in a normally dry geographic area in the winter.\\n\\nOn the \\u201cPlus\\u201d side-\\n-\\tExcellent caddies and friendly staff\\n-\\tGood price and fast round\\n-\\tChallenging course\\n-\\tFast and frequent beverage cart \\u2026 with good bloody Mary\\u2019s\\n\\nOn the \\u201cMinus\\u201d side-\\n-\\tLack of critical overall investment has clipped the course\\u2019s potential, shame.\\n\\nAs in previous ones, I have divided the review into a variety of topics for a more expanded description:\\n\\nCourse design and layout- upgraded to 4 from 3 stars\\n\\nThe course architect, Robert von Hagge, is an extremely experienced and prolific golf course architect.  He has built many courses around the world with his signature small mound course contour.  \\n\\nOne nice option is that there are four different tee boxes which appeal to a variety of golfing capabilities.  Even though the course it not particularly long, 6700 from the Blue/Championship, 6300 from the white and 5700 from the yellow tees, it demands in accuracy with each shot.  With considerable water on the course and bunkers, you need to plan your shots.\\n\\nFor now, there are no houses on the course (although it is has a plan for this type of development).  Hence, you are playing with a very natural eye-pleasing surrounding.  The abundance of local flora and fauna makes it a great nature preserve for these animals.  Add to this a moister season in 2015 and for these winter months and the greenery is very striking.  \\n\\nThis is the motive for the upgrade.\\n\\nConditions- downgrade to 1.5 from 2.5 stars\\n\\nThe course requires some significant investment of dollars.  The main issue is that the course was built on a mangrove.  Without proper drainage and years soil settlement including the 2014 earthquake of a 7.2 magnitude, the course has serious salt water seepage from the Marina next door.  \\n\\nOn the front nine, the fairways on Holes 5 and 8 (two great holes by the way) are dead zones.  The left side of the green on the second hole is a mosh pit.  While the 9th hole which is visually appealing and requires a target 1st and 2nd golf shot is a \\u201cmess\\u201d from 135 yards into the green.\\n\\nThe back nine seems to have less damage and confined to the fairway of the 12th hole which also will require two well struck shots for a par.\\n\\nThe bunkers are not something you want to get into and are proximate to industrial quarry pits.  Although, after I removed the ubiquitous rocks leaving hard-pan dirt, the shot turned out okay with great backspin.  \\n\\nThe Bermuda greens are properly cared for, fertilized and cut so that the grain is relatively consistent and the roll of the ball is true.  The greater seasonal rain created moister greens so you can aim for the flagstick and your ball will pitch and stop.  Yet, the excess water has caused some damage for instance on the 16th hole.\\n\\nNotwithstanding these serious impediments, you can have a satisfying round.\\n\\nPrice- still 4.0 stars \\u2026 can even add a \\u00bd star due to favorable currency exchange\\n\\nThe course has maintained a very smart policy of multi-round packages for golfers including senior pricing, hotel pricing and twilight rates- Kudos as it is a competitive advantage.\\n\\nThe packages range from 4 to 50 rounds.  I purchased the 4 round package for 3,200 pesos converting to a total of $213 USD or $53 per round.  The stronger USD has its advantages since the actual exchange is more like 18 pesos to the dollar making the price per round $44 USD.\\n\\nIf the package deal is not for you based on your playing frequency and length of stay, you can choose the individual round hotel or twilight rate ranging from $850/$900 pesos, around $56 USD or $77 CAN.\\n\\nI also availed myself of a caddie for all the rounds.  The cost is very reasonable, $300 pesos plus tip.  I would strongly encourage my fellow players to hire a caddie.  Apart from helping the local staff, you are benefitting from local course knowledge, assistance with locating balls (and you will indeed need that) and understanding the greens.\\n\\nPace of Play- still 4.5 stars\\n\\nThe pace of play was excellent.  Perhaps given the course condition which has (unfortunately) scared off golfers, I found very few golfers.  Although in prior years\\u2019 visits, I never found there to be an issue.  If one tees off in the morning between 7/8am, it is nice and cool.  Yet, do not discount the afternoon 2pm tee times and later tee times to benefits from the refreshing ocean breeze.\\n\\nStaff- 4.5 stars\\n\\nAll the staff is very friendly and welcoming.  My caddie, Marana\\', was superb and a quite a philosopher.  The beverage cart frequently makes the rounds and has plenty of choice in drinks with strong bloody Mary\\u2019s!\\n\\nIn summary, do not discount this course altogether since it does have its merits, variety and enjoyment.  My golf game rewarded me with 5 birdies on one round to three triples on another!  \\n\\nBut that\\u2019s golf and why we continue to come back.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Marina Ixtapa Golf Club", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/81/55/e6/marina-ixtapa-golf-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo de la Darsena s/n Int.

The route to the first tee took us over one of several rickety bridges on the course that we always felt were in danger of collapsing.  Someone on the first hole offered to sell us beverages, but that was the last we saw of any staff till we finished.  My cart had bald tires and squishy brakes.  My companions\\' cart had no brakes.  The condition of the course would be improved if they turned it over to a herd of goats.  I challenge you to find a local muny in the States in worse condition.

I had played the course 4 years ago and loved the layout but did not play it again over my past 2 visits to Ixtapa due to the reviews and &quot;word of mouth&quot; that the course was in poor shape. I ended up playing all my rounds at the Palma Real Course (including once more this past week) I had been following the reviews of the Marina course over this last year and was very impressed by Tim Sullivan\\'s (the Marina Course General Manager) comments and answers in regards to the condition of the course and the work that they were putting into the course to try and get it back to being a very good golf course. Tim was always very &quot;up front&quot; about the conditions and challenges for the course and always answered the difficult questions he was being asked. \\nI have to say that it was a real pleasure to play the Marina Course again. The fairways were in good shape and the greens were outstanding the day we played! The bunkers definitely needed some work, but this is very easily said about the Palma Real Course as well! (and all of the greens at the Marina were a ton better than the Palma Real as well) The back 9 had a few holes/fairways where there was still some damage and cleanup needed due to the large storm a few months ago, but they are working on that as there were workers out on the course tending to the cleanup. \\nWe had 3 golfers in our group ( a 7, 10 and 16 handicap) and all 3 of us said that the Marina Course was the highlight of our golfing in Ixtapa this year, and that we should have played all our rounds there. I will definitely be playing the Marina Course in the future, and would recommend that everyone give this great layout another &quot;shot&quot;, because if they don\\'t get the play, we all may be limited to only the one choice for Golf in Ixtapa and that will not be good for anyone.\\nThe carts and driving range do need some work, but at this time I would rather have the course put their efforts and resources into the course, and this seems to be what they are doing. \\nWe also found all of the staff very friendly and appreciative of our coming there to play and our caddie Arik, was outstanding and probably saved everyone at least 4-5 strokes on the greens. I did also get to meet Tim Sullivan, as he was out on the course visiting and talking to the golfers so I believe that he is trying his best to ensure that the improvements to the course continue on.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Marina Ixtapa Golf Club", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/81/55/e6/marina-ixtapa-golf-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo de la Darsena s/n Int.

Each year we purchase a package and play as often as we like.\\nUnfortunately, over the past few years we\\'ve noticed a continuing deterioration of the course. This, we believe, is no reflection on the laborers and management but is more a reflection on the world economy -- especially the US, Canada and Mexico.\\nWe\\'ll be returning once again this year (2014) on April 7 and sincerely look forward to playing the Marina course. Sadly, the prospect that the course may be closed indefinitely or permanently is disturbing to us and we, of course, hope that neither is the case. The caddy masters are great, friendly and helpful and the reception we receive every time we play the course is unmatched. This in comparison to the Palma Real course which is owned and operated by FONATUR, the huge Mexico tourism conglomerate. Additionally, management is no where near as friendly and accommodating as at the Marina course. Palma Real has been through several &quot;new&quot; managers and can\\'t seem to hold onto the good ones. The fact that FONATUR doesn\\'t appear to care the slightest whether anyone plays or not and that they insist on maintaining the $1,200. peso green fee plus cart fee keeps us away.

They were in bad shape. The putter was probably even older then the clubs. The cost to rent the clubs was 455 peso. That was around 40 dollars.

Beyond the beaches, the local residents are very genuine, helpful and gracious.  While we regularly stay at the Club Med, this trip we did a little more \\u201cexploring\\u201d than a sedentary vacation.  Naturally, our vacations have a golf theme as I carry a 4 handicap index and take advantage of the opportunity to play.  Among the many activities, I thought that I would give Marina Ixtapa Golf a try.  \\n\\nIt should be noted that there is a new General Manager, Tim Sullivan, at the Marina Ixtapa Golf Club.  In the two/three months of his arrival, he and his team have made noticeable strides and improvements to the otherwise abandoned course.  More details on this in the review.\\n\\nSo, let\\u2019s begin:\\n\\nCourse design and layout- 3 stars\\n\\nThe course architect, Robert von Hagge, is an extremely experienced and prolific golf course architect.  He has built many courses around the world.  It was on my second visit to Marina Ixtapa Golf that I realized he designed it.  I played on three of his famous courses: one in Miami, Doral Gold and in Montego Bay, Jamaica- Rose Hall Cinnamon Hill Plantation and the Ritz Carlton White Witch.  They are spectacular in all ways.\\n\\nAt Marina Ixtapa there are four different tee boxes which appeal to a variety of golfing capabilities.  The three times I played there I was able to play twice from the Blues (74.1 and slope 138) and once from the Whites (71.8 and a slope of 130).  The course is not particularly long with 6,700 yards from the tips.  Yet, what it lacks in length, it demands in accuracy.\\n\\nThe fairways are very narrow and have the omni-present mounds (lomitas) in the rough which make for very uncomfortable lies.  Couple this with at least 75 bunkers throughout the course and it will make for a very demanding round.\\n\\nOn the front, I found the 5th hole, uphill par 4, the 7th, a 211 yard par 3 and the 8th, a target driver and second shot par 5 very stimulating.  As to the back, a three hole sequence of the 11th, par 3, the 12th tough uphill par 4 and an into the wind delicate par 4 can wreck havoc to your score card.\\n\\nConditions- 2.5 stars\\n\\nIt is evident that Tim and his crew have focused on some key priorities throughout the course.  First and foremost the greens and tee boxes are showing results from some good TLC (tender-loving-care).  The Bermuda greens are properly cared for, fertilized and cut so that the grain is becoming more consistent and the roll of the ball is true.  On some greens there are harder and firmer areas than on others.  Yet, you can aim for the flagstick and your ball will pitch and stop.  \\n\\nThis is the most immediate and apparent enhancement to the course.\\n\\nThe tee boxes are being cut, mowed and watered.  The improvements here will take a little more time to take hold and be as noticeable as the greens.\\n\\nPeculiar to this course which was built on a mangrove, is the seepage of salt water into several holes from the marina.  In particular, holes 5 and 8 and 12, they are dedicating efforts to rebuild these areas that have high concentrations of salt where no grass can grow.\\n\\nAccording to Tim, there are numerous other significant projects that will need attention from irrigation to the bunkers (which are true hazards for your clubs since they are rock quarries).\\n\\nPrice- 4.0 stars\\n\\nI should have purchased a package (they are available in options of 4 or 5 rounds) but with our other activities/excursions I wanted golf to be the filler.  So, I paid for each of my three rounds separately.  A little shy of $1,000 pesos provided you greens fee, plus the cart plus 50 range balls.\\n\\nI also availed myself of a caddie for two of the three rounds.  The cost is very reasonable, $25 plus tip.  I would strongly encourage my fellow players to hire a caddie.  Apart from helping the local staff, you are benefitting from invaluable local course knowledge, assistance with locating balls (and you will indeed need that) and understanding the greens.  \\n\\nIt is guaranteed to make for a more relaxing and enjoyable round.\\n\\nPace of Play- 4.5 stars\\n\\nThe pace of play was excellent.  The two rounds as a single were completed in three hours while the round as a foursome was completed in 4:45.  This was slightly longer than expected because we stopped (three times) to let singles and a twosome pass through.\\n\\nPlease be mindful of this golf rule so that all can enjoy a great round.  In several instances, as a single, I had to wait towards the 14th hole due to slow play.  Yet, you should know that the tee times (unlike Palma Real) are not cross-over times permitting all to start form the first hole and maintain great momentum.\\n\\nStaff- 4.5 stars\\n\\nThe staff is very friendly and welcoming.  My caddie, Mara, was superb and a philosopher too.  The beverage cart frequently makes the rounds and has plenty of choice in drinks. \\n\\nWith Tim\\u2019s leadership, the re-invigorated existing team, the small but necessary improvements, future significant monetary investments in the course should make Marina Ixtapa a strong golf attraction in the area.  \\n\\nI am looking forward to returning next year to see how much has positively changed.  The current trajectory is certainly most encouraging.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Marina Ixtapa Golf Club", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/81/55/e6/marina-ixtapa-golf-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo de la Darsena s/n Int.

Each time the reviews have applauded Marina and slammed Palma Real. So I had always played only Marina but always thought what I could see of Palma Real from the street looked far superior. This trip I took the time to play both. \\n\\nI am fully convinced that the positive reviews on this site for Marina Golf have to be coming from folks with a financial stake in the Marina course. \\n\\nLet\\'s start with the Marina course:\\n&quot;Goat pasture minus the goats&quot; pretty much sums it up. There are barren patches in the middle of most fairways, weeds thick in the &quot;sand&quot; traps, more like rock traps, the greens are very coarse and slow. The carts are likely third generation hand me downs. It is still a viable golf course though. It has 18 full size golf holes but they are crammed in behind and across the street from the hotels on the beach. You are actually playing along the mangroves and stinky ditches that hold brackish water and alligators (those I don\\'t mind, they add local flavor).\\n\\nThe staff:\\nIf you are lucky enough to find someone in the golf shop, they will likely make you feel like you have just been taken advantage of by the time you walk out. They quote you in US dollars but then convert everything in to Pesos using a ridiculous exchange rate then MAKE YOU pay in Pesos. Nevermind if you wish to purchase a souvenir. Nothing, NADA, ZILCH is for sale in the Pro shop.\\n\\nIf you play Marina, you are basically getting in 18 holes and paying for the longitude and lattitude.\\n\\nLike I said, I played Palma Real as well on this trip. It was in very good, not exceptional shape. A local told me later that it had recently been mowed or we would not have been able to find our balls outside of the fairway. This was not the case when we played. It was beautiful. It was challenging. The carts were well maintaned. The caddies were very helpful. The beer cart came around on a regular basis and even ran a tab for us rather than demand payment for each round of drinks. Lots of alligators. Let the caddy look for your ball! The Pro shop did not have any merchandise either but the staff was actually helpful in trying to save us money by proactively demonstrating that we could pay less if we combine our rounds in to a package and pay up front. This proved to save us quite a bit and coming back 2 days later even without our proof of purchase was not an issue.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "1"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Marina Ixtapa Golf Club", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/81/55/e6/marina-ixtapa-golf-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo de la Darsena s/n Int.

There are two strong positives. First, the course has a very interesting layout that\\'s very beautiful in its way. There are doglegs, hazards and forced carries. Lies in the fairways are very tight with sparse grass overlying mud near the watered greens. Second, the greens roll well. They have considerable interest, many are large allowing for a number of interesting hole locations. The greens will hold shots. Another positive is that you can always get on the course. It appears to me they have maybe 20 people a day play the course, so you feel like you have it to yourself. Carts are inconsistently maintained. Test the brakes.\\n\\nAs for negatives, much of the course is brown and dusty. It\\'s not only from lack of water, because the course is watered. It\\'s more of a drainage problem. Some areas are muddy. There are no rakes in bunkers. There are no ball washers.\\n\\nThe pro-shop contains about 6 hats, no shirts and little equipment. It looked like they had a few gloves. Don\\'t ask for a clean, dry towel.

Made a tee time for December 2nd @8 a.m. all of a sudden when we show up the price is $89 (S) $99 (regular). This year he has also eliminated packages.  The owner apparently does not care about the feedback that his staff gets from loyal customers and has told them not to bother him with the reactions of long term customers. In our case 14 years in a row, in other cases at least 50 rounds a year over more than a decade. We played it on the 2nd, only because we were there, but packed up our clubs, said good bye to all of our dear friends that we have made at the course. Apparently many other have done the same and the staff are very understanding of our decision as their hands are tied, the owner is not allowing them to try and rectify the situation.

The prices here are better.  When you are quoted a price, the price includes a cart.  Palma Real cart is extra.  The package rate gives you the best price.  Overall the course layout is nice.  They do have some challenging holes.  Hole 1 is a Par 5.  Easy hole to par if you stay out of the traps that are in front of green.  Hole 2 is a short Par 3.  You do want to be long and in the trap behind the right of the green.  The 3rd Hole is a dog left up the hill.  If the pin is in the back use an extra club.  It is a 2 tier green.  The 4th hole aim for the 150 marker.  Do not try to go any further.  Right is water and any thing much further the fairway narrows.  The 5th is slight dog leg left, aim to the right of the fairway trap.  Green has traps in front.  The sixth hole is fairly simple.  Keep it right and let the ball roll back to the fairway.  The 7th hole is a Par 3.  Depending upon the tee and pin placement you may have a 180 yard carry over sand.  The 8th hole long Par 5.  Long hitters, beware you can reach the lagoon with your drive.  Critical third shot into the green is needed.  The ninth hole is guarded by the lagoon on your left and a fairway trap on your right.  Your second shot is over water.  The 10th hole a dog leg right.  If you push your drive right you are in the driving range.  Beware of the traps on your left with your second shot.  The 11th hole a short par 3.  Green can be tricky.  The 12th hole is a dog leg right.  Hit the ball straight, stay out the touble on the right and behind the green.  The 13th hole is a long Par 4.  Aim for the traps on the right and draw the ball back to the fairway.  Green slopes normally right to left.  The 14th hole - short Par 4.  I believe ther are 10+ traps on this hole.  Aim fir the 100 yard marker and hope your short game good.  The 15th hole, you have an option to fade your tee shot over the lagoon , if you are long hitter to begin with.  Distance off the tee is not as important than keeping the ball right and out of the lagoon.  The 16th hole, is a dog leg left.  Aim for the 150 marker.  You do not want to be left of the marker.  The 17th hole a short par 3 over water.  Accuracy counts here.  The 18th hole, is unreal.  Long Par 5.  Hit your drive safe up the middle.  Stay away from the lagoon on the left and the fairway mounds on the right.  2 of the mounds have traps also.  The second shot aim for the 150 marker.  Accurate 3rd shot is required to the green.  My only complaint about the Marina course are the cart paths and 2 or 3 fairways.  Some tender loving care would make this course a gem.  Though the course may not have the scenery of Palma Real, I enjoy the course and the challenges it offers.  When you are there, say hello to Paco, one of the the beverage cart guys.  He used to caddy for me at Palma Real and would appreciate the opportunity to swing a club if offered.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Marina Ixtapa Golf Club", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/81/55/e6/marina-ixtapa-golf-club.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo de la Darsena s/n Int.

My momma taught be to keep my yap shut if I can\\u2019t say anything nice. But, If I can save someone else from wasting time here... hope you understand mom. Anyway, first, several young men helped us off the water taxi then demanded tips. I mean actually holding onto my arm, not letting go, and demanding $1. And, there were at least 4 of them who continued to follow us yelling about tips for each of them all the way down the cement dock. Happy to tip the captain as that\\u2019s customary, but seriously I had to jerk my arm away. Second, we went to the snorkel beach. Had great service for a couple beers. Beautiful beach. Then came time to pay and the price was much more than was on the sign. When we asked if the tip was included, which would have been completely understandable, we were told no. So... I\\u2019m not sure why an establishment would have a big sign advertising prices and then charge significantly more. Third, left the snorkel beach to check out the other beaches. BIG. MISTAKE. They do not like gringos here. We sat down at 2 different restaurants on the lounge chairs. We were completely ignored. More than 15 minutes, waiters walking by, serving Mexican families next to us, making eye contact, us asking for a menu - all in Spanish mind you - ignored. Finally we tracked down a waiter. He told us we\\u2019d have to pay 1500 pesos per person to stay. We explained we were planning to order food and drinks. He said we\\u2019d still have to pay 1500 pesos per person plus food and drinks. Fair enough the lounge chairs are prime real estate, so we moved inside to a table, as in you are at a restaurant table. We were told we\\u2019d have to pay 500 pesos or $30 for the table. Yeah - that conversion math was way off. Again, we explained we were planning to order food and drinks. Nope. Still $30 per table cover charge. At least this one wasn\\u2019t per person. So we left. Getting on the water taxi was fine. Pleasant boat right ride, etc. Disembarking was the same yelling at you for tips, hanging on to your arm, etc. So... do not go here.

Be leery of the food as many of our party got a stomach infection from the food at the resort. Carry Pepto, tums and antibiotics or the like, if you can. We could not take a dip in the ocean for the waves were 15-20+ feet high and the surf was REALLY rough. Granted, there was a storm in the ocean at the time. Nevertheless, the surrounding landscape wasn\\'t impressive. We had a great time, but I wouldn\\'t go there again. It\\'s the company you keep that really affords you a good time, really. Like other beaches in impoverished areas, stay in the tourist areas unless you can assimilate or don\\'t mind moving away from the lush and catering to of tourists. The surrounding areas, once you left the hotel zone, were poorly kept and appeared abandoned. The time to go, we later learned, is in October/November when the surf allows you to swim in the ocean and during which more frequent boat excursions can take place so that you get to see other nooks and crannies which offer better scenic views and natural wonders along with activities like snorkeling. There aren\\'t much beach activities that I wanted to take part in as they didn\\'t appear very safe. As an example, the one day we could have gone parasailing we learned that you have to run off the beach while tied to the boat and sail in order to gain momentum and speed to be lifted as the boat pulls away. How do you land? Well, the boat slows down enough to loose some of the wind in your sail and directs you to the beach where you have to be ready to touch the ground again while running until you come to a safe stop. No thank you! The water is pretty as you get further away from shore. The sand was a dark beige and as the water gets closer to shore it gets a bit murky.

We did the excursion on our own. We took the city bus outside of our hotel, Sunscape Dorado Pacifico. We paid $1 per person each way for the 5 of us, so $10 total to Playa Linda. We had 3 of our kids with, ages 9, 11, and 17. Just ask to make sure the bus is going to Playa Linda, there should be a sign in bus window. The bus driver took US money. Once arriving at Playa Linda we got off the bus and stopped at the crocodile sanctuary right on the side walk off the bus stop. Then, we turned left down a path to the marina, about a 5 minute walk, through a sandy parking lot. At the marina, we paid $3 per  person ($15) roundtrip to the island. Again, we paid in US without any problems. Save your ticket for the return trip, they will ask for it on the way back. They will also remind you to tip on the return trip. We got dropped off at the swimming beach, calmer than the snorkeling side. We were asked to stop at the restaurants on the swimming beach but I will say not hassled, just asked once then left alone. About, 1/4 ways down the beach a gentleman asked us what we were there for and I said snorkeling, he said to follow him to the other side to check it out for snorkeling. He said I could just look, to trust him. So, we walked to the other side, about a 1 minute walk. We were at the Lili Cipraini restaurant which is actually on both sides. This was a great decision! Gustavo was our waiter and we got a table with an umbrella right on the beach. We didn\\'t order food but got 5 bottled waters, 1 soda and 1 famous pineapple drink in the pineapple. It was 305 pesos. We actually paid this bill in pesos. We could have sat there all day. Then, we paid $63 in US for a snorkeling guide for all 5 of us (Luis was awesome) and equipment. It was our kids first time snorkeling and having a guide was perfect and stress free! Luis brought up a blow fish, a sea urchin and a spider star fish for all us to touch! He also took pictures which I bought after for $20. Jimmy, a worker, emailed the pictures to me that night, no problems! We tipped Gustavo and Luis on our own. They were awesome! There are also flush toilets and running water in the bathrooms at this restaurant. We probably got to the island around 11 and left at 2. It was a great way to spend the day and I highly recommend the island and Lili Cipraini&quot;s! The water wasn\\'t as calm as I  expected it to be and the snorkeling beach is VERY full of coral! Water shoes would work well. We didn\\'t have any and did ok but don\\'t expect soft sand! There are cactus on the island and it is neat to see them next to palm trees. There are all of these restaurants on the island right on the beach and if you buy a drink or food you can sit at the table for the day while you enjoy the beach. We had valuables with us (money, phones) and Gustavo said we could put that up by Jimmy to keep safe while we snorkeled and so we did. It was kept safe and absolutely no problems! Thank you to Luis, Gustavo and Jimmy for an excellent day! Oh, the boat ride over was probably only 3-4 minutes long. Go and enjoy!

The name was El Indio and he introduced him self as Oscar, we said we would come back a little later, after we walked around a bit we returned back to his restaurant to enjoy the cheapest corona on the island and we all ate and drank there.\\nGood service, good food and very friendly", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "567941897": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Worth a visit", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is definitely worth a visit. We went with a tour, which was a good way to get to know how things work, but you really could visit on your own. The snorkeling is a bit difficult, as you have to get across rocks and part of the reef to get into the water, but we did see fish. I didn\\'t find anything real interesting like octopus or rays, but there was a reasonable variety of fish. You do have to get a ways off shore before the reef really starts to come alive, those who get nervous in the water may not like it. Stay away from the rocks sticking out of the water on the left side (facing water) as there is a strong current running between them and you will get pulled in and banged up. Don\\'t ask how I know this. The water is clear and warm, but know the tide table because at low tide it may be nearly impossible to get into the water here, the entire portion of the reef where I snorkeled was exposed at low tide. Food and drink are reasonable, and the bathrooms were clean and functional. The swimming beach is top notch. I had heard there were trails to get into the bush to see birds and wildlife, but couldn\\'t find any, and it looks pretty rugged away from the developed area. Have a couple pesos per person available to tip the dock hands, maybe a 5 peso coin for two people, it\\'s reasonable and it beats twisting an ankle or worse getting in and out of the boats.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "567706219": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "To go or not to go?", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We visited Ixtapa Island during our holidays and were in for a surprise...

You then had the snorkel gear for your whole time there.  The kids really enjoyed it and saw a ton of fish!  They spent much of their time in the water around the coral reef diving and watching the fish.\\n\\nLunch: was very fresh with a choice of fish or chicken as the main and included one drink.  Of course, you could order other beverages and food at your own cost.  \\n\\nBeaches: There are three beaches on Ixtapa island, the snorkel beach which has the corral and a small area for sitting in the water.  The arrival beach is where you can swim, as it is much sandier.  I didn\\'t get to the third beach but that is another option.\\n\\nThere are other services available as you could take advantage of a 1hr massage for $20!

There are two sides to the island to enjoy and both get very busy with tourists and locals. I suggest you get there a bit earlier around 10:30am. My teen son and I spent our time exploring both beaches. One has softer sand while the other is more rocky. Water shoes help. There are tons of beach front restaurants with chairs/umbrellas, and you typically can park your stuff for free if you eat/drink at the restaurant. Be sure to check out both beaches to see which you prefer. We chose not to snorkel, although many people did and said it was inexpensive and awesome. We opted to just wade out a few feet and saw tons of fish swimming around our legs. My son got some amazing video and pictures because the water was so clear. On one side of the island, there is a large area of coral that is re-cultivating at the end of the beach and is off limits. Someone is there to whistle you out of the area if you can\\'t read the sign. We enjoyed the best lunch of shrimp, rice, tortillas and headed back around 2:30pm. The boat ride back was just as easy with no wait time, although if you leave later there will be a line-up, especially during peak tourist season. We stopped in at the crocodile/turtle reserve to get some pictures. Unfortunately the &quot;Crocodile Man&quot; (as we call him) was not there. This was a fantastic day and always a nice way to spent a few hours off the resort.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "558468037": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Beautiful Island with great snorkeling", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Beautiful island with tonnes of restaurants and a swimming and snorkeling area.

However, a quick trip across the water from the pier at Playa Linda to Ixtapa Island is an enjoyable and inexpensive day trip, and helps beat the monotony of your all inclusive resort.  My recommendation is not to book an excursion at your resort because it is just way too easy to get there on your own.  \\n\\nWe stayed at Club Med Ixtapa.  A bus ride to Playa Linda is the way to go from wherever you might be in Ixtapa, forget the taxi.  It was only 8 pesos one way by bus from Club Med or about a 15 minute walk.  Once you get to Playa Linda, you walk over to the pier where they sell ferry tickets for 50 Pesos per person, and it is a return ticket.  Do not lose the stub they give you for the return trip. At Playa Linda there are a number of booths that sell all kinds of trinkets and beach items. Once you land at the island, walk straight in front of you to the other side of the island, about a 30 second walk, to Playa Coral.  The other beaches are primarily for swimming, but not much shade anywhere if you aren\\'t under a palapa or if you don\\'t have your own umbrella.\\n\\nWe brought our own snorkelling gear because I can\\'t speak to the disinfection techniques of the snorkel equipment by the mom and pop operations/restaurants on the island.  Infectious diseases could be passed along easily, and it wasn\\'t a risk I wanted to take.  A mask and snorkel is really all thats necessary if you don\\'t have fins, and they do sell them at playa Linda.  You just need to be able to look into the water when swimming around the island.\\n\\nIts best to get to the island early in the morning, when the waters are the clearest as too many people can really kick up the sand.  Upon arriving at the island you may be approached by local businesses offering you drinks, food and a palapa.  You will definitely need a shady palapa as there are no trees to shade you on the beach of Playa Coral, and it really heats up there unless you are in the water.  \\n\\nWe stayed at the Princess Rebeca location on the beach.  Ismail (tel. 7551117973) speaks English and can even arrange private deep sea fishing tours (which can be really pricey if you book from your resort).  He can even set you up with a guide to take you snorkelling for 30 pesos per person.  However, we were there early and opted for the Coronas at 30 pesos each and left a tip for the palapa use.\\n\\nBe careful when ordering your pina coladas here.  The people around us did so and received what appeared to be an edible pina colada pineapple arrangement for 150 pesos a piece.  I\\'m sure they tasted great--they looked great too.\\n\\nSome caveats when visiting the island.  The beach is very thick and  sandy as the hunks of coral have broken down over time.  In fact, the coral on the beach in places can be sharp and uncomfortable.  The sand as you approach the water is so porous that your feet will sink in...it is not the dense hard water packed sand you normally find on the other beaches.  There is no gradual descent into the water...so be careful if you are there with kids and keep them within arms reach.  In fact, kids should have a life jacket on unless they are older than 11 or 12 and are strong swimmers.  The waves here can easily knock you off balance if you aren\\'t watching, especially as you navigate amongst the coral.  I would not visit this island if there are lots of big waves on the sea that day as it could ruin your ability to get into the water easily or see anything from stirring up the sand. The shoreline is variable when it comes to water depth, so in places you can stand easily and others it drops off. Its very important to stay in the middle and avoid the rocks which are on either end of the beach.   But when you start snorkelling, the noise of the beach disappears and you are in a wonderful underwater world.  The island doesn\\'t have a huge variety of fish compared to the Caribbean, but nonetheless it is so peaceful underwater and enjoyable to have fish swimming alongside you.  We didn\\'t see the puffer fish but they do exist here.  We did see a sea urchin, a sea snake and various other fish. \\n\\nA couple of hours here is really all that is needed unless you want to stick around and eat.  We opted to head back to the resort for a late lunch as we were there with our 3 kids aged 11, 13 and 16 and they aren\\'t fish lovers.  However, I\\'ve read that the fish is really great at the restaurants on the island, so worth a try.  The Princess Rebeca does serve drinks with the safe ice...when we were there they served us coronas because the safe ice hadn\\'t arrived yet.  \\n\\nOverall this is an excursion you should not miss especially if you stay in the vicinity of Club Med.  My husband was afraid of snorkelling before we came here and is now talking about going snorkelling again our next visit.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "555262807": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "A Good Adventure", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A great morning away from the resort.

The snorkel site is the same no matter how much you pay. \\n\\nThe expensive way is to take an organized excursion from your hotel, for perhaps $80 US per person. We did the cheap way, and you can too. Here\\u2019s how.\\n\\nWe took a taxi from our hotel in Ixtapa to Playa Linda. Cost 130 pesos for the four of us, plus a 20 peso tip.  \\n\\nAt Playa Linda you walk through an area with lots of stalls selling things like T shirts and beach stuff. Keep walking along until you get to the end of a pier (it\\u2019s to your left). It\\u2019s about a 5 minute walk. If you\\u2019re not sure where to go, a friendly Mexican will be delighted to show you the way, no doubt hoping for a tip. (Today you will have all that popularity you dreamed about in high school.) We found our own way with no difficulty. \\nAt the end of the pier you pay 50 pesos per person for the round trip ferry boat to the island. Save the receipt for the return journey. The boat ride lasts about 10 minutes, and the boats run all the time. I really mean all the time. As soon as one boat is pulling out, another one is pulling in, or there may even be more than one there at the time. They are cute little 12-passenger boats. Tipping the boat driver and the man who helps you off the boat is optional. \\n\\nOnce you get off the boat, you walk straight up the beach away from the water and across the island. This takes at most 2 minutes; the island is really narrow at this point. Don\\u2019t worry, you can\\u2019t go the wrong way. Directly across the island from where you got off the boat is Playa Coral, where the snorkelling is. \\n\\nNow you need to choose a restaurant. Or it will choose you. All along the beach are restaurants with tables and chairs, and sun loungers. If you want to order food, the table and sun loungers will be free for as long as you want them. If you don\\u2019t want to order anything, or just want drinks, ask the price of the table. (At the first restaurant they wanted 200 pesos for the table if we didn\\u2019t order anything. This seems quite fair; after all, these people do need to make a living.) We walked along the beach to the far end and sat at the last restaurant there. We just wanted drinks and to rent one lifejacket, and were told there would be no charge for the table. \\n\\nWe were given menus, and the prices were really reasonable. A Coke was 20 pesos, my really fancy lemonade 40 pesos, the most expensive alcoholic drink 80 pesos, and a full meal about 150 pesos. You can rent snorkel gear from the restaurants for 150 pesos, and a lifejacket for 60-70 pesos. (We brought our own snorkel equipment.)\\n\\nTo snorkel you walk to a place around the middle of the beach to get in and out of the water \\u2013 it\\u2019s sandy here. You shouldn\\u2019t enter anywhere else because there\\u2019s coral at the bottom, and if you step on it you will damage the coral and help to destroy the area. Instead of a lifeguard, this place has a coral guard who keeps asking ignorant tourists to get off the coral so they don\\u2019t kill it. It takes a really long time for coral to grow, and only a moment to break it. Please help preserve this beautiful place by not touching anything in the water. \\n\\nYou will see fish right away, swimming around your legs as you enter the water, even before you put your mask on. \\n\\nOnce in the water, swim out from shore a bit and head to the right. Playa Coral is in a bay with few waves. The water is really clear once you get away from the sandy area at the shore, and the fish and coral are beautiful. There are tons of different types of fish. You will love it! You will see other people following roughly the best path. Stay in water deep enough that you won\\u2019t accidentally scrape the coral with your fins, and you won\\u2019t scrape your body either; coral can be sharp. \\n\\nIf you get there early in the morning before the tourist groups arrive you will have the place mostly to yourself, but it was fun even after they got there. \\n\\nThere are no fresh water showers on the island, though there are some at Playa Linda. \\n\\nThe cost for our day \\u2013 2 taxi rides 300 pesos (with tips), 4 ferry fares 200 pesos total, restaurant bill for 3 drinks, 1 lifejacket rental, and tip - 180 pesos. 680 pesos altogether for a trip for four people.

Personally, don\\'t be hesitant to let one of the \\'guides\\' walk you over there and offer you a seat. Yes they will constantly come around and ask you if you want lunch, and will bring fish to your table on a platter and ask you if you are ready for lunch. If you don\\'t want it, just say no gracias. It\\'s worth the \\'pestering\\' (if you want to call it that) in order to get a place to sit with an umbrella. We ordered a few drinks and tipped our \\'guide\\' and in the end everyone was happy.\\n2) we snorkeled on the Gulf side in a cenote (Yal-Kul) by Akumal and this area, by comparison was not as well kept, the fish aren\\'t as colourful. If you haven\\'t been snorkeling in Mexico before you will be amazed - because snorkeling in the tropics is amazing, but if you have been on the other side, like we have, you will be underwhelmed and maybe a bit disappointed by amount the garbage in the water (cigarette butts, plastic bits). I worry that the state isn\\'t taking a harder line on the damaging ecological impacts of simple things like littering and using drug store sunscreen (in Yal-Kul you have to use eco-friendly screen or shirts)  Even with some simple education and just a little enforcement, conditions there could be much improved.\\n3) in spite of the above, we had a fun day there with the kids. Access was very easy. I\\'m glad I read several reviews that indicated it wasn\\'t necessary to buy a tour package here - it\\'s true. We took a bus from our hotel to Playa Linda - very easy - 12 pesos per person. Walked from the bus stop to the pier (past the crocodile reserve so you can actually see massive lizards and crocs thru this chain link fence). Took a water taxi from the pier - return trip is 50 pesos per person. Simple.

Most make the day of it, including catching a fish right there and cooking it on the island for your lunch. Check with your concierge or at the Zocalo (main town square) in Zihua.

We went on a guided snorkelling excursion (you hold a boogie board and the guide pulls you around.) If you are looking for bright and colourful coral and fish, you will be disappointed with the snorkelling. This area of Mexico has more muted colours (beiges &amp; browns etc) and no wildly exotic species. The experience was good, but I would save snorkelling for somewhere like Hawaii. After snorkelling we all partook in beach massages, which were very enjoyable! There are multiple tents for massages on the beach, and are all reasonably priced. We did have an issue with the vendor we chose making comments about the amount we tipped (more than 10%) but if you keep in mind that they may be snarky about tipping, you won\\'t be surprised. We had lunch at one of the restaurants (unfortunately I cannot remember the name) and it was neither good nor bad. After lunch we had an excellent time\\njust playing out in the water and swimming around, this beach is very lovely and it wasn\\'t too crowded. My main issue with my excursion to the island was the pushiness of the men driving and moving passengers on and off the boats. They stood there and held out their hand to help you on the boat (which I declined on the way there and back) and they become very aggressive about being tipped. My family of 8 gave them $5 CAN (in pesos) on the way there and then felt on the way back we did not need to tip again. I was the last one of the boat, and the man proceeded to shout in my face (I am a 23 year old female) about not having a tip. I tried to ignore it but he got very close to me and continued to shout. I also noticed that he did not bother the Mexican family that was on board with us both times and they never tipped. If you are going to Ixtapa island make sure that you know they will harass you for tips and be prepared to be firm if you are declining to leave one. At the end of the day, other than the boat journey, it was an enjoyable day and I would recommend it if you are visiting Zihua!

We found it was just best to walk out across the street and hop on the Playa Linda bus for 24 pescos. Once at Playa Linda walk to the end of the pier and purchase your water taxi tickets 100 pescos return for a couple.

On the weekends however it can fill up quite early as families come out to enjoy the island. Just over the hill is the other 2 beaches another swimming beach and a snorkel beach on the south side of the island. During our stay we visit the beach at least 3 times a week, where we are meet by our friend Armando who works at Restaurant Cuachalalate (orange umbrellas) on the first beach and even after 3 years away he remembered who we were. We were welcomed with smiles and big hugs as we approached the restaurant and quickly set up with ocean side loungers and a bucket of cold beer.  The food is great our favorite was the coconut shrimp which was big enough to share with 6 large butterflied shrimp, rice, salad and fresh tortillas.

We could see the island from our bedroom and walked about a quarter of a mile on the beach to the pier to take the boat. The boat only cost 80 Mexican Pesos round-trip which is around four dollars. The downside is safety on the crossing since they put way too many people than allowed for the size of the boat. The boat clearly stated outside that only 10 people are allowed yet there were 18 people in the boat we went both ways, which creates a safety issue. However the sea is very calm and the mariners on the boat were going slowly to avoid any problems and I must admit that they are very experimented in these trips, it did make us a little uneasy. If you\\'re not a good swimmer then pay the extra money to take a private boat. There is not much to do around the island other than some nice beaches and a couple of small restaurants but is very rustic.

The same on the way back so they were asking for tips 4 times. \\n\\nAs soon as we came to the island one person started to follow us everywhere.  At first we went to the snorkelling side just to see how it looks like. As soon as we came there the same person told me that I can relax on the lounge.  As soon as I set on that lounge he ran after menu and gave it to me. I told him that we are not going to stay on snorkelling side, we want to go to Varadero beach. He said no problem and while we were walking to another beach he was following us. We were really annoyed by that person and we decided to just  relax on the sand so restaurant people don\\u2019t bother us, but it wasn\\u2019t an option. All island was covered with restaurants and ocean waves were up to the restaurant\\u2019s lounges so the only option was to use their lounges.  \\nThe guy who was following us pointed to the lounge at Varadero beach. As soon as I set there he once again ran for the menu and gave it to me. We didn\\u2019t want anything, we came to the island after all-inclusive breakfast, but the same guy was waiting for us to order something. So we ordered three drinks.  When he finally left us alone I was trying to swim at the beach, but there were so many boats and there was such a heavy smoke from that boats that I couldn\\u2019t breathe.  So I told to my husband that I can\\u2019t stand this smell anymore and we decided to go to the end of the beach because there weren\\u2019t any boats.  As soon as we came to the end of the beach guess what\\u2026. yes, another waiter started following us because now it was another restaurant area : ) He pointed to the lounge and of course in couple seconds I was holding another menu and we ordered another 3 drinks. \\nWhen we came back from the island I was happy that it is over. It feels so good when no one following you. By the way I came back from that island without my camera. It was missing.

So if you want to visit this place make sure to look after your staff.\\n\\nThis island could be potentially a nice place to relax, but restaurants spoiled this island.

I didn\\'t have anything to eat or drink because many people at our hotel had warned many of us that people had got sick there and that the filtered water and ice situation was not good. (I simply drank bottled beverages and I was fine to eat back on the mainland. I am experienced with travel and did not see this as a big problem, but I have become sick before and am cautious now.) I enjoyed walking around the island. \\n\\nIt\\'s only 40 pesos for the ferry, so this is a very affordable day trip or even a half-day trip. It is a short ferry ride, so you can even just go over for an hour, if you like. I enjoyed my time and spent a couple of hours there with some other people from my hotel. The water and beach were beautiful and the water was much more clear than on the mainland.\\n\\nI am not sure that I was that much happier than I would have been on one of the local beaches. I think my experience was a bit muddy because I was so unsettled by the life jacket situation on the ferry. No one else was wearing them and the one I found was undersized - that was on the way there, but I felt I could handle that. There were lots of life jackets available and things felt safe. On the way back, there were no life jackets at all - not under seats, not anywhere I could see.  The ferry had to turn around when we were halfway -- to get more passengers because the waves were too big and the captain was worried about stability. When we got back, we slammed into the dock and I nearly hit my head on it - the covering behind me was not solid and I was thrown to one side. I found out later that another tourist at our hotel reported that her small ferry had overturned a couple of days earlier and she had been thrown into the water. That being said, I would simply recommend that you make sure there is a life jacket available before you get on. Obviously, some boats have them and my first boat seemed a better choice for others reasons too. I don\\'t expect everything in another country to be like home but I think travelling that distance over water is a risk and that people should be aware.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "358729869": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Watch your bill !!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Went there for the afternoon with another couple.

If you book a tour from the hotel make sure everything is spelled out i.e. does the price you pay include snorkeling gear, lunch etc. Get it in writing on the receipt and verify the receipt actually has the amount you have paid for the tour and not a reduced rate. You can also do it cheaper by taking a taxi from the hotel and paying the 40 pesos for the boat ticket to cross over to the island. You can rent your snorkeling gear from the island for around 350-500 pesos. You can also bring your own snorkeling gear which I highly recommend. You really do not require life vests unless you are not a swimmer.\\nThe travel time from the hotel zone in Ixtapa to Isla Ixtapa is about 25 -30 minutes. Once you arrive you walk on to the pier about a 10 minute walk from where you got off your vehicle to take the boat ride to the island. Boats arrive one after the other, so the wait time is not too long. I recommend wearing a hat as there is no shade on the Pier. Boat swains and others around help you get in and get off the boat so it should not be a huge concern. The boat ride is not a bumpy ride as I have experienced with other snorkeling destinations. It\\'s about a 10 minute boat ride to the island. Be prepared to see lots of Pelicans diving in for fish or waiting around the Pier. Once you get on to the island, the side you get off is the swimming beach. You walk 5-10 minutes across the island to the other side which is the snorkeling beach. Both sides of have restaurants. When we went the restaurants and the beaches were packed as it was a holiday week for Mexican nationals. \\nOur tour included a lunch which was very basic, and was not very good. The wait staff bring around a fresh off the boat fish platter and ask you if you want to pay extra for Red Snapper, Lobster, large Prawns etc. I recommend you bring lots of pesos to order extra sea food and drinks. \\nIf you plan on spending a whole day on Isla Ixtapa or even just half a day, I highly recommend getting a massage here. I did, and it was worth every peso I paid for it. I only had time for a half hour massage which cost me 300 pesos which roughly translates to about US$18.00. One of our group members had a three hour massage!!!\\nWe had a guide take us snorkeling. I would say that the snorkeling itself is average. We saw many colorful fish as well as a bright orange puffer fish, and it is great fun for youngsters. After snorkeling we went over to the other side of the island to swim. The swimming beach is great as it is on a bay and there are hardly any waves. It\\'s a calm ocean and you can swim for hours.\\nIsla Ixtapa is a great place to spend a lazy day, and I highly recommend trying it at least once if not more on your vacation to Ixtapa.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "358258079": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Short little visit", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Took a Kayak Tour with the Azul Ixtapa Resort.

The first time the tide was out which made it easier to navigate in to the water to snorkel and larger area to walk along the beach and pick shells ect. The second time there the tide was in which made the beach more narrow and crowded. There is quite a slope on the beach in to the water so with the tide in it really crowded things. There are restaurants all along the beach on both the swimming and snorkelling side and both places we went had their place on both sides so you could snorkel on one side then come over to the other for swimming. They would bring your stuff from one side to the other and keep a tab until you are ready to go. Beer was cheap, 20 pesos each. Pina colada was not, about 80 pesos and only average. We only ate fries while there but there are many options. You can rent snorkel gear there but we came with our own stuff.

The water was a great deal clearer on the island but still churned up a bit in places, I have seen much clearer but it was still good and a good variety of fish.

Snorkelling was not possible as the waves were churning up the sea floor and the visibility was poor. Fun beach to explore though. Loved the water taxi ride, slow, cruisy and super helpful staff.

We were heading for the harbor, and the island.\\n\\nOnce we arrived at Isla Ixtapa, it was a short walk across to the ocean side, where the reef draws snorkelers.

We ordered drinks, the proprietor couldn\\'t be kind enough. I read a book, Husband went snorkeling, reported that the rocks were a bit daunting, and the reef was vast and could be confusing. I was glad I stayed on the beach. \\n\\nAll around us, people were ordering thousands of pesos worth of food and drinks. The proprietor suggested a platter for us; about a thousand pesos, and more food than we could have eaten in three days. We decided on fish tacos and nachos, another couple of beverages. \\n\\nProprietor turned cold. We laughed.\\n\\nThe island is truly lovely, and the rough and tumble of the cafe owner was actually a relief from the faux perfection of Ixtapa. \\n\\nWould we go again? Absolutely.

I spoke to some Americans on the Island who had been there several times over the coarse of several years and had always had a good experience. I would like a do over. How to do the island. \\n\\nWe went June 1st, which was a Monday. It was not crowded at all and that part was great. Going in the morning is also much more comfortable due to the lower temperatures.\\n\\nFirst I would highly recommend you know which restaurant you want to go to before arriving. This way you can avoid the hassle of being solicited since you\\'ve already committed yourself to a restaurant. The restaurants also rent snorkel gear if you decide to go.\\n\\nOur mistake.  We arrived by taxi and that part was fine, no issues there. We walked halfway through the market before arriving at the pier and someone wearing a white Ixtapa Island T-shirt asked if we wanted to go to the Island. My mistake? I said Yes. How to avoid my mistake just walk to the pier by yourself and buy your round-trip ticket there. The price is listed, you pay, you get a receipt which you keep for your return trip back. It\\'s straightforward, easy, cheap and not a hassle. \\n\\nThe people on the boats do ask for a tip for their &quot;assistance&quot;. At the exchange rate was 15 pesos to the dollar. 10 pesos is roughly 66 cents, that is nothing to me, but to them it is significant. So anytime you are out and about I would recommend you bring small local currency. I would say tip the boat boy\\'s some small local currency, 25 cents U.S., 60 cents, even if you feel it\\'s a non-service. They greatly appreciate it since of course they are impoverished and it makes the the interaction less uncomfortable and really you\\'re out nothing, so I\\'d say be nice and get over that part.\\n\\nBack to my mistake, I just wanted to relax and enjoy the Island and maybe snorkel if it wasn\\'t too choppy, it turned out to be pretty choppy so we skipped the snorkeling. \\n\\nThe guy who offered to take us to the Island turned out to be a waiter for one of the Island restaurants and of course he was trying to get us to go there. He was up front about this once on the island. I tried to lose him by telling him we were going to hike first and then we\\'d be back. We started hiking and we arrived at a small secluded beach with no buildings and then five minutes later he showed up. I tipped the guy about a dollar U.S. to leave us alone and his &quot;help&quot;, but he came back later in our hike. Part of what compounded my mistake was that not everyone in party was willing to the handle the situation the same. So while I was telling him I wanted to be alone the third person in our party wanted to be friendly and of course that made the guy want to tag along. \\n\\nNot being on the same page with how to get rid of the guy obviously led to me feeling supremely annoyed, frustrated and really not enjoying the Island at this point. \\n(I always felt safe, if annoyed, he was actually nice, but super insistent and therefore supremely annoying.)\\nSo this guy finally did disappear, I was happy, but too tense to enjoy finally being alone. Making this guy disappear turned out to be super easy and it didn\\'t require one word or a tip or anything confrontational. \\n\\nHow did I do it? As we continued our hike we simply walked on to  a third beach, named Coral beach and this guy disappeared immediately and never came back! Why? Because of course the other restaurants would not appreciate him soliciting his restaurant while we are standing or walking past their restaurant. So this turn of events got me what wanted and kept me from blowing a gasket with the guy and the other member in our party.\\n\\nI found a restaurant that some other people I spoke with said they were enjoying, I sat down and tried to figure out how to recover the Ixtapa Island experience. I decided to just have drinks at this restaurant, skip the snorkeling, then get a massage and then head back to our resort. The drinks were great at Paradisio, I never felt pressured there, the waiter was friendly. \\n\\nThe massage was inexpensive and just took the price I was offered, because it was already low (Also I never try to get a local price on anything, I  just ask myself if I think I am getting a reasonable price for something I\\'m interested in. I have never understood tourists who try to nickle and dime the poor in order to get a locals price in order to save a few dollars or cents which I will hardly miss and they greatly need.) The women who give massages are employees of the massage stands and only receive a fraction of the massage money, so of course I tipped them on top of what the massage cost, just like I do when I get a massage in the U.S. The massage was also a good experience and I was able to leave Ixtapa Island on a good note despite the bad start.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "278489719": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Fun, quick day trip", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We took a quick boat ride to the island and enjoyed snorkeling, swimming, and a fresh, delicious lunch.

The waves/water comes up very high so make sure you don\\'t leave your bags and stuff on the beach.

When you get onto the island likely someone will guide you over to the other side to go to the beach. The views and beaches are unreal, the water is so clear and blue and the sand is very clean and white.

The island and beach is not that big so it can get very crowded beacause there is a lot going on in a small area.\\n\\nAnother thing that makes this an unpleasant experience is the amount of Mexican restaurant staff constantly harrrassing you while youre walking on the beach. The food and drinks are overpriced and you get very little amount of food for the cost (also there is a random &quot;service fee&quot; they don\\'t tell you about).  Beers are cheap but just about everything else is very overpriced, we ordered a plate of &quot;nachos&quot; for $7 and it took about 20 minutes, and there was literally 10 chips on the plate.

Took a cab from our hotel. 90 peso\\'s there and 60 back. The cab dropped us off at the market where we were immediately greeted by the shop owners wanting us to take a look. Once we were through the market and on the peer we were swarmed by vendors wanting to escort us to the ticket booth to buy our tickets for the boat taxi. It was a bit overwhelming at first and I would imagine it to being attacked by sharks but now that I know what to expect it wouldn\\'t be an issue for the next time. Turns out the guys on the peer are getting kickbacks from the restaurants on the island so that\\'s the reason for the hustle on the peer. Didn\\'t really matter to me where we went as long as they had cold beer. The island is very small so it\\'s easily walkable if you want to try both beaches. The closer beach is easier to walk on however. We started off at the farther beach and had a couple of beers and did some snorkeling. As I mentioned there is a lot of washed up coral on the beach so I would recommend water shoes if you have. Good snorkeling and some live coral to see. At the time, this was the busier of the two beaches. After that we walked over to the closer beach ( about 4 minutes) and had more beer and nachos. Can\\'t remember the name of the restaurant but it was to the far west side. Washrooms were the worst my wife has ever seen so ladies beware! Again, lots of fish and coral as well as a nice sandy beach. Last boat taxi back to the main land was 5:00pm and again all the attendants were quite aggressive when asking for tips.\\n\\nI would recommend this trip if you\\'re looking for something to do. No need to book an official tour from your hotel though as you will be fine on your own. I believe the cost of this tour from our hotel was $40+ US pp and included lunch and one drink.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "261126444": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Great place to get away from the hotel.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Went over to the Island twice during our one week stay in Ixtapa80m peso taxi ride or 10 peso bus ride to playa Linda then buy a round trip ticket off the pier for 40 peso\\'s round trip.

He pointed out the sights along the way to the &quot;marina&quot; at Playa Linda. We went directly through the market to the little boats and over to the island, across to the snorkelling side and sat in the shade at one of the little businesses as  Mario directed. Someone immediately came and took our lunch order ans set a time to eat ( included with tour) and another to specify how many would be snorkelling. They brought the gear, got everyone set up and off they went! Those of us who did not snorkel were served a pop and the only other person who approached us was selling massage services.

But we still weren\\'t buying! ) not pushy!\\nI don\\'t swim with fish, but those who did had fun and saw lots. If you are a pro, this is probably not your place, but it was good for us! Boogie boards, life vests, guides (who will feed the fish so you can see them) and pretty stringent rules about not standing on the coral (which is good). It was not busy when we were there 11:00am. Maybe 1/3 capacity if that. Would have been a nightmare if all those seats/tables had been full! After snorkelling we switched back to the other side for lunch which was served promptly and was good. Fish or chicken, chips and Guacamole!! (This was the only guacamole I encountered on my vacation sadly. It was great and I had seconds!)\\nAfter eating the kids went for a swim at this side. Calm water and a nice little beach. Also great that it was not busy!\\nOverall a fun day! We were not rushed or left waiting and felt it was well worth the $. 1280 pesos for four snorklers. Total.

We were a fifteen minute walk to the pier where you catch the water taxis to the island so we went there several times during our stay.  Water taxi cost 40 pesos round trip. You buy tickets at a booth a the end of the pier.Please note that the persons helping you on and off the boats will ask for tips so you may want to have some change to give them.  Usually put 6 to 8 persons on a boat.  Water taxis start running between 9 and 10 am.  \\n  \\nOnce you get to the island, their are many restaurants all along the beaches.  Competition from waiters to get you to sit at their tables from the various restaurants is fierce.  The staff will allow you to leave your bags and towels on tables with the hope that you will purchase food and drinks when finished snorkeling or swimming in the ocean.  We always just purchased drinks.  The most common snorkeling area is Coral Beach.  Recommend that you go early before larger numbers of persons start to arrive as the beaches can get a little crowded later in the day.   Snorkeling is ok at Coral Beach with descent number and variety of fish and a reef close to shore.

Find your way to the pier at Playa Linda . If staying at any of the hotels , a public transit bus costing 7-10 pesos from Ixtapa or 12 pesos from Zihuatanejo will drop you right in front of the pier. It is a 10 minute walk if staying at hotels around the Azul Grand. Of course , cabs are abundant and can drop you at the pier , and are waiting their in the evening . We chose to go early, 9 am ,  as the snorkelling is better at that time, because the water is not all churned up . The cost is 40 pesos each to take the boat over , don\\'t lose the ticket they give you for you return trip home. Snorkelling gear was available to rent on the island, just not sure what the cost was .\\n\\nOn the way over in the boat , we were befriended by one of the restaurant owners on the way over - Luili sp? , set us up on the snorkelling beach with chairs and umbrella , and then went to his place on the swimming beach for lunch. Quite the little business man and a wealth of knowledge about the area .\\n Bring water shoes for the snorkelling beach as it is killer on bare feet . When snorkelling try to stay away form the far left , and the tow will drag you in to a very shallow area with lots of coral... might get a bit cut up if your not paying attention. It was quite deserted for a hour or so, and that was good , had the beach and water to ourselves . More people started to arrive around 1045-11 am with snorkelling tours . Another reason to go early. \\n\\nWe headed over to the beach side to swim a bit more after we staked our spot to plant ourselves in the sand . We grabbed a bucket of beer , and chilled as we watched more folks come over and run the gauntlet down the beach to find a place to sit. I did not find any to be too aggressive as I had read earlier. Lunch options at this particular restaurant - Luili sp? which drew us there were freshly caught fish and shrimp . We enjoyed a seasoned red snapper , and have no idea what the seasoning was , other than it was red and tasted amazing , and the shrimp were done in a garlic butter and were oh so good .It also with salad and chips and salsa , far too much food, but we devoured all of it . He was a great host, and was not pushy at all . I would recommend his spot .\\n\\nThe last boat leaves at about 5 pm .\\n\\nWe enjoyed a hot sunny day on the island , hope you will too .", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "253234371": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Snorkeling fun", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is easy to get to if you just hop on the bus &amp; then get on the boat taxi!

We were 2 families with young children and the beach swimming for the younger ones is not an option in Troncones (quite often not for the adults either.) We had a car so it was a quick 20 minute drive from Troncones to Playa Linda and then a short water taxi ride over to the island. The kids spent all day in the water and loved every minute of it. The adults relaxed and had some great drinks served in full pineapples.\\nThe food was OK but the palapa restaurants on the island are somewhat expensive. They have you captive after all. It was very quiet when we were there on Dec. 16 and I can imagine that it can get very crowded. The only downside to the whole day was the number of locals trying to sell their goods. While I understand they need to make a living, it is very frustrating when you can\\'t hold a conversation with your friends because the lady selling sea shell necklaces won\\'t take no for an answer. I live in Mexico and am used to the artisans trying to sell me their goods, but I have never felt quite so harassed as this. Maybe it was worse for us because it was so quiet.\\nIf you go, do try to remember to ask your waiter about the deer on the island. My daughter and I stumbled upon them by accident on our last trip up the hill to the restroom before heading back to the mainland. They had been fed a huge pile of vegetables and tortillas, which I am guessing is a daily ritual and one could get quite close and take pictures.

We rented snorkel equipment and were taken out into the viewing area by our guide.  We clung on to ropes around a small  flotation platform. There were very big waves so the water was murky.  Our guide brought food for the fish.  We had fish all around us.  We could feel them as they rubbed by our arms in their swarming around the food.  It was fun to snorkel and great for my daughters who had not done snorkelling before.  However the view of fish, coral and underwater plants pales in comparison with snorkelling on the Great Barrier Reef or places in the Caribbean.  Perhaps there are times when there waves are less and the water is crystal clear and there is more to see.  After we swam around on one side of the island we walked a short distance across the sand to a calm bay.  Here there was a sandy bottom for the most part.  Our guide took us to one end of the beach where he picked up and showed us some sea urchins.  We returned here to snorkel and swim on our own after the guided tour ended.  I had an excellent grilled fish for lunch.  We watched schools of big fish swim right up the the waters edge on the swirling water side of the island.  We sat in the water and they swam around us.  We took the boat ride back to Linda Beach.  There is a crocodile preserve there.  We saw lots of crocodiles and iguanas.  This was a pleasant trip to a very relaxing getaway island.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "155508790": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nice for snorkeling.", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Good snorkeling on one side of the beach. other side nice sand good for laying out. we did a snorkeling tour so food was included. it was great food. but it was spendy if u wanted a drink.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "155445464": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Away from it all!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "A great place to spend a carefree day on the beach.

BUT the bus driver passed a watering truck on the right and squeezed by him by just a few inches and then our bus driver was pulled over by the police, which is NOT a good thing, especially when it adds at least 20 minutes to your bus ride.\\nAfter all that commotion and getting the bus restarted, we headed out again in the broiling heat.\\nWe got off the bus at Playa Linda and saw the crocodiles, lizards and iguanas all behind fences.  Then we walked down to the Pier and walked out to catch the little boats that go out to the island called Isla Ixtapa.  It cost 40 pesos for the round trip and of course, when you got to the island\\'s beach and were helped out of the boat, you were asked for a few pesos as a tip.  I did succumb the first time, but on the way back, I just ignored the request.  I had already paid for the ride and didn\\'t need that much help getting out of the boat.  REALLY ??\\nWe were told to go to the restaurant called Indio, which we did, after discovering the owner was sitting across from us in the little boat.  She showed us to her restaurant and we were there for the day.  I would suggest trying another place as all of the 7 or 8 places were very busy.  I was overcharged for my tiny glass of juice at 60 pesos.  It should have been 20 at the most. But the chicken fajitas were excellent.  So if you go to Indio\\'s don\\'t order a juice.  They were very nice people there and so any restaurant is fine.\\nThe swimming was fun and the water very refreshing. Wear water shoes though as there were large rocks and sharp shells to avoid.  Next to the Indio restaurant, they had all kinds of water toys for rent.  We saw jet skis, kayaks, etc.  and I would imagine they were all at reasonable rates.  \\nIf you wanted to snorkel, you could just walk up over and behind the restaurant to the other side of the island where there was another beach with huge coral reefs.  It was so shallow though that we did not venture out so as to not get cut up by the coral, which can be a nasty problem.\\nYou can rent snorkeling gear and go for it if you are so inclined.\\nI highly recommend this for a day trip, but try to go during the week, as weekends, when we went are extremely busy.

Took the bus from Ixtapa to Playa Linda, very easy 10 pesos. Walked down to the pier and paid 40 pesos each for a return ticket to the island. Took about 10 minutes to get there. Getting off the boat, was met by a man who took us to the snorkeling side and set us up at his restaurant table on the beach. Paid 20 pesos for Coronas, and 120 pesos for snorkel gear. It was a little old, but worked well. The deaf mute man I had heard about took us out through the coral. He had a boogie board with ropes attached, and went down and got a puffer fish that he brought up and let us handle. When we got back to shore, he wrote $5 in the sand, so we gave him 50 pesos. Not the easiest or best snorkeling spot, very murky and wavy water. Glad we did it though. Paid our bill and headed over to the swimming side, about a 2 minute walk between the 2 sides. The beach and water are amazing. Just laid there on a lounger getting Coronas brought to us, watched the fishermen bring in fresh fish to the restaurants. Headed back to the mainland, got off the pier and followed the fence up the canal where you can see the crocodiles and iguanas. Back to town again easily on the bus.

The beach is on a small crescent-shaped bay with fine yellow-white sand, clean clear cool Pacific Ocean water, and 4 or 5 beach-vendor &quot;haciendas&quot;. The best beach is on the north side of the island, so for most of the day the sun is to your back and left and the view over the water with the mainland in the backgroud is beautiful.  Consider this a day-trip, pack your beach bag, and travel north from Ixtapa about 5 miles to Playa Linda.  Take the Playa Linda bus, only 9 pesos.  From Playa Linda, buy a round-trip ticket on the &quot;water taxi&quot; and go to the &quot;second&quot; the beach.  I usually like either of the 2 vendors about half way down.  Full meal service, snacks, and cold beer at reasonable prices are available, along with all the special mixed drinks.

My party &amp; I took a taxi from hotel row in Ixtapa to Zihuatanejo pier.  It cost about $8. Then we hired a panga, or motorized row boat, to take us directly to this tiny beach called Isla Ixtapa.  There were hundreds of tourists in the front but a waiter directed us behind all the outdoor restaurants where it was quieter and breathtakingly beautiful.  We were led to a shaded table, on a white sandy beach, overlooking the most crystal clear calm turquoise water lagoon I had ever seen.  After drinking a Margarita, I walked to the water and dropped fish pellets in.  Suddenly my ankles were surrounded by huge groups of large fish fighting for food. What a hoot!  After lunch I hired a private snorkel guide &amp; swam out in 75 feet of water, with clear visibility, to see assorted colors and sizes of fish that made me giggle loudly and believe I was Jacque Cousteau filming a segment of National Geopgraphic.  Juan, my instructor, would dive down to the bottom of the sea and bring up puffer fish, sea urchins, and starfish for me to pet and touch.  I will never forget this experience especially since I can\\'t swim.  Bring an underwater camera if you go; bug spray for bees; walking shoes due to shells; and sunblock.  Lunch can be bought but avoid Lili Cipriani\\'s and manager Christian.  They will rob you without using a gun.  The cost of renting Snorkel equipment &amp; a guide is $15 pp.  You can even get an outdoor massage there or just swing in a hammock.

I took a trip before to Playa Manzanillo a few years ago in May but there were too many jelly fish to snorkel. I had been avoiding Isla Ixtapa in part because of negative reviews. So I cannot compare Playa Manzanillo and Los Gatos, but found the snorkelling to be amazing on Playa Coral, the exposed outer beach.\\n\\nI took a tour from Playa La Ropa with Ferdinand and was accompanied by Christian. We trolled for fish on the way but did not catch anything despite there being Bonitas jumping everywhere on the way there. Their boat was quite basic: just a panga with a canopy, but very seaworthy and Christian definitely knows the local waters. The view on the way with pounding surf on rocky outcrops and islands, studded with cactus and birds circling -- pelicans, vultures, frigate birds, gulls, terns -- was spectacular. The day with a guide was $90 USD for two. \\n\\nThe water at Playa Coral was crystal clear. Christian accompanied us snorkelling and would carefully point out smaller marine life that we might have missed. I saw more species than I had ever seen before because it was a coral reef with species that are more common or exclusively in that habitat. A few locals threw some tortillas in the water and a feeding frenzy of 12&quot; long fish ensued in a foot of water two feet from the beach. I saw lots of rainbow wrasses, sergeant majors, puffer fish, angel fish and other colourful fish I had know idea of the species.\\n\\nThe highlight was an Eagle Ray, 5\\' across hovering in crystal clear water 5 feet below me. I hovered above him while he slowly glided beneath me for two minutes. Unfortunately the battery on my waterproof camera had died (just $100 from Coppels in Zihuatanejo for a Kodak waterproof (to 3 meters: 10 feet) ).\\n\\nThe food at Indio\\'s was great: BBQ snapper and coconut shrimp for three with drinks for about 600 pesos: about $50.  You can find better prices at other places in the area, but sitting on a coral beach with incredibly fresh fish and shrimp, a margarita or two, what would you pay for that in North America! Muy gracias, signor! \\n\\nWe also stopped to snorkel at Las Elephante, a rocky island with a coral reef which was fun, but again not nearly as good snorkelling as Playa Coral. \\n\\nSo my advice is ignore the negative reviews, find a good captain, put on the snorkel and fins and be prepared for a great day. I remember one reviewer saying &quot;this is not the Caribbean&quot;. That is true: this is pacific Mexico, a whole different ecosystem, and the Caribbean is amazing, but this is still great.  Bring an underwater camera or get a disposable Kodak underwater camera and prepare to be amazed.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "120080649": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Waste of time", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "this is an overpriced place for what you get, we took the tour package and it was soooo not worth it.

We go primarily for the snorkeling at Playa Coral.  The fish are large and plentiful but you have to be there early (before 10 AM) while the water is still crystal clear.  By afternoon so many people have churned up the water that visibility is nearly zero.  There is also some good beachcombing - interesting driftwood and rocks - if you walk past the beach (to the right as you face the water on Playa Coral) around to the point.  We\\'ve always had good food there but it is a bit more expensive than one would pay at a beach restaurant on the mainland.  More annoying, we did have the experience that someone else mentioned in an earlier review - a 15% &quot;service fee&quot; was already added onto the bill but then the waiter claimed an additional 10 pesos above that.  It\\'s not the extra $1, but rather the negative feeling it left us with.  This may be a new \\'trick&quot; because it had never occurred on our previous visits and on this trip we encountered the same thing at 2 other beach restaurants in the Zihuatanejo area. \\n\\nIf you are a snorkeler, I\\'d recommend Isla Ixtapa as an early morning trip.

In the middle of the one swimming beach / snorkling beach there is a restaurant that serves both sides of the island. It must be shaped like a dumbell as the island narrowed at this site and a particular restaurant served both sides.  We started out early in the day on the snorkle side, and fed the fish, and then later moved over to the softer surf for the children to play in the water. (3 and 5 year old, surf on swim side was okay for them). The waiters assited us with moving all of our equipment, and even went so far as to move our chairs from under the palapas on the surf side over to the swim side.  Jessica speaks English and has no trouble assisting you with whatever you need for the day.

We love this little island, can not wait to visit once again.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "696773": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "WORST DAY of Vacation!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g153445-d152929-Reviews-Ixtapa_Island_Isla_Ixtapa-Ixtapa_Zihuatanejo_de_Azueta_Pacific_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The hotel was charging $35 to take you to the island; the street price was $25...but for 5 pesos (50 cents) for a bus to Playa Linda, and 30 pesos ($3) round trip you can get there easily.  The front beach is crowded and water is yucky...no snorkeling here.  Made the mistake of overpaying for snorkeling rental ($7 from the first guy I came to on the beach) BEFORE I checked out the coral beach.  As it turned out, I schlepped snorkeling gear a short walk through the jungle (pleasant trail) only to find out that the water was too rough to snorkel in.  If I went into the water past my knee someone came running from the huts to tell me not to get in the water.  Twice we were swamped by unexpected huge waves that engulfed us and left us with backpacks thoroughly soaked.  The public toilets are nasty and smell horrible.  The whole area is very rustic (but I didn\\'t mind that) but the guy who rented me snorkel equipment when he knew I couldn\\'t use it should be ashamed.  The crossing back over got hairy in 4-5 foot waves...I got a little nervous when they started passing float vests to everyone.  Got dumped into the water again when we landed.  Food and drink prices are horribly expensive.  To do it right again... I\\'d bring a cooler w/food &amp; drinks, my own snorkel gear (plus float vest).  Very pretty area...\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ixtapa Island (Isla Ixtapa)", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0b/76/96/snorkelers-at-playa-coral.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "Ixtapa", "addressRegion": "Pacific Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}}
