This site symbolically sums up the story of the conquest of the New World by the Spanish: the pre-columbine cultures were crushed under the European culture and their sacred (the pyramid) were buried under the European sacred (the church). Visiting this place will make you better understand the story of the conquest.\\n\\nThe pyramid is said to be the biggest monument on earth, twice as large as the pyramid of Cheops in Cairo, Egypt.  Actually, the Cholula pyramid is lower than the Cheops pyramid (66 metres, compared to about 140 metres), but it is much larger at the base (450 metres, compared to 230 metres), so that its total volume is much larger. The pyramid was built by the Toltecs in various successive steps, starting from the 3rd century: periodically, the size of the pyramid was increased by adding a new layer of stones to the previous one, and the last addition was presumably made in the 9th century. A tunnel excavated at the base of the pyramid allows the visitor to appreciate how the works progressed.  \\n\\nWhen the Spaniards arrived, they decided not to demolish this monument, but they partially covered it with a layer of earth; then they built a church on the top. Many trees grow on the pyramid, whose sides have a rather small slope; an easy staircase climbs to the top, and admission is free. The church has no special artistic merits, but the views from there are awesome: the view extends to the city of Puebla and to the mountains surrounding the Puebla plains; the frightful Popocatep\\u00e9tl volcano dominates the scene from above your head.\\n\\nThe site is in the Municipality of San Pedro Cholula (which is one of the three Municipalities composing the agglomeration of Cholula: the other two are San Andr\\u00e9s Cholula and Santa Isabel Cholula). Half an hour is sufficient for the visit, but you will probably like to stay more.

The (free) walk to the Church at the top of the great pyramid alone is outstanding, try to stay until the sun sets behind a stunning skyline of active volcano Popacatepetl and snow-topped Ixtaccihuatl.  There is a fee to enter the archaeological zone, which includes a separate walk through tunnels left from earlier excavations of the pyramid (NOT appropriate for claustrophobes!!!).  There is a remarkable plaza with altars, and signage in Spanish and English. But what I found most incredible were the many layers of construction exposed. The site could be confusing for visitors, which explains its mixed reviews here. So I have a strong recommendation: visit the Museo Regional de Cholula beforehand! It is a new museum, NOT the museum which is included in the ticket price and has some tired exhibits (Museum de Sitio de Cholula). In contrast, Museo Regional has stunning artifacts, excellent explanations of volcanoes, geography, and PreHispanic glyphs, and best of all it has videos and digital interpretation (in English and Spanish) which help the visitor understand the multi-layered Pyramid construction, and its importance in the story of Mexico. After seeing the Museum, we were eager to explore the Pyramid itself, and were able to appreciate its status as the largest pyramid in the world, in both its volume and the size of its base.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Great Pyramid of Cholula", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/24/62/2a/great-pyramid-of-cholula.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "", "addressLocality": "San Pedro Cholula", "addressRegion": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "651579203": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Must see if staying in the vicinity of Puebla", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g609126-d1432208-Reviews-Great_Pyramid_of_Cholula-San_Pedro_Cholula_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/24/62/2a/great-pyramid-of-cholula.jpg", "datePublished": "February 11, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "We took a taxi there and back from our hotel in the historic centre of puebla.

Easy to get to by car or there is a new option of taking the tourist train from the city centre of Puebla directly to the main area of Cholula, which I believe takes 40 minutes. This is such a stunning little village, which gives you the sense of how life really is in Mexico. The pyramid tour starts by going underground to give you a sense of how it was built and it then continues on to the outside grounds. The tour takes about 1 hour, it was free and we just gave a tip at the end, as we had a really great guide. We can also do the tour without a guide if you like. Fantastic to see the largest pyramid in the world and learn the history of the ancient city. Afterwards you can walk up the church which sits on top of the pyramid. This is also free, but it is very steep, so it\\'s worth bringing water. Also good to mention that most of this is in the open and if you go in the summer you will need sunblock and a hat.

The Great Pyramid (though resembling a tree covered miniature mountain) can be seen for quite some distance away, with the yellow church at the peak attracting most of your attention. We began our tour at the museum located at the base of the pyramid, which highlighted the history of the pyramid and the sad events that happened to the native Cholulans during the Spanish\\'s conquest of Mexico in the early 16th century. The original artifacts, models, and exhibits are truly unique, as national museums only briefly touch on Cholula as a whole - this museum is a fitting tribute to this town, so go! The museum is definitely a must-see, and not just because a tour of the tunnels and ruins of the pyramid is included in the price of admission. \\n\\nA museum tour guide gives you an incredible tour of the museum and then to the tunnels located underneath the Great Pyramid. I\\'m saddened to see recent reviews that claim that the tunnel is currently closed. This may simply be due to the fact that there are occasional structural dangers, and closing the tunnel is in the public\\'s best interest. However, if I remember correctly, there is a locked gate at the tunnel entrance that is only accessible by someone at the museum, thus, you need to pay the small admission price. In any case, the tunnels merely give you a broader scope of how deep underneath this &quot;mountain&quot; the original architects went. It\\'s amazing to see how sophisicated indigenous people were, especially when compared to the great European civilizations during the same time period. \\n\\nAt the tunnel\\'s exit, there is a pathway that eventually leads to a side of the pyramid that has many archaeological excavations. Before you get there, there are a few street vendors. Here is where I tried fried grasshopper for the first time, all for the sake of being Mr. Outgoing! I really liked the candy vendor, and the fact that the lady gave samples of nearly everything to our group of 10 before we decided which one to buy and share among ourselves. There is also a vendor that sells small art pieces, all of which make for great souvenirs for loved ones back home. \\n\\nTo get to the archaeological excavations, I believe there is a fence and entrance that only allows those with museum tickets to pass through. After passing through, you get the best view of the yellow church sitting atop the pyramid, as well as a grand scope of what the pyramid originally looked like before centuries of tree and shrub growth made this into a hidden gem. Many stone engravings and steps are exposed, with much of the area surrounding the flat base also being part of the original city built around the pyramid. This is definitely a time when you want a knowledgeable guide, so pay the small museum admission price and go with a guide! There are also several cactus types around, including those used for the pulque drink. Learning about this historic alcoholic beverage, and drinking it in a nearby store later that day, was a nice addition. Finally, there is a miniature pyramid you are able to climb a little farther down (which prepares you for climbing the grand daddy of them all, the Pyramid of the Sun and Moon at Teotihucuan).\\n\\nOn to climbing the pyramid and seeing that yellow church up close! Before getting to the cobblestone walkway that partly encircles the side of the pyramid, you pass several large vendors in a street market. If this is your first stop in Mexico, just know that you\\'ll see these same items over and over again. If you\\'re in a rush, or don\\'t know how to bargain and get stuck with a high price, just wait for the next market scene. Puebla has a beautiful market, especially on Sundays, when everything is closed for this family-orientated society. However, walking up the hill brings many more vendors, including many hats and food opportunities. I would try the street food every chance you get! (Though I\\'ve been advised not to try big meals via street vendors, though fruits and candies are an exception in my eyes). The hill isn\\'t too bad of a hike, and in no time, you are at a final flight of steps that lead you to that yellow church you\\'ve been seeing all day. At the top, the church is surrounded by a courtyard that allows you to look in all directions. There are several mountains on the horizon. Seeing the residential and commercial neighborhoods from this height is pretty cool too. Take a quick peak (or send a prayer) inside the church, as the art and architecture is nice (though there are dozens of similar-awesome churches in central Mexico). \\n\\nThis entire attraction should be at least a half-day visit, followed by walking the market and store scene in downtown Cholula. Having lunch by the main park, drinking pulque, and relaxing in a historic colonial town in Mexico isn\\'t a bad way to spend an afternoon.

It was really disappointing and nothing worth seeing really. Signs in English and Spanish tell you what the pile of rock used to be and how they were decorated but they could say anything. It\\'s maybe a 15 min stroll if you walk very slowly. The only thing I thought would make the site worthwhile were the tunnels in to the Pyramid but after walking around trying to find the entry to them learnt they were closed. The included museum is very basic with 2 rooms. The only good thing way the model.  Would recommend the church and walk around outside.

Basically you have a community living around a pyramid that was then taken by the Spanish , they killed all and sundry, as locals kept coming to the site, the spanish decided to put a church on top so they could convert them instead. Over time the pyramid has become overgrown to the extent it is not recognisable. However when it was excavated it is one of the biggest pyramids in the world! There is a small and dull museum to one side , then you can walk through some of the tunnels inside the pyramid before scaling it up to the church on top. The views are incredible covering Puebla in one direction and Popocatepetl in the other, as well as Cholula itself.\\nThe church itself is quite small inside.\\nWe also went to the  San Gabriel convent and zocolo opposite which was very picturesque.

Use a tour bus, do a cursory tour on your own without a guide, or spend $20 or so and get a 50 minute explanation, with all your questions answered.

We travelled early in the morning to avoid the heat of the day. \\n\\nWhen we arrived our first action was to climb to the top of the hill and see the church which is built over the pyramid, which largely remains uncovered. The hill is extremely steep and not for the feint hearted and it was a popular spot for joggers and dog walkers. \\n\\nThe 360 view from the top is quite spectacular, though when I visited the view to the volcano was quite obscured due to the smoke and haze. It is an active volcano. The church itself in comparison to others visited, was quite modest, we did not linger as many were in prayer.\\n\\nWe then descended and made our way to the entrance of the pyramid. The entrance fee was 46 Pesos and this covered entrance into the pyramid tunnels which is within the hill and the surrounding grounds which has various excavation sites and lastly the museum. \\n\\nWhen we entered the tunnels we were in front of a group of local school children, so we felt quite hurried going through the maze of tunnels, though admittedly there is nothing to really see or read in there. For those who suffer claustrophobia, it may be a harrowing experience. I have to admit being \\'pursued\\' by a group of excited children in such surroundings made me feel a little like Indiana Jones being chased by a large boulder! \\n\\nUpon exiting the tunnel, the teachers of the school group commenced a lesson, obviously about the site and unfortunately our Spanish was not sufficient to benefit from lingering to listen. \\n\\nWe continued around the site, which is sprawled across large grounds. Although there is much to see in terms of excavations, there is actually little information available. There are stone tablets with both Spanish and English descriptions, however some were a little hard to read and it would have benefited with more information at times. \\n\\nAt the end of this section, there is a large exposed section of the pyramid, which you can climb. The pyramid is expansive, which is evident by the size of the grounds and is reported to be the largest archaeological site of a pyramid in the new world.\\n\\nAfter we exited this attraction, we tried to locate another site, however we couldn\\'t locate it. It was a building made of sacrificed children\\'s skulls. We then visited the museum, which was quite small but had a great 3D map of the pyramid and surrounds and gave us a great aerial perspective of what we had just visited. The museum also has a replica chamber of what was unearthed by archeologists when they were excavating the pyramid. The colours are quite vivid.\\n\\nWe took half a day to visit this attraction and recommend starting in the morning. It was quite interesting but when compared to others I subsequently visited on my trip through Mexico and Central America, I would suggest you find a local guide to obtain the best experience.

There are many drawings and an amphitheater type area. The walk to the top is exhausting, but the views are beautiful. You can see so many of the churches that still remain in Cholula and all the brightly colored buildings. The church at the top is beautiful and I didn\\'t realize that if you walk all the way to the front, there is a little tour of the back area with beautiful carvings and pictures as well.
