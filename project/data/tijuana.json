Non-pushy vendors on the beach and boardwalk with their offerings of skewers of grilled shrimp or superb helados and so much more. Dozens of seafood cafes, with balconies and decks overlooking the beach. Amazing quality. I arrived as they prepared for Spring Break and the start of the beach season. Life guard stands were opened, cleaned and painted.. Walls and stairs were cleaned and painted . . The entire place came alive. Speeches given. People cheered. Lifesaving demonstrations were given. Happy . . All was good . . \\n\\nThis is the only place I\\'ve ever seen with more music than the cantina at Tlaquepaque (Guadalajara). Actually, most of it was awful and making up in quantity what they lacked in quality. But, starting in the morning, you\\'ll see tuba, guitars, drums . . and more. When was the last tme you saw a band like that walking along the surf, looking for a place to start? Some of the bands, though, were truly good. Most importantly, though, was the sheer joy of it all . . , even with the occasional &quot;blaats&quot;. LOL\\n\\nMy regret?

We don\\u2019t go to the beach (it\\u2019s cold and its full of people) it isn\\u2019t a beautiful beach to gather around. Lot of noise. But if you would like to go I recommend to park in La Monumental (bull fight ring). The view in the afternoon is beautiful and you can take lots of pictures there with the light house and all the hearts (art) that are there in the pier. Yoa can eat sea food, coconut with shrimp (I recommend the ones near the light house). You can also buy corn tamales there in the ave pacifico street. And drink some aguas frescas at la Muchoaca at the corner in front of the arches. In Playas there are lots of coffee shops. We like to enjoy the B coffee my teen daughter likes it and my baby can walk around. We fill safe because there is only one door. We also love the birria Javier near ave Playas and La perla. Were the big big Oxxo is. The meat is clean ad my baby can eat. My teen loves the quesadillas. For 3.80 dlls you can get a huge quesadilla with meat. The service is excellent. At the ave Ensenada just in front of the Catholic Church there are \\u201cMariscos Ensenada\\u201d where you are going to eat the best chilli shrimp tacos. They have a variety of sea food to select . The service is excellent and don\\u2019t forget to ask for \\u201cagua the orchata\\u201d from the tortas. In that same corner you can eat meat tortas at the Washmobile place. They are great. For dessert there are the \\u201cnieves de garrafa\\u201d near the baseball fields. Near ave Playas. They are delicious and they have a lot of different flavors. If you are looking to sit at a restaurant and it a big breakfast american-mexican Style and not to expensive. I recommend \\u201cCasa Don Juan\\u201d or \\u201c Layhoos Caf\\u00e9\\u201d at ave Pedregal. If you would like to visit a place rather than the beach you can go to \\u201cCasa de la Cultura\\u201d  at Ave Agua and paseo Pedregal. There are some expos and big murals outside. You can take good pictures. Expect delay when going in and out of Playas some weekends some time there are concerts and a lot of people attend them. For hotel I recommend the one that is entering Playas just at your right. Has parking and pool. Hacienda del Mar I think is called.  Well that is is.

It\\'s a start contrast to the homeless situation at many San Diego beaches.

It\\'s hundreds of dollars less than my crappy old apartment in El Cajon.\\n\\nI\\'m actually wondering if people are making up bad things to say about Playas because they don\\'t want more tourists to come here raising prices.

I grew up and got married here.  It\\'s basically a suburb that happens to be the Northwest corner of Mexico.  Pacific ocean to the West, US (San Diego) to the North, mountains to the East, and more beach to the South. Find a place to seat alongside the boardwalk and watch dolphins, seals, cruiseships go by, and if it\\'s the right time of year, you may even see a whale or two go by.\\nEverytime I go visit, I am always so glad to be in Playas, it is quiet, peaceful and just nice!  Oddly enough, most of us who grew up there, rarely ever actually go IN the water (unless you like surfing, etc.) Most people on the beach are probably not Playas residents. We do enjoy walking on the boardwalk, coffee, a coconut or cool drink off many of the locally owned coffee shops and snack bars.  \\nNowadays, Playas has a mall, movie theater, many restaurants both locally owned as well as chain American restaurants.  It\\'s a suburb so don\\'t expect the ruckus you\\'d expect in the more tourist areas, don\\'t expect endless bars or people trying to sell you blankets, piggy banks and other crap you see alongside the border or downtown areas.  This is a residential area, with good schools, working middle and upper middle class neighborhoods. My family has been living there for generations. It\\'s grown a LOT in the last 15 years or so, but it still has a lot of charm I often took for granted when I lived there.  Whenever we\\'re in town, my kids (who don\\'t live here) are always in awe of just about everything, from the fantastic weather almost year round, the quiet living, helping my mom in the garden and gathering fruit from the trees to make fresh lemonade or baking a cake or pie.\\nEnjoy healthy dining at the Yogurt Place (b-fast, lunch and dinner), stop for hand-crafted coffee at Cafe Latitud 32 (you would need to go down to the boardwalk to find it), if you lucky  you can see a live band playing. A MUST is tacos from EL FRANCES... opened at night, they use the best cuts of meats, fresh home made tortillas and all the delicious fix-ins.

As a matter of fact, I saw the concrete and steel partition separating the Tijuana beach from Imperial beach quite easily when I first visited Playas.  \\n\\nThe ocean was just as blue as it is in Imperial Beach, and the waves lapped on the shores in a soothing, repetitive rhythm.  When I went, there was a festival at the beach.  A stage was set up right in the middle of it, a steel skeletal structure complete with giant speakers and stage lights.  Local Mexican music was playing loudly in the background, and the beach goers, clad with thongs, bikinis, sunglasses and hats, swayed to the music, laughing and sipping Tecate.  Children were hurling themselves gleefully onto the crashing blue water, seemingly oblivious to the occasional wave that loomed over the surface.  \\n\\nNext to the beach up the sloping rise are homes, shops and apartments lined up alongside the beach.  They were not as shiny and new as the ones in Imperial Beach; the buildings had a age worn look about them.  But there were flowers and plants everywhere, and Spanish architecture was all over the place.  It was definitely Mexico.\\n\\nWhen I climbed up one of the steep concrete stairways leading to the main street, I saw rows and rows of coconut vendors.  Patient Mexican men and women in the various booths had piles of fresh green coconut behind them.  I ordered one, and the nice gentleman who served me cut the top of one of the coconuts with his sharp machete, exposing the white tender meat without opening it.  He scooped the coconut meat loose and kept it inside the husk.  He mixed the meat with chile powder, Tejuina, limon and salt.  It was delicious.  I ate my coconut treat slowly as I surveyed the Tijuana beach street.\\n\\nThere were many Americans there, and they all seemed content to savor the atmosphere and occasionally talked to other Americans.  Mainly they sat on the many shop tables located outside, eyes half closed.  It was warm and the breeze was cooling and pleasant.  I didn\\'t feel inclined to talk either, just experience the scene.\\n\\nI can only describe Mexico as relaxed and friendly.  Nobody seemed to be in a hurry.  Even the local vendors seemed indifferent to the many hours they endured sitting in their booths, waiting for customers.  They occupied their time watching over their many children, who they carried around proudly in their arms or playfully chide when they got out of hand.  The local people laughed, played and loved each other.  \\n\\nPeople were more inclined to speak Spanish even though many could speak English.  I talked to a local American woman who just moved there.  She was able to live comfortably in a rented one bedroom apartment close to the beach with her modest retirement income.  She could even get phone signal from the U.S. where she lived.  When I asked her if she missed the U.S., she said, &quot;I visit there, but my life is much better here.&quot;  I believe her.\\n\\nI consider Playas de Tijuana as an affordable paradise, not a posh retreat.  It\\'s a nice place to sip, consider and just be.  I\\'ve been in more affluent beach communities, but in my humble opinion, it might as well be. The beauty is in the people, the atmosphere and the lifestyle.  The only thing I will say is...you have to be there to feel it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playas de Tijuana", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/68/66/d5/south-end-facing-north.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo Ensenada porque me sur # 1023 frente la Iglesias esteia del mar plays Tijuna", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "256229269": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Nice area away from the beaten path", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d2236731-Reviews-Playas_de_Tijuana-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/68/66/d5/south-end-facing-north.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The beach in Tijuana is not crowded, even on US holidays, and has several places to take coffee, especially LAT32, while watching the ocean.

Still there was loud music and people having drinnks on the beach.

This is not really a tourist area, although visitors are definitely welcome!  Most Americans gravitate towards the downtown area of TJ (Ave. Revolution) or Rosarito, although there are nice eating establishments on the bluff overlooking the beach.  The majority of of people you will meet in this area are local residents, and the restaurants and shops cater to residents. Therefore, restaurants do not generally offer cheap lobster dinners but do have a nice modestly priced dinners and appetizers that cater to local tastes.  Shrimp cocktails, fish tacos, and various seafood concoctions are the local fare, with local Nortena bands for entertainment and buckets of cervesas the primary draw.  The beach is nice, but is very crowded with locals on most days. This is a place to visit only if you are interested in experiencing the locals scene.  Every restaurant has at least one English-speaking waiter, but remember tourists as primarily a secondary market here.  It is safe, fun, and a good place to go if you are interested in a more &quot;locals&quot; scene.  The beach boardwalk is a nice addition, and the food/drink prices are better than what will be found in the downtown area.

It is even more of an attraction if you are interested in border issues and in seeing where the border fence separating Mexico and the US goes into the Pacific Ocean. As of 2011 the city of TJ has put in an attractive observation deck , with public pay restrooms right next to the border and friendship park which when/if it reopens will allow persons on either side of the border to interact with persons on the other side. .The city has also built an attractive entryway with arches at the main entrance to the beach about 1 block south from the observation deck. From the arch there is an amphitheater with stone steps leading down to the water, a two way raised wooden boardwalk that goes for at least a kilometer, and lifeguard towers. If you go on a warm summer day especially on a Sunday you will see many families from Tijuana and surrounding areas enjoying the wide sandy beach. If you walk down the boardwalk you ca see some public art on the walls of buildings, stop at one of sever small coffee shops, or just take in the scenery. There are also modest restaurants mostly serving seafood above the boardwalk. If you like ice cream a store across the street  from the arches provides a good selection of the Mexican ice cream bars called paletas along with drinks and snacks. The big stadium structure you see is the Bullring By the Sea (Plaza Monumental is official name) which has bullfights during the summer and has hosted many concert by groups such as Pitbull, Mana, and Santana. Even though the beach is located right on the border it has a  feel of  being more authentic \\u201cMexican\\u201d and not catering to nearly as much to foreign tourists as the Tijuana\\u2019s Revolution Ave and Rosarito Beach about 20 minutes south..  In general from the perspective of many tourists the area is underdeveloped and there are some old or unfinished buildings that seem out of place especially when they have great views and are right by the water.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Playas de Tijuana", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/68/66/d5/south-end-facing-north.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Paseo Ensenada porque me sur # 1023 frente la Iglesias esteia del mar plays Tijuna", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Plaza_Rio_Tijuana-Tijuana_Baja_California": {"639047586": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "great place for a relaxing afternoon shopping and enjoying the foods", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d8425027-Reviews-Plaza_Rio_Tijuana-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0f/a8/a3/f8/teatro-al-aire-libre.jpg", "datePublished": "December 11, 2018", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "When in Tijuana, do stop by this fairly good sized indoor/outdoor mall with all the services.

We were especially lucky because there was some sort of festival going on outside the museum as well as all of the great exhibits around inside. \\nI\\'m not art buff but it was interesting to see the paintings, sculptures and such on one level but our favorite exhibit was the Mayan exh. in the Botanical Gardens. Such a beautiful walk! The history is rich and detailed and we loved learning so much about Tijuana\\'s/Mexico\\'s  beginnings. There was an Asian exhibit as well. Unfortunately, most of the descriptions are in Spanish with no translation so unless you have a basic understanding of Spanish, you\\'ll find it hard to read/learn. But it\\'s still nice walking through it. We understood a good deal of it so we were fortunate. \\nThe aquarium is very small and dingy/dark compared to US aquariums but it was pretty and had some nice components.

There are plenty of references to sexual organs and symbols in the art but there are some historically-themed paintings. The concrete building has large open empty expanses with wide open spaces. That puzzled us as there is plenty of room to place exhibits but none were there. There was one upstairs area where people were looking at exhibits, but the stairs were roped off with a guard standing by. He pointed us to an information desk where we were told we couldn\\'t go up to that level. At least that\\'s what we thought they told us since we don\\'t speak Spanish.

I have never had any bad experience at this place until a few days ago. At 66 years of age and having a difficulty to walk due to back surgery, I was inside the sportsbook on Oct. 10th 2018. My friends at the table, recommended me to join the Caliente online Sportsbook, instead of walking back and forth to the betting counter. I did that and I was asked to make a deposit at any Caliente sportsbook. I went to the betting counter and met the female Manager who checked my driver\\'s license as ID and assisted me to make a deposit of $400 in pesos which amounted to 7160 pesos. I sat at my table and enjoyed the games, while I placed some bets. I won some and lost some. Three days later October 13, 2019, I went back and placed some more bets. I also asked for 6000 pesos withdrawal from my balance. The Supervisor Juan at that time said I cannot get any money, until I go online and make a request. It takes 4 days for approval and they will send me a code. While at the sportsbook, I went online and filled the request. 4 days later I got an email with a code saying it has been approved. I went back to the same Caliente sportsbook at Casino Caliente on Oct. 16th. The Manager at that time Hector Rendon figured the amount to US $335.19. Then Hector asked me for my ID. I provided it as requested. First Hector said my approval is pending. Then I gave him the code I received. Hector said that he cannot pay me as they have no connection with Caliente Sportsbook. I asked for his Manager and then the Caliente Manager Oswaldo De La Cruz came and said the same thing. I asked Manager Oswaldo, if you took my deposit for $400 (7160 pesos) at this sportsbook, how can you not give me 6000 pesos? I was told to go online and make my request by calling them at 664-454-3333. I politely asked him to call and assist me. Oswaldo refused to help me and said it was my problem. He even refused to let me use the casino phone to make that call. \\nI called using my cell phone and spoke to Alejandro right away. First Alejandro tried to deny that I made any deposit, then I reminded him, I am currently still making bets on that account and I will go to the police station (the Commandancia) and make a complaint. He then said, that is not necessary and I will get paid, but I have to upload my ID documents online (including proof of the receipt that I had made a deposit of 7160 pesos) and then I can withdraw from my account. I asked my wife to talk to him and he told her the same thing. I uploaded all the documents as requested. It has been 2 days and I have not received or heard from them yet.

This is a pretty small casino with a handful of tables and quite a bit of machines for people that like to play slots. I usually like to play at the tables so I checked out the tables. \\n\\nThere is one roulette table, one crap table, one three card poker table, one blackjack table and one texas hold \\'em poker table where you play against the house and not against each other. They also have a separate area where one is able to bet on american sports such as football and basketball as well as horse racing. The tables at this location is cheaper to play then lets say Vegas. The minimum bet is 30 pesos which comes out to be less than $2 a hand with the exchange rate. The sports betting for some reason takes place in American Dollars even if you bet money in pesos. Of the four bets i placed on the NFL playoffs I only won one and even though I placed the bet in pesos they gave me back my measly winnings in dollars. I only bet about $12 or 200 pesos on the game so not that I was a big gambler. \\n\\nHere, another thing unlike a casino in Vegas, you pay the money at the cage for however you want to start off with and they give you a receipt showing thats how much you paid in at the cage. Then you take that receipt and present it at the table and they will give you the equivalent amount in chips. Make sure to hang on to the receipt because you need the receipt to cash back your winnings otherwise they charge a 5% fee. I had fun when I played. \\n\\nThis place might also not have all the tables staffed at all times. I went in on a Sunday afternoon and I wanted to play Texas Hold\\'em and they told me that they didn\\'t have enough dealers to have that table open.

Very few Americans were around to take in this cultural event. Some people want to do away with these events but I appreciate the historical and cultural aspect of it. Who knows someday these events will end in Mexico so I can say I was there. There were a total of three bullfighters and they each fought two bulls. Depending on the skills as judged by the audience, by show of waving white handkerchiefs, the bullfighter either is handed no ears, one ear or two ears from the bull after it has been put down.\\nObviously animal lovers will hate this sport, but as I said who I am to judge.. The bullring is located in a section of Tijuana called Playas De Tijuana and is located very close to the ocean and not very far from the border fence. We were in Rosarito so we took the public taxi van from there to downtown then transferred to another van than took us right to the bull ring. Each ride cost 18 pesos which is about $1.10 at todays exchange rate. They sell tacos and stuff outside the bullring at great prices just outside the ring but inside the gate. The vendors also walk around inside selling snacks, cokes, beer, souveniers  and cigars. I bought a Maria and Lenin cigar made in Mexico that I really enjoyed. The beers cost $30 pesos which is a couple of U.S. dollars. \\nThere is huge parking lot and they charge $60 pesos or about $4 U.S. to park.\\nIf you dont feel comfortable driving here from the U.S., although I do as I have a weekend home in Rosarito, you can walk across the border and jump on the public bus to centro, or downtown, then transfer to public bus going to Playsa.\\nThere is another bullfight coming up on November 21, 2015 but unfortunately I can\\'t make it.\\nI loved everything about it including the music etc.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Monumental Plaza de Toros", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/65/25/5a/photo0jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Del Pacifico 4", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "22240", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Parque_Park_Morelos-Tijuana_Baja_California": {"473697383": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Charming and diverse park", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d10088930-Reviews-Parque_Park_Morelos-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/db/82/f1/zootj.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The small zoo features a white tiger, cute monkeys, and some beautiful birds.

Unfortunately this also the park\\u2019s biggest downfall.\\nThere is no shortage of fun things to do here, but the level of safety level of this park is questionable at best.   One immediately noticeable element is the fact that open alcohol consumption is allowed throughout the park.  There is certainly no crime in having a beer or two, but especially combined with the less than stellar condition and design of some of the attractions, allowing intoxicated people to roam freely throughout the park and rides is not exactly a great idea.\\nOne of the first things we watched after when arriving at the park and getting settled is this rolling log type thing that is suspended above the water with steps to climb up to it on each end.  I thought it looked pretty cool and as a bit of a fitness junkie wanted to try my luck at balancing on it.  But, directly in front of this structure is a sign instructing patrons in all caps not to walk on the log (you\\u2019re supposed to bear hug it and inch across). Several people walked on it anyway while the lifeguard watched people fall as if he were entertained by their efforts.   The kicker is that the pool below is only 2-3 feet deep, at most.  So if you fall (which everyone does) you\\u2019d better hope you don\\u2019t hit the water wrong and head straight to the bottom.  Easy way to get hurt.\\nRegarding water slides, part of the fun for me on enclosed water slides is the visual of flying through the tunnel \\u2013 so cool.  But then there are the slides at El Vergel - these things are straight evil.  The corkscrew twists and turns look innocent and fun enough from the outside \\u2013 until you are actually inside them.  For once you slide down the opening of the slides at El Vergel you are greeted with the wonderful surprise that they are pitch black inside  Like can\\u2019t see your hand in front of your face pitch black. Like can\\u2019t see and prepare your body for that sharp 90 degree downhill turn your body is about to be whipped through at ludicrous speed.  I could honestly maybe see how one could think this may sound fun on paper but you will have bruises and be dizzy when you come out, just as everyone in our group experienced.\\nThe infrastructure is also just kinda dicey. You pull up to this place in the seemingly the middle of nowhere and are greeted by the homemade looking sign that is pinned into the mountain side and appears to have been cut out of recycled tin roof pieces.  In the park you climb shaky, sometimes rusty steps on your way up to the top of slides, you can see slides shake as people go through them, and one slide had some kind of thin cable tied between the supporting beams that had the look of a temporary repair.   There is one open slide on which the rider actually catches a bit of air \\u2013 just a few feet directly above the catch air section is a length of enclosed pipe from another slide that twists around it.  We didn\\'t\\u2019 see it happen, but It did not appear a terribly unlikely event that someone could bump their head on the pipe above if they were tall enough.\\nIt\\u2019s a fun day trip and something a little bit different to do but be careful , mindful of, and responsible for your own safety!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Albercas El Vergel", "image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/branding/rebrand/TA_brand_logo.png", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Calle Tijuana Mexico 22110", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "22110", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Museo_del_Trompo-Tijuana_Baja_California": {"676611035": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Play with science", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d4697903-Reviews-Museo_del_Trompo-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/9f/e2/fe/20160430-141257-largejpg.jpg", "datePublished": "May 26, 2019", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This is an exciting place to bring children, there are a lot of activities.

There were 3 places we wanted to visit, CECUT, Mini City, and El Topo.  We\\'ve been to Kidzania in Korea so we were happy to find something similar in driving distance away.  We arrived at Plaza Rio little past 11am on Saturday and found a lot of parking.  None of the staff spoke English and the way they spoke real fast seems like there aren\\'t that many non-Spanish speakers that visit here.  With Google Translate App and my forgotten 2 year of high school Spanish, I communicated the price, that we need to purchase their socks with sticky bottom for trampoline, and write kids name and my name for them to input into the watch which doubles for kids bank account.  So as others has stated, like Kidzania, there are 2 types of experience that kids can do.  First is work type where they earn money: fire fighter, doctor, supermarket cashier, farmer who milks and sells the milk, reporter, TV anchor, Radio DJ, etc.  Each time you complete a task they scan the watch kids wear to pay them salary.  With money earned, kids can do the second type of experience: driving a car, slide, zip line, trampoline, etc.  Although time we went, I don\\'t think they were deducting money for zip line and trampoline.  \\nSo they inputted kids name and took pictures of them for their watch bank account.  We went in and there weren\\'t that many people.  I think it had something to do with citizens of Mexico working the longest hours in the world which include working Saturdays.  It started to get packed around 3pm.  We decided to do the work type first to get money.  First one that we saw was newspaper reporter.  We spoke no Spanish so we used translator to answer some question that were given at the location.  But later I saw that they actually went around asking question at different work stations to do reporting.  Kids did the dairy farmer next where they fed the cow, milked the cow and went around to cooking school and market to sell the milk.  Next was market where they asked whether a kid wants to work or be a customer.  Luckily there was another parent who spoke English who told us when we stood there baffled at what the staff was asking.  Next was firefighter where kids get to ride on a fire engine and put out a fire on a building.  The building didn\\'t have any drawing of fire so I think my kids were confused.  Later I saw that there were bit more explanation for kids who spoke Spanish, including going down the fire pole.  Kids took a break from all the Spanish and decided to go on the trampoline.  My older one decided to make a pizza, which cost about $4-5 for a personal pepperoni or cheese pizza.  Staff dressed them up with an apron and a chef\\'s hat while he made a pizza.  My younger one played on a climbing structure while my older one did the driving experience.  In driving experience, you can be a driver, car washer, or gas station attendant.  Rest of the day was just playing.  My son went on the zip line twice.  Went down the long slide by the entrance numerous times, went back to trampoline, and made slime in the slime lab which cost about 100 peso ($5).  By this time, it was getting pretty crowded.  We left around 4pm.  There were a lot of birthday parties and kids by this time.  \\n\\nGoogle Translator App came in very handy.  I found out that there is no in and out privilege.  Once you leave, that\\'s a final exit, which is a shame since there were a lot of nice restaurants in the Plaza.  Then again, it only cost about $10 per kids and cheaper for adults.  We had breakfast, fed kids pizza that they made and juice.  There were snacks and coffees available in Mini City.  Kids wanted to stay longer to play but we a long drive back to LA. \\n\\nIt was fun but in comparison to Kidzania in Seoul, it was bit lacking.  For example not all stations showed how long the experience is, how much money they\\'ll earn and so forth.  Fire experience in Kidzania actually had water gun like in carnival games to shoot fire with picture of fire.  Little things to make experience better, but then again it cost much more at Kidzania.  \\n\\nWe will be learning Spanish as a family an will return.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Mini City", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/14/7e/0b/20/photo2jpg.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Blvd. Paseo de Los Heroes #95, Local C4, Plaza Rio", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "22010", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}, "Estadio_Gasmart-Tijuana_Baja_California": {"569873974": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Great time at the ballpark", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d10344211-Reviews-Estadio_Gasmart-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/63/07/5b/northern-division-game.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This was our first time going to see the Toros play at Estadio gasmart.

What makes the experience here different is that the star attraction for the fans is not what happens during the game, but rather what happens in the stands and ends up on the video scoreboard. There is lots of music, dancing, cavorting with the 4 mascots that roam about, and watching the cheerleaders that are dressed in (depending on your point of view) very attractive, or rather suggestive attire. The music is loud, and stops only when the pitcher is ready to throw the ball and caught by the catcher, or until the end of the play. There are a series of video cameras that are constantly looking for fans who are overtly looking for attention and willing to have some fun poked at them. Most people are watching the video scoreboard and not really paying attention to the game, and it would be annoying to come wanting to focus on baseball with all of the other stuff going on; the scoreboard is used to show player stats, commercials, and fan/mascot antics but only minimally for instant replay. But personally, I had a great time and would definitely come again. \\n\\nThe other thing to mention is the food court, which is like going to the county fair with a surprising array of choices. Besides typical staples of hot dogs and peanuts, there are a few taco vendors, hamburgers, carnitas, Buffalo wings, BBQ ribs, Thrifty ice cream, sushi, and all other typical Mexican fare. All the vendors have helpers roaming the stands with a menu: just flag down the one you are interested in &amp; they will bring you whatever you want. Beer is very inexpensive compared with the usual US prices (60 pesos, or about $3 for 24 oz. cup) and is also sold in the stands.  One can have a great time with very little money needed for parking, tickets, and food/drink. And, lots of bathrooms that are clean and not too crowded.\\n\\nEverything is in Spanish but the language is really not too much of an issue; most of the workers have at least a minimal understanding of English and for those that do not, there is always someone nearby to translate. All the announcements and such are in Spanish, but the entertainment value comes from the visuals, which really transcend language anyway.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Estadio Gasmart", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/63/07/5b/northern-division-game.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Mission de Santo Tomas s/n,Capistrano 22223", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "22440", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "444542688": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Average Venue for Concerts", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d10344211-Reviews-Estadio_Gasmart-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/63/07/5b/northern-division-game.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "This stadium is a Baseball stadium.

This year, she took me and another friend on the train from TJ to Tecate.  We had a great time! Be warned that if you take this train make sure that you are at the train at the time listed on your ticket as this train sticks to the established schedule and waits for no one! Right now, the train runs once a month. We went on a Saturday, so I imagine they only run Saturdays at the moment.  Apparently, the train had not run for 4 years while they repaired the train tracks.  You can purchase burritos on the train, but chose to wait until we got to Tecate to eat.  Given that we didn\\'t purchase food, we were told that we would be given free samples of their cheeses and a tiny cup of Sangria which they refilled.  They had raffles and played games for prizes on the way to Tecate.  The prizes were tickets to various tours in Tecate such as the Tecate Brewery, the Kumiyaii Museum, and their new Cultural Center.  We won the tickets to the brewery!  On the way back, we had Mariachi music (7-piece group), and free samples of Tequila they were selling on board. I took a tiny taste of two different kinds of Tequila and decided that was enough for me!  As far as food is concerned, it is recommended that you not eat downtown as the train assistants are worried that it may take too long and you will miss your train back.  They do have several food trucks at the train station which sell Mexican food, water, and beer.  I was worried about Turista, so I went with a bottle of beer!  When on the train, you will pass through two very dark tunnels which everyone seemed to love and cameras were snapping pics like crazy! The train also makes a 5-minute stop so you can take your pic in front of the dam.  The train assistants were friendly and helpful, though they spoke very little English--still, we managed! The train left at 9 AM pronto and we arrived back in TJ at approximately 6:30PM. The train ride itself was approx. 2 1/2 hrs.

Stay south of the Tijuana arch unless you want to see more shady things like prostitution, brothels, and drug dealers. If you do go to the &quot;dark side&quot; for a peak, stay on the main drag as the side alleys and back streets are reportedly not safe for anyone, especially tourists to visit. Avenida Revolucion feels safe, particularly with armed local and federal police patrolling every 5-10 minutes. If you need a place to relax, there are a few classy air conditioned coffee shops on the street. If you are looking for a special souvenir, I suggest looking for a hand made mortar and pestle carved from porous volcanic rock (called a molcajete). Make sure to check it carefully though as some are fake and made from cement in mold. They are a different color and have mold lines and smoother surface.

This may change once the construction is completed.\\n\\nAround noon time, it took less than 10 minutes for the Mexican visa application for the both of us as there were very few people in front of us.  There is no charge for the visa application.  \\n\\nAfter exiting the building follow the signage to get to Revolution Avenue.  It will be about a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) walk to the Tijuana Arch landmark and Avenida Revoluci\\u00f3n.  If you get lost, use this landmark to get your bearings.  Heading back to the US, retrace your steps to get back to the highway and then walk along the highway path to get to the USA immigration building.  On the way back we waited about 20 minutes to get back to San Ysidro.\\n\\nAvenida Revoluci\\u00f3n is maybe a 6 \\u2013 7 block stretch where the \\u201caction\\u201d is.  If you\\u2019ve been to Playa del Carmen, it is somewhat similar in some respects \\u2013 lots of souvenir stores and restaurants.  On the Avenida Revoluci\\u00f3n there are also a few pharmacies selling cheap drugs.\\n\\nWe were there for about 4 hours to browse and have lunch.  We did buy 4 mini-guitars after some \\u201cserious\\u201d negotiations.\\n\\nIf you like souvenir shopping, this maybe the place for you.\\nFor me it\\u2019s not the shopping but the browsing, eating and soaking in the culture.  I would rate the experience at 3.25 out of 5 rating \\u2013 above average.\\n\\nNotes &amp; Tips\\n    \\u2022 The restaurant that is said to have invented the Caesar Salad is on Avenida Revoluci\\u00f3n\\n    \\u2022 Check out the \\u201czebras\\u201d on Avenida Revoluci\\u00f3n and take a photo with one for a fee\\n    \\u2022 We had lunch at El Gallo (in Tijuana), at the Santiago Arguello outdoor mall across from  the McDonald\\'s.  Santiago Arguello \\u201cruns\\u201d right into Avenida Revoluci\\u00f3n by the Tijuana Arch.  This \\u201cmall\\u201d consists of a lot of restaurants, souvenir vendors and other businesses. \\n    \\u2022 If you have mobility issues and can\\u2019t walk more than 4 miles - walking to and from the border and walking down Revolution Avenue, I would suggest taking a taxi or alternate transportation once you cross the border.  There should be taxis waiting along the route once you cross the border.\\n    \\u2022 If you need to use the washroom before heading into Tijuana, the \\u201cfree\\u201d one is at Jack in the Box at the last trolley stop.  The washroom facilities in the building that houses McDonald\\u2019s is a pay facility.  The washrooms at the top of the hill behind McDonald\\u2019s are also pay toilets.\\n    \\u2022 Check various websites for additional information\\n    \\u2022 After our trip to Tijuana, we went to Las Americas shopping outlet in San Ysidro.  The outlet is less than one mile from the trolley line stop.

I went on a Friday mid morning, I didn\\'t have any issues with long lines going to MX, or coming back, none at all. I will also tell you at no point did I ever feel afraid or uneasy, I felt very comfortable, safe, and welcomed there by everyone I came across and I always travel solo. This was my first trip to Mexico but I read previous reviews that travelers left so I knew where to go and where to stay at(in view of that Arch) lol.., and again I did a day trip and was gone by like 6:00pm. I met so many friendly people and bought back many cool souvenirs, and enjoyed just conversating with the store owners, everyone I encountered spoke English very well so there was no issue with that in case someone might be concerned. Many of the store owners told me how business was real slow due to all the warnings at that time. I cant say anyone was overly pushy, I dealt with way worse in Jamaica,but  just remember to be polite and respectful to everyone wherever you travel, and politely tell them no thank you if you are not interested. I had my small drawstring backpack and a couple bottles of water, I didn\\'t eat or drink anything there, but that\\'s just me. Also I highly advise you to either not drink alot of water, or like me you will have to &quot;hold it in&quot; until you get back to San Diego to go to a bathroom, seriously I saw a sign for the restroom but there was no way I was going near that from how it looked so I had to hold it in lol.. Also if you think you may be lost or just want to &quot;confirm&quot; you are going the right direction, there are always plenty of people to help you and police as well as border patrol, don\\'t be afraid to ask them. I somehow missed the beach, I guess I didn\\'t go down far enough so I can\\'t comment on that, but there are many places to buy cool souvenirs and t-shirts, and things and remember they will give you &quot;good deal&quot;, enjoy.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Avenida Revolucion", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Revolucion", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "562406667": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Negotiate with them!!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d152722-Reviews-Avenida_Revolucion-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "All I can tell you is you must negotiate with clerks any prices!

The entry was seemless we parked and walked over the bridge with a couple of US Border and Customs officials on their way to work who gave us a couple of tips and lessons in haggling. We were easily through the customs and visa check point and out onto the passageway up over the bridge and down onto the street. There is good directional signage and it\\'s easy to stick to to strip and get yourself to the market. To be his set the market in San Antonio was far better. The food the sights the sounds smells and shopping! There was none of the authenticity that we were expecting, just a lot of food vendors wanting us to dine in their restaurants. We moved to downtown and were equally unimpressed. It was full of the same shops selling the same stuff and so many pharmacies all trying to get you to buy Viagra  and Tramadol. The streets were freshly swept and clean and everyone had something to sell, but it just felt like another street in another city. And I have seen plenty in the past three weeks driving across America. We never felt unsafe and had a couple of laughs along the street with the shop keepers. We spent a very long time in the queue waiting to cross back over the border.

You also need to buy a day pass at the station which cost around $7 for an adult but will last the whole day. The ride is about 20 minutes and when you hop off at San Ysidro you are virtually next to the border crossing - just follow the crowd or ask someone if you can\\'t see the walkway. Tip - if you get to San Ysidro and change your mind last minute- dont stress , head over to the Las Americas premium outlets which are a ten minute walk from the station and shop instead - the trolley ride wasn\\'t wasted! \\n\\nNow I must admit that I was a little nervous about this trip, particularly with two teenage girls tagging along, but overall it was pretty good. It\\'s the usual process of be smart and don\\'t invite problems. We got over the border without issue (don\\'t forget your passports) and followed the advise by grabbing a taxi when we exited the other side (they are everywhere). We were going to revolution square to do a bit of souvenir hunting, have lunch and experience Mexico. The cost of the taxi (which I Pre checked with the driver before hopping in) was $8. The drive there was about 5 easy minutes and I gave the driver $10.\\n\\nOnce at Revolution Square it\\'s basically a long walk up one side of the road and then back down the other. You will be invited into every shop by every seller and also encouraged to take a photo with those donkeys painted up to look like Zebra\\'s. there are some very cool souvenirs so we basically browsed through a few shops and picked up a few gifts for ourselves and the people back home. We also stopped for some lunch which wasn\\'t bad and was very cheap ($20 for the four of us).\\n\\nWhen you have had enough of donkeys and souvenirs grab a taxi at the end of the road and ask them to take you back to the US boarder. This was probably the worst part of the trip as we waited for about two hours on a pretty hot day in a queue that was only partly covered. There are also a lot of street kids, disabled and old homeless people who beg, and sell things along the queue and the adjoining freeway, so you need to be accepting of this. \\n\\nOverall I am glad we went and it was a good experience for the family.

I had my evening meal at the La Casa Del Mole poblano, then returned to the Avenida Revolucion which seems to be the main street to while a way about 2 hours before my scheduled 9 pm return to the border. I spent a chunk of that time at the Praga Cafe (close to the junction of the 5th Avenue or Emiliano Zapata) drinking great coffee and watching TV but I spent about an hour strolling down the avenue. The Praga Cafe has a very lovely ambiance and very inviting modern decor. The menu look like it had some interesting stuff but I had already eating. What I saw people eating looked interesting though. The staff were young and spoke very good English. \\nThis avenue comes alive at night! The mariachis came out in full force serenading people. Lots of people were strolling and chatting loudly and seem to be having a lot of fun. There was a relaxed vibe about the whole place. The shops which seem to sell all sorts of things remained open till late. I did not buy anything as I really don\\'t do the touristy stuff much. There were lots of cafe which were full of people but an interesting place in the same block as the famous Caesar Hotel is called &quot;Quiky\\'s taco and fish&quot; a large 2 story glass fronted corner space at the junction of Calle Salvador Diaz Miron (4th Avenue). The glass doors were flung open and it was full of people (couples?) dancing to salsa music. It was enchanting. I have no idea if it is always like that or it\\'s a special occasion for those folks. They seem to be having a ball. I actually didn\\'t see anyone eating. Maybe a few folks had drinks. I stood watching for a while with other locals. I did wander beyond the arch down the hill to the less savoury part of town around Avenida Constitucion and Calle Benito Juarez. It was full of scantily clad girls looking for &quot;business&quot;. I found the place very uncomfortable and made a hasty retreat. I mean they were everywhere around that place and the city seem to have degenerated somewhat around that area. Beware! the police had a strong presence in town but thankfully I had no contact with them. I actually chattered my own taxi driver/guide for the 4-5 hours that I spent there. He waited for me while I did my thing although he went away when I was inside places we always set a time for him to return.

Let\\'s be honest. I visited TJ for the same reason as many Americans. There are those of us who want to claim foreign travel, but cannot afford the week long fancy cruises, airline tickets, hotel stays or other costs of foreign travel. TJ has little to do with the rich varied Mexican culture and history. The main tourist street has for a long time been a collection of small shops filled with Asian-made clothing and trinkets, tawdry bars, and pharmacies often offering drugs and services not available in the US. There were exceptions, a few quality drinking establishments and restaurants and a few US-based fast food chains. Actuary many males went for the places offering cheap sex. Then the drug wars ramped up and many Americans were scared off, helped by warnings from the US State Department. \\n\\nThings have changed. First, there is massive construction on both sides of the border station. The American building that stretched the width of the roadway is gone. Check the Internet for updates. In the meantime, entering Mexico is now done on the east side. It used to be just walk through a turnstile and go on your way. Now, you stop and show ID and fill out a former. I also saw soldiers, armed with rifles. Obviously, Mex6has ramped up its own security. It also puts you on the wrong side of the highway for crossing the bridge to downtown. Recommendation: take a taxi or use a shuttle from the US side.\\n\\nAvenue Revoluccion, the main tourist area is changing. TJ is obviously attempting a major upgrade to attract Norteamericanos and dollars. New construction is going up. Most of the old tawdry bars are gone. There is a transportation station going up in the middle of the street. Planters are being added to make it look more like a Boulevard. The jail Lai front on is still there. The fast food places are still there. But there are more nice bars and eating places. Some of the old stores are still there trading in jewelry and clothing. It won\\'t ever remind people of Rodeo Drive.  But it\\'s a large change for TJ.\\n\\nYes, for those interested, the tawdry bars are still available, or so I was told. You just won\\'t find them on Avenue Revoluccion. I am also not covering other areas or sights available in Tijuana as I am not much familiar with them. Others can fill in the holes or just use the Internet. Once again, I recommend a taxi back to the border. The route and traffic can make it a hassle but I have never been cheated by a TJ cabbie. The US station has also switched sides at least temporarily. Adding technology has speeded things up somewhat and the US has a special card available to FastTrack things.

I had been through there on a bus going to San Diego from Ensanada in the early 2000s but we didn\\'t stop and I would have been scared because it looked unsafe.  This time we wanted to go get souveniers and see the area close to the border but in a safer area of TJ.  We decided to take a bus in as the walkway is a very long and busy area.  The bus line near Ross and the shopping center was a good cheaper choice.  They took us through customs.  3 of our 4 didn\\'t have a passport but we were just told to have one next time.  They scanned the bus and our personal belongings then we went on.  The bus had stopped at several places and picked up others so don\\'t be alarmed.  They dropped some passengers off at various locations then took us to a store where we got into a van that continued on to the Revolucion area.  They dropped us off at a store selling liquor where we got free tequilla shots.  They also introduced us to a cab driver Tito, who would take the 4 of us back to the border for $6 total. \\n\\nThe area is designed for tourists as there are shops galore along with many places to eat and drink.  Many of the stores sell the same things so we didn\\'t buy at 1st but wanted to walk and experience the area.  There are neat pieces of art work there and we saw several police officers so we felt safe.  One officer let us goof off and one leaned up on his car like she was being arrested while we took a pic.  He was very nice and funny.  \\n\\nShopping:  be prepared for aggressive shop people.  They will try to sell you multiple things and try to get you to come in their store.  They will bargain and haggle so don\\'t accept the price until you barter.  We found most would come down half price from their original price!  Street vendorswill come up and try to sell you silver and other items they carry but beware, we were told by the cop to watch as their quality is questionable with some of them.  Be prepared for children to come up and try to sell you trinkets too! We did buy from one street vendor, the man set up making name bracelets and necklaces or pins from wire.  He makes them right there in front of you and were very neat!  He has set prices and does not bargain but was very worth it as they were $5 and $9 I believe so not expensive for hand made items.  We did tip him as we loved how great the work was! \\n\\nWe did not eat while there but did buy bottle drinks at a store as it was hot.  We didn\\'t go off the main street and walked to the arch and back then were hot and tired so we decided to let Tito take us back.  His cab was blue and white.  Don\\'t be too scared of drivers in Mexico.  They are aggressive and blow their horns at each other and will put their car in an inch of space to get in a lane.  At one time we were 4 wide in what was supposed to be 2 lanes.  Lol  but we made it to the border and he took us right to the walkway to get through customs.  Customs was very busy and there were several lanes of people walking across so people with documents or passports got through faster than those of us with just drivers licenses.  We just gave our license, the customs officer punched it in and we were walking back into the USA.  \\n\\nIt was a great experience to see a different side of Tijuana than the dirty scary area we drove through years ago.  We felt very safe but wouldn\\'t venture there at night or alone.

We took the blueline trolley (really a light rail) down to San Ysidro from San Diego for a daytrip. The trolley/light rail was efficient but a little overpriced ($7 per person round trip). You have to walk past the McDonald\\'s at the San Ysidro station if you take the trolley down in order to access the border; don\\'t turn around and go to the bridge/walkway. That was a bit misleading and there weren\\'t a lot of signs to guide you. \\n\\nIt was unclear how far Tijuana was from the border. We didn\\'t realize that Tijuana was a 2 &amp;1/2 mile walk from the border, and considering the heat, we ended up taking a taxi. The taxi driver was extremely helpful and friendly; he was probably the best part of our trip! \\n\\nOnce we arrived at the arc, we were instantly flagged down by many shopkeepers who were rather aggressive in trying to reel in customers. I lost track of how many times I had to say, &quot;no thank you.&quot; I really felt like a walking wallet or perhaps a walking red flag. I\\'d much prefer to approach a shopkeeper if I want help rather than have him/her approach me before I even enter a store. This aggressive approach does not seem to be the most effective marketing strategy, as shoppers seem to end up feeling more annoyed than interested. \\n\\nThere was at least one nice clothing store where the prices were set and the shopkeepers weren\\'t aggressive but that seemed to be the exception rather than the norm. I also don\\'t understand the hype around taking one\\'s picture with the &quot;zonkeys.&quot; Those poor animals must be sweltering in the heat. \\n\\nI\\'d recommend going to Tijuana only for the experience of travelling to a different country and because it is good to get out of your comfort zone sometimes. Maybe there\\'s something I just didn\\'t &quot;get&quot; about Avenida Revolucion because it was my first time.

We really wanted to visit Tijuana. We started off by taking the Red Trolley (really a light rail) on the Blue Line. The Blue Line took us right to the border at San Ysidro. There was a money exchange place. It was confusing which direction to go. We saw a large Mexican flag, so we headed in that direction, walking on a large walkway. When we got off, we had no idea where we were. We saw border guards and asked them. They told us to go back the way we came and to behind the McDonalds (by the last trolley stop). Behind the McDonalds, we followed a narrow lane to the border check, where our passports were stamped. As we emerged from there, we were confused where to go. There were loads of taxis (we were under the impression we could walk to the Avenida Revolucion--we could not. A very nice taxi driver spoke in English and gave us very good tips. He dropped us off at 1st and Revolucion. He advised us not to venture beyond 6th Street, because beyond that, the area is not patrolled. We noted a police car parked on the street. The taxi cab driver also advised us to wait by a pharmacy on the corner of 2nd St. when we needed a taxi to return. My family and I immediately felt like &quot;tourists with a red flag&quot;. We really stood out. Most merchants accept American dollars, but some only accept pesos--so it is a good idea to exchange money in San Ysidro (border--close to McDonalds). I exchanged a $20.00 for pesos. Not knowing the exchange rate, my pesos were gone by the first vendor.. Exchagning $40.00 is probably a better idea. I know I was &quot;taken&quot; by the first vendor on the right. There were three men, so with all talking to me at once, I was confused. I purchased a hat and a sugar skull. They kept trying to talk me into buying other things. One of the men said, &quot;Package deal.&quot; (this refers to items added on - who knows if one really gets a discount. One of the men said (regarding pesos) &quot;Two and then one for me--beer&quot;, As we walked, there were men along the street trying to sell things--very aggressive. Three little girls approached my daughter. She gave the one girl $5.00, but the girl still stood by my daughter (I guess looking for more--my daughter speaks and understands Spanish pretty well, but she was unable to determine what the little girl was saying or wanted), holding her little tray of small toys and gum. I felt so bad for the girls, but we had to move on. In one of the street vendor\\'s store, (around 4th or 5th St) where a woman, Rosita, greeted me. She was very kind, and I was not &quot;taken&quot;. There I purchased two belts and a charm for a necklace. She had real silver charms. On the corner of 4th St. on the right (may have been 3rd), there was a nice store-a real store with set prices. I purchased a nice pair of sneakers for $20 and two soccer shirts. We walked to 6th Street, turned around, and walked up the other side of Revolucion (now facing the arch). I stopped in a vendor with a few leather goods (my family was anxious to get back, so they waited for me). I finally saw leather hats I had seen in pictures. Unfortunately, the hat did look good on me, so I did not buy it. We walked to the pharmacy (same side) and caught another cab. The driver was quiet (I don\\'t think he spoke English), however, he did an awesome job navigating through very heavy traffic and through a large chaotic circle (I thought only NJ had those!). Then we walked back to the border check. That whole area was cement, wire, and grafitti--very poor and very urban. There was a very very long line to get back into the US. Eventually we were called and our passports and purchases were checked. It was a relief to get back onto the Red Trolley--which was waiting by the McDonalds. My daughter said she felt like a &quot;walking wallet&quot; the entire time. I agreed. It is very hot, so take a hat with you--don\\'t buy it in Tijuana. Head left by the McDonalds when you get off the trolley--not right, where the walkway and Mexico flag are. There are tons of border patrol agents, so do not be surprised. Have your passports out. Expect  the area to the taxis to look very urban and poor. Take a taxi by all means. We were under the impression we could walk to Avendido Revolucion. It would have been a very long and hot walk with tons of traffic and no place to walk on the street. I had read where Avienda Revolucion is one of the great shopping places (it is not what I expected). When we asked a border patrol officer how to get there, he had no idea what we were talking about. The taxi drivers were awesome--especially the first. The cab fare was $8.00. We gave  him a $10.00. Know that there was no food, some small vendors close to the taxis. We did not buy any. Please do not take a large purse/pocketbook. Use sunscreen. Bring a large bottle of water with you. Expect to be hot. Also, families--do not be surprised at how many sex/porn places there are as well as pharmacies selling Viagra and Cialis. The day was interesting, but we could not wait to get back to the US.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Avenida Revolucion", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Revolucion", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "400148356": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "This is the place to go for souvenirs in TJ", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d152722-Reviews-Avenida_Revolucion-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Revolucion street is where everyone goes for souvenirs.

On the 2nd day of our stay we decided to visit Tijuana.  We drove down 5 south to one of the public parking lots next to the border (you can also take the trolley to San Ysidro). Instead of walking across the border, we elected to take a shuttle from the parking lot to downtown Tijuana.  Although the driver knew how to deftly navigate traffic, be forewarned, the ride is not for the faint of heart ($10 round trip per person + I tipped the driver). The shuttle will drop you off at the border and wait for your group to make their way through the Mexican border crossing.  Crossing was fairly easy and took 10 minutes (~9am) ; you fill out a simple form and show them your passport.  Once the group were okay to pass, we made our way through security.  Our driver was waiting for us on the other side.  He drove us to Avenida Revolucion and dropped us off at one of their shuttle stops (near 6th and 7th).  \\nOnce there we visited the numerous shops, had a couple of carne asadas, a few cervesas/margaritas, and test-tasted some tequila.  Shop owners were friendly and are definitely willing to haggle.  Most of what is sold amounts to cheap souvenirs.  Wife and I bought a couple of small items but nothing significant.  The area is fairly rundown--don\\'t expect a modern looking shopping district.  As you might imagine, stores and restaurants are always approaching you to come in (even pharmacies).  But no one was ever rude or overly pushy. There\\'s a good polic\\u00eda presence there; never felt as if we weren\\'t safe.  Once we made our way around most of the shops, we ventured to a side street.  After we spotted numerous call girls lining the block, we turned around and made our way back to the shuttle stop.  In total we were there about 4 hours.  It was cool to say I was there but wouldn\\'t go back.  If there\\'s a means to invest in the area, I could see it becoming a much better place to visit. However as a married couple, I would look for another location to visit.  \\nOur same shuttle driver took us back across to the US.  We ended up having to go to the next border crossing location as Tijuana was backed up.  Border crossing into the US took about an hour.  Was kind of cool; there are musicians and people selling snacks/drinks while you wait in line.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "2"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Avenida Revolucion", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Revolucion", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "341261537": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Exactly what you\\'d expect - and that\\'s a good thing!", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d152722-Reviews-Avenida_Revolucion-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "If you go to TJ, this is pretty much the destination.

The happening street in TJ is Avenida Revolucion which is approx. 5-10 min. walk once you cross the border.  Crossing the border into TJ is fast, but be prepared for a wait upon your return as you will have to go through customs, and don\\'t forget your passport or passport card!  There is no cost for this activity, but do plan to bring some cash so that you can shop.  You can get some great deals if you know how to dicker.  Do not be shy about dickering as it is expected, so if you don\\'t, you will be paying far more than the going price.  I tested this by dickering (bargaining) for the same item--a backgammon board--with several different vendors who had differing starting prices and discovered that if one dickers long enough with each vendor, one will end up with the same final price!\\nSome fun, but free or cheap activities in TJ are as follows: You can enjoy the sound of Mariachis which will make you feel that you are truly in a foreign country even though you may live just a few miles from the border!  There are lots of places to get super cheap Margaritas--just be sure to order them without ice as ice is afterall made from their water! (That is if you do not wish to experience Turista aka Montezuma\\'s Revenge.)  If you want water in a restaurant, be sure to ask for bottled water!  Agua Caliente racetrack is always a fun visit and is free unless you bet.  I will usually place one tiny bet to either Win, Place, or Show depending on the horse I am betting on, just to make the race a little more exciting.  If you can go on a day when they are having greyhound racing, it is even more fun, because you can view the greyhounds being weighed right before the race.  I usually look to see which greyhound seems to be more spirited and bet on that dog as I believe it ups my chances of winning.  It\\'s fun to watch the greyhounds chase the mechanical rabbit around the track, but what would be even more fun would be to something I have heard about but haven\\'t had an opportunity to see: some days monkeys are dressed like jockeys and ride the greyhounds.  I have yet to discover when this happens and sometimes believe that it is just a rumor, but several different people have told me that this DOES happen!

Almost anywhere along the avenida you are bombarded by noise coming from bars, restaurants, pharmacies(!), it often feels like you are listening to three or four songs at the same time.\\n\\nIt is the Revo nightlife that shines as it\\'s stand out element for the young and young at heart. With the sexta, there are so many venues for punk gigs, banda music, 80s cheese, more modern music and old fashioned cantina style drinking that everone will find something to do. There is a large place on one corner that pretends it is a fish taco restaurant: on the right nights the whole floor is packed with people dancing to salsa music, sometimes so many they spill onto the street. It is a sight to behold!\\n\\n The food options are good late at night too, especially around the weekends as there are some very nice pizza places such as the ferreteria and a good burger and hotdog place on the sexta that have vegetarian and vegan options.It is a busy place, day and night.

It was about 1:00am on the wee hours of Saturday morning.  After some initial questions such as where we\\'ve been and where were going, he said we\\u2019d be subject to a drug search.\\n\\nThey asked us to place our hands on the police car as they dug aggressively through our pockets.  Throughout, they asked pointed questions about where we lived and where we were born.  The officers weren\\'t rude, but they weren\\'t polite either.  There was just something less-than-professional about their demeanor.\\n\\nWhat was most terrifying was that the search occurred in a quiet section of Revolution Ave where few witnesses were around.  Our fears were that these cops would plant drugs and set us up for extortion.\\n\\nAfter it was obvious we had no drugs, the cops adopted a more conciliatory tone about needing to combat drug trafficking.  I told him I understood his mandate and that I didn\\'t mind the inconvenience.  Then, he let us go.\\n\\nI understand the city\\'s effort to combat drug trafficking and organized crime.  But surely, the officers could have conducted these random searches in a more reassuring manner, one that wouldn\\'t chase away the few remaining tourists that are still visiting Tijuana.\\n\\nFor example, I read recently how Tijuana police are now equipped with body cameras.  The cops could have assured us of a fair search by giving the option of having the search video-recorded.  They could also have said we could summon tourist police for help before the search began or to invite us to a more well-lit, more populated area to conduct the search.  Lastly, the cops could have given us their names and badge numbers.\\n\\nAside from this unsettling ordeal, I was surprised Tijuana cleaned up dramatically.  It\\'s been ten plus years since my last trip.  Now, there are fewer beggars, less street prostitution and the street simply looked better.  But prices also have gone up.  Don\\'t expect cheap drinks and food anymore.\\n\\nEqually noticeable was the lack of tourists.  It was Friday night and most bars and restaurants were 80% empty, and most patrons were locals.  There was something wild and crazy about Tijuana of the 1990s.  Now, it\\'s just a subdued street with a few bars and US prices.

Sure I had heard and read about all the trouble that is going on down there but that didn\\u2019t deter us. We hoped on the trolley which a few minutes before the border we had to get off and get on buses because there was an accident on the track. No problem. We boarder and a few minutes later we were walking up a little path to the Entrance\\u201d of Mexico. There was no problem going over into Mexico. They didn\\u2019t even look at our passport. I noticed the long line of people standing in line to get over into the US. After changing US dollars into Pesos, ($10.00 for  140 Pesos at the time we visited) we caught a taxi,( $6.00) to take us into town a few blocks away that we could have walked. We were let off in front of La Pasitos Mexican Restaurant and givien a phone number to call when we were ready to go back to the border. We began walking down Avenue Revolucion stopping in stores that caught our eye. Tried to take a picture of the \\u201cFamous\\u201d donkey, which is painted like a Zebra,  but was told not to unless we paid $2.00 for the privilege. No thank you and we walked away. As we moved along the sidewalk, I notice that the store owners invited us in but was not pushy which I liked right off. We then enter into this one shop that had all kinds of leather goods, \\u201cGloris Curios and Boots\\u201d,  out on the sidewalk. My traveling companion was looking for something to buy to take home to her father. The owner/ manager, Sergio,  came to greet us.  A very pleasant man. He actually spent some time with my friend explaining to her the difference between \\u201cfake\\u201d leather and \\u201creal\\u201d leather which I believe she appreciated. The item that she wanted was priced at US $35.00 and I was able to get it down to $25. She still had her doubts. He saw her hesitation and then lowered it to $15.00 and I told her to take it. She still hesitated and I then thanked him and left the store. Needless to say I was upset because I would have taken it even at $35.)) but she was new to traveling and on her own and did not know the ways of traveling or bargaining. She left Tijuana without the bag saying that her father would think that it was too expensive a gift. Both  Sergio and I said that he didn\\u2019t need to know the price, it was a gift. Oh well, what can I say. We walked up one side of the street and down the other, looking into other stores. Outside the La Pasitos restaurant there was a street vendor who had a nice display of Jewelry. Some real sterling, some not. She was now looking for a little ring to buy for herself. He introduced himself as Raymond . He smiled and talked at length about his little table display of items. He also warned us about not going past 1st street and I asked why not and he said that it was the red light district and they don\\u2019t even go there. Enough said. Shortly thereafter my friend walked away and into another shop called the Emporium and I am so glad she did because soon after, I followed her in. I stopped at a case that had jewelry in it and I noticed that there were tags on different items stating what they were.  He had identified items that were \\u201creal\\u201d Sterling Silver, and the fakes. He even shared with me that fact that some shop owner will even go so far as to STAMP the items with the 925 stamp causing unsuspecting people to think that they are getting the real thing until they happen to come in to the Emporium and find out the error and march right back to the store and get their money back. We stood and talked for a long time while my traveling buddy was busy with the other attendant trying to decide on a \\u201cTurquoise/ Sterling ring. I have always been fascinated by the colorful pottery and ceramics and this store had shelves and shelves of it. I just stood there with mouth open and marveled at all the many pieces. I saw a little plate/saucer that I like and Jesus went into the history of the ceramic piece and I am so grateful that he did. My first concern was whether it had lead in it and it did not. It was a piece of Talvera ceramic that is handmade and signed by the artist. The clay that they use is found in select areas and one of them is Puebla, Mexico. My piece was packed as if it were going on a journey of a thousand miles (which it was). I noticed when back out on the streets that there were not many \\u201ctourist-Looking\\u201d people out and about that I could tell. I remember Jesus telling me that it is  really depressed because people are afraid to come anymore because of all the news headlines, which if one travels as I do, that could be just about anywhere and I don\\u2019t go to those places anyway. I keep to the well-traveled path of the tourist, but then again anything can happen anywhere at any time. I will tell you that I felt safe, unhurried and the people were very friendly.

Therefore, don\\'t expect to find all that is great about Tijuana all on Av Revolucion.\\n\\nRevolucion is now but a fraction of Tijuana\\'s offering to tourists with an adventurous spirit. To find the best of the city, you will have to dig a bit.\\n\\nAs for Revolucion itself, it is repopulating with newer establishments every month. In addition to bars &amp; restaurants, cliche tourist trinkets, and more street vendors selling bacon-wrapped hot dogs than street tacos, there are newer tourist treasures.\\n\\nThe issue is - they are not pushed on tourists because they are not aimed at tourists. They are part of Tijuana\\'s home-grown culture, seen only by thosr who look for them. For that reason, only tourists who truly enjoy a bit of exploration will find them - things like a growing hipster population and bohemian sector tucked in secret alleyways, a busy nightlife scene with popular dance clubs that only come to Life at Night, and even a growing technology space.\\n\\nThe bottom line is not that Avenida Revolucion is not what it used to be, it\\'s that Tijuana is so much more now and it\\'s spread out over greater area. Places like Zona Rio for restaurants, shopping, and business districts with modern architecture; Gallerias Hipodromo for shopping and a remarkable view of Tijuana at night; and roundabouts featuring large city monuments, including one of US President Abraham Lincoln, which looks a bit surreal illuminated with neonish blue ground lighting.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t any easy way to discover these fascinating things... and some really are fascinating. You won\\'t find them by googling Tijuana, which often yields years-old search results which innacurately describe Tijuana. Tijuana is a place of rapid change, where the influences of its US neighbor collide with the city and influence progress at a remarkable pace.\\n\\nOn a final note, you can easily still find delicious street tacos within walking distance of the border, including some pretty good (although not #1) 24 hour street tacos. The difference is, in 2015, you\\'ll want to order an Uber ride to arrive at one of the best street-style tacos in Tijuana, Tacos el Franc.\\n\\nAn exciting world awaits you in Tijuana. Don\\'t be afraid, it\\'s relatively safe now. Just exercise caution and respect your surroundings. Do some research first and  look at current articles to find the best of what Tijuana has to offer.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Avenida Revolucion", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Revolucion", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "242458637": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Revolution street", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d152722-Reviews-Avenida_Revolucion-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "Classic tourism street.

It is a tourisy place and people do pressure you into being their junk but if you are not a gullible traveler you should be fine. I actually had a lot of fun. It is very LGBT/GAY friendly there are many great bars to go. On the weekends they sometimes have different festivals.

I never felt threatened or that my safety was in jeopardy in any way. If you come to Tijuana, this place is a must. My only complaint is that Tijuana in general is not as cheap as I thought it would be and if taxi drivers or shopkeepers could smell the tourist in you then they will try to charge you more because you have dollars!

While I don\\'t think that the prices are all that much of a deal, it still provides some fun banter while you are out and about.

And, I don\\'t know how they know you were only in Tijuana less than 72 hours.\\n\\nTry not to look like a tourist, although it\\'s not so easy.  They pinned us immediately, and my boyfriend is Spanish.\\n\\nBe aware of the conversion so you don\\'t get had.  \\n\\nThere are plenty of taxis, but you don\\'t need one if your just going downtown.

We are world travelers and believe everything is worth seeing once. To avoid all the long lines we went with a tour that dropped us off here for a few hours.

We were really on the look out for little pieces of hand made stuff that would sell for much more in the U.S. and we found some cute things that were obviously hand made (not made in china that we saw). The sad part was being ripped off at the very good lunch we had. They charged us as much for the two CANS of diet coke as they did for our whole meal (we didnt think to ask the price of them) plus a 15% tax. We simply took out a bill and told them it was all we had and they took it. That doesnt help turism, we were glad we went but would never go back, there are too many other things to see in the world, but it was definatly worth a visit. We waited about 5 minutes at the boarding crossing with the tour.

Mostly the scene on Revolucion is small groups of visitors rather haplessly wandering around as though they really hope the next block will bring something worth the trip.

We were supposed to take the Red Bus and went to the parking lot where they leave from on the U.S. side.  Instead we were put in a white van that cost more (not a lot more) which we learned when we arrived at the drop off in TJ on Avenida Revolucion at the corner of the 6th Avenue and La Revolucion.  We immediately noticed almost all (if not all) of the upstairs restaurants and clubs are now vacant and run down.  As we walked along the street we were acosted by every merchant and restaurant all the way down to the Arch (looks like the St. Louis arch) where we turned left into a shopping district.  This section of TJ seemed less aggressive and the meals were cheaper as were the beers and other drinks.  Still I would say that you are better off eating at Tapa Tia\\'s in Imperial Beach because the food is better and you don\\'t have to be mugged by every merchant in town.  Also we noticed that very few white folks were on the Avenida still.  We didn\\'t feel threatened but just were cautious (and we have travelled all over the world.)  We had to get a time (can\\'t just walk up and buy a ticket to go back to San Diego on the vans) and ended up waiting two hours for the next van.  Then it took about 2 hours to get across the border.  This was a Saturday but still it was a miserable trip for very little fun.  The shops all have the same purses, belts, blankets etc. so it is really quite boring now.  Without the night life (I would never go to TJ at night until I had reason to believe it was much more recovered than it is now.)  All in all I think it is a good idea to stay in San Diego and not go through the hassle.  There are other crossings into TJ and Mexico but my question is why go?

It was a hot day, and I was with my two teenage children who had never been to the west coast. I decided to take them to Tijuana (so they could go back home and tell their friends they had been to Mexico), although I know TJ is not a representation of what Mexico is really like.\\n\\nThis street is lined with shops, shops, restaurants, bars, pharmacies, shops, restaurants, bars, pharmacies. Did I forget to mention that it has a lot of shops? We couldn\\'t walk in peace because every owner, along with their wives/husbands, children, in-laws, and everybody else were hounding us, almost forcing us into their shops to buy things we had no use for or didn\\'t care for.\\nAt one point I left my 16 year-old daughter a couple of steps behind me and when I looked back I was shocked to see that a vendor, who apparently was selling silver trinkets, had actually put handcuffs on her! She was calling out to me, but because of all the street noise I couldn\\'t hear her. I immediately told him to take them off and I, and my kids made a beeline to a taxi to get back to the border and cross over the the U.S. side. She told me that he was hounding her for her to buy his wares and put the handcuffs on her so she could see. These people really, really don\\'t take no for an answer. My son was extremely annoyed and couldn\\'t wait to go back to the hotel in San Diego.\\n\\nThis place is very busy, and there are a lot of beggars in the street. A young girl with a toddler boy approached me asking for money. I asked her what she needed to money for, and she told me she needed it to feed her baby. She was dirty, her clothes were dirty and her hair was matted. I took her to KFC so she could buy whatever she wanted for her and her child. I don\\'t give money at all...ever. This young girl told me she wasn\\'t going to eat in the restaurant because her son didn\\'t like to eat in public which I found so very odd. She wouldn\\'t look me in the face at all, and seemed to be nervous and in a rush. I helped her with her son and once she got her food she was gonna walk away without saying anything to me. I held her back and told her to look me in the face. She wasn\\'t able to really and I knew she had something else in her mind. She didn\\'t want to be bothered with what I was telling her.\\n\\nAs we parted ways, I store guard stopped me and told me about the girl. Everybody knows who she is and she has a guy who sends her out on the street to beg and takes all of her money. She uses her son as a catch. I spoke to the guard about my personal beliefs. He told me she was going to sell the food, and I asked him who would buy food from her not knowing what\\'s actually in the food.\\n\\nFive minutes later, my son saw the same girl, with her son, but no KFC bag. The boy only had a small cup of soda from KFC. What happened to all the food I bought for her? My son keeps telling me that she sold it. If she did or not, that\\'s her problem, but it kinda saddened me to see this girl in that predicament.\\n\\nMoral of this story...don\\'t get sucked into paying $20 for a meal for a beggar in the street. Next time, I\\'ll make sure the person eats it in front of me, or at least some of it.\\n\\nI think I\\'m done with Tijuana, and I don\\'t think I\\'ll be returning ever again, and if I do, I\\'ll make sure not to stroll down Avenida Revolucion.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Avenida Revolucion", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Revolucion", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "130907648": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "good shopping for tourists", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d152722-Reviews-Avenida_Revolucion-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "The day trip to Tijuana is a good mix of fun, shopping &amp; adventure.

I decided to take a bus tour which turned out to work in my favor because the guide dropped us off in the middle of Avenida Revolucion, gave us some shopping and other tips and apparently crossing the border back into the US is quicker if you are part of a bus tour.\\n\\nThe shopkeepers are indeed very pushy, they keep an eye on you, watching what stores you do go in, so they can ask why you went into that store but can\\'t come into into theirs?  The best action is really just to smile and keep walking because saying no thanks really doesn\\'t help and seems to be more of a conversation starter, whereas if you don\\'t speak up at all and just keep walking, they seem to get the hint quicker.  Some shopkeepers try to step in your way to try and usher you in, while others come up to you while you are waiting to cross the street with an armful of necklaces for you to look at, so it\\'s best to be aware of what\\'s going on around you at all times.  \\n\\nDespite the abrasive sales tactics, many of the local people are very polite and will trip over themselves to be nice to you when you actually are interested in buying something.  I befriended a woman on the bus tour who walked around with me and she was a master at negotiating prices, which is a MUST.  If you reject the first price you can usually get them to accept sometimes half or less of what they originally wanted.  \\n\\nThere is a shop on the main strip of Avenida Revolucion called Hand Art that is really worth looking for, it showcases a lot of homemade table cloths, table runners and place mats that are out of this world.  There is a group of stores along the street that are a part of Tijuana\\'s &quot;Outstanding Hosts&quot; which highlights some of the best shops for tourists. \\n\\nI was somewhat apprehensive about going to Mexico alone but I\\'m very happy I made the trip to go shopping on Revolucion.

Over here!&quot;). \\n\\nI almost expected them to charge across the street, and drag us over. \\n\\nThe poverty of Tijuana was sad, with the stray dogs seeking shade, &quot;Tijuana Zebras&quot; baking in the sun (all had food and water), but I don\\'t regret the few hours I spent across the border (I stayed in Chula Vista, CA). \\n\\nAll in all, however, it was astounding at how different two places can be despite being just a few miles apart (i.e. San Diego and Tijuana).\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Avenida Revolucion", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Revolucion", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "2308129": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Americanized", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d152722-Reviews-Avenida_Revolucion-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I went to Tijuana one afternoon last summer. Having been there for the first time two years prior, I could not believed how cleaned up the touristy area of Tijuana was. We had dinner at TGI Fridays, with 80\\'s pop music in the background. Some of the seedier shops and bars also seemed to have closed down, replaced by American fast food restaurants. Far fewer people trying to lure us (two women) into upstairs bars (especially considering it was getting dark out, while our last trip was in early afternoon), and we saw many cops patroling the newly paved sidewalks. Another consequence of the Tijuana clean-up was the prices: goods generally seemed higher priced than last time (although still cheap by US standards).\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Avenida Revolucion", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Revolucion", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}, "1724105": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Review", "name": "Two hours is enough", "url": "/Attraction_Review-g150776-d152722-Reviews-Avenida_Revolucion-Tijuana_Baja_California.html", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "author": "a TripAdvisor user", "reviewBody": "I was on a business trip to San Diego a few weeks ago and took a half day tour &quot;down mexico way&quot; You can take full and half day tours to Tijuana.

After passing through a clangy metal revolving gate, you\\'ll find yourself in the customs area.   At this point, you\\'ll need to decide whether to walk or cab it to &quot;la revol&quot;.  The cab ride is universally $5 no matter how many passengers (they will squeeze your entire party into one cab), no tip needed.  Walking to &quot;la revol&quot; is free and should take you about 15-20 minutes, even though you\\'ll be told it takes much longer by the cab hawkers.\\n\\nWalking is safe during the daytime, but only suggested at nighttime for groups of 4 or more (males helpful).  Walking is a great idea because along the way you\\'ll pass many a vendor of the souveniers you are probably interested in--start browsing and see what prices you are offered.  Believe it or not, about every third or fourth store should have a near duplicate of something you\\'re interested in.\\n\\nThe best way to bargain:  if you really want something, express casual interest in the item and ask how much it costs.  You\\'ll be highballed a price, or you\\'ll be asked what you want to pay (best response here:  &quot;I\\'m not sure if I want to buy it&quot;).  Thank the shopkeeper and slowly walk towards the exit.   9 times out of 10, the price will decrease at this point or you will be asked &quot;make me an offer&quot; (use same response above).  Continue (slowly) to leave the store.  The process may continue a few times, up to the point where you have actually exited the store.  If you are not followed up to about two stores away from the store, the last price offered is the &quot;going rate&quot; at this store.   Now you just need to repeat the same spiel again at 2-3 more stores to get the &quot;going rate&quot; there, and you\\'ll have a rough idea of what the item you\\'re interested in might sell for that particular day.  There are some department stores on the revol--if an item has a price tag on it and/or you see a cash register and can pay with credit card, then bargaining is most likely inappropriate.\\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "itemReviewed": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Avenida Revolucion", "image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/18/b7/d8/avenida-revolucion.jpg", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Avenida Revolucion", "addressLocality": "Tijuana", "addressRegion": "Baja California", "postalCode": "", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "Mexico"}}}}}}
