Surfing is awesome as well as sea kayaking, rock climbing, bicycling and having a picnic on the beach with some amazing tacos from one of the nearby taco stands.\n\nThe downtown area has made some improvements and is starting to look a little more like a real tourist town but if you drive even a block off of the main road you will be in gang infested neighbourhoods full of gang graffiti and all the negative things that go with that such as drugs, violence and prostitution. There are very few street signs making it difficult to get around and the stop signs are small and sometimes in the middle or the road or to one side and can be obscured by bushes etc. Many of the traffic lights do not work so be very very careful. Also be very careful not to hit the kids who stand in the street begging for donations for Red Cross and other non-profit groups. \n\nThere are still a lot of problems with the emergency response services so if you need to get to a hospital have someone take you.  The police force is improving but still has some problems with corruption.  Tourist police do not speak english well and neither do emergency operators. 078 tourist assistance line is still not functioning from Movistar phones or from most US cell phones.  To report corruption or other problems you are supposed to call 072 which also does not work from Movistar or US cell phones and no alternate number or online reporting system is in place.\n\nTaxis can be a bit scary to ride in and unfortunately they do not meet you at the border when you walk across and finding the Rosarito Group Taxis in Tijuana is quite difficult. Service in general in restaurants and hotels is poor but food is good. You will most likely need to flag down a waiter to get drinks refilled, ask for your bill etcn and there is a 16% tax plus you still need to tip.. That said the food is occasionally amazing and reasonably priced.  Bring only small bills as it is difficult to change anything higher than a 20 but the good news is most places take US Dollars.  \n\nYou can expect to see lots of barbed wire and fenced in areas that are very off-putting but necessary due to the security issues in Rosarito. Most hotels and condo complexes are gated with security for a reason. Deportees and homeless people and drug addicts will often ask for money on the steets. Hardworking vendors will approach you often trying to sell anything they have to offer. Be patient with them. They are trying to make a living and may literally be hungry. Children who should be in school can also often be seen trying to sell items to tourists, fixing potholes for pennies and performing on the streets which may upset you but consider the fact that schools run in two shifts so they may go later in the day. Consider buying a little something even if you don't need anything. Rosaritenses are hard working people and they depend on tourism dollars for their next meal.\n\nOne of the best things about Rosarito is the festivals they host which are vibrant and exciting as well as the cultural performances hosted by the city and state cultural institutions. Baja Sand held the last week in August is amazing and there are dozens of other festivals from blues to jazz to internationally acclaimed dance festivals. Unfortunately Rosarito does not have an online community portal so it is very difficult to get a clear idea of the events and activities in the area.\n\nTo thrive as a tourist town Rosarito should consider doing the following:\n1. Paint over all gang graffiti within 48 hours both in the main town and on the cuota.\n2. Improve emergency response systems and correct tourist assistance line and train all police in cpr/first aid and emergency response as well as english.\n3. Create an online reporting system where tourists can anonymously report their experiences or formally make a complaint as 072 is useless.\n4. Improve service in restaurants and hotels by training staff in customer service\n5. Add street signs, number lifeguard stands and beaches, number exits, standardize stop signs and make them larger, fix traffic lights and do not let child volunteers for the Red Cross or other groups stand on the street asking for donations. It is dangerous.\n6. Lower the volume. Music on the beach coming from clubs often has curse words and promotes violence and is inappropriate for families especially on a Sunday afternoon.\n7. Shut down all strip clubs anywhere in the city limitsbut especially on Popotla Boulevard which is the artisan district. What an embarrassment those clubs are and they bring violence, drugs, and prostitution which is NOT appropriate for a tourist town.\n8. Partner with private individuals to create and maintain a proper online community portal where anyone can add an event to the calendar and KEEP IT CURRENT.\n9. Venues should work much harder to promote their guest artists utilizng social media and all marketing materials should have maps with them.\n\nRosarito has a lot of natural beauty which is obscured by gang graffiti, unresolved security issues, corruption and filth. Some things I enjoy in Rosarito are the live performers, sandy beaches, fish markets, street markets, seals, sea lions and horses on the beaches and seeing dolphins and whales in their natural habitat.

The cafe's pies and muffins are delish. Very attentive and polite service. \n    Many people, American and Mexican, live in San Antonio del Mar year round. Other owners vacation there and rent out their homes the rest of the year.\n   Renting a house means a place to cook your own dinner, walk undisturbed on an uncrowded beach looking for sand dollars (LOTS at low tide) and see gorgeous sunsets over the Coronado Islands. \n    If you stay at a Rosarito hotel, your beach walks will be interrupted by multiple vendors selling beach wear and jewelry and your dining experiences may be limited on certain days of the week (many restaurants were closed on Tuesday).\n  For first time visitors to Mexico who might be worried about navigating the roads or finding places to buy food or dine out , this is a way to enjoy all the natural beauty of Baja with none of the hassle.  \n        \n  We brought a cooler with food, drinks, snacks, our own water, and of course lots of beer, wine and tequila. For the first few days, we just wanted to relax.  No one really wanted to make a tiresome and possibly long and confusing trek into town without knowing where to buy things. Later on in the week we could go on little excursions or out to eat.\n\n  Fortunately if you have to go out for little things, there is &quot;OXXO&quot;  the Baja version of 7-11. Gas, coffee, bottled water, snacks and some general household supplies are available there. There seems to be at least an OXXO on every third block in Rosarito. They all take, and give change in, US currency. No shortage of gas stations there, with people to pump your gas and clean your windshield--a nice surprise. \n  Wal-Mart was two exits away from our little beach community -- but a little different than those in the US. Not as well lit, kind of shadowy, but set up like a typical store with groceries on the left and clothes, etc on the right. \n They sell wine, beer and liquor, strategically placed in the center of aisles near the food. It was kind of bewildering looking for things. It's all in Spanish ! Study your dictionary before going !\n  Lines at certain times of the day are long, and no one seems to be in a hurry. Makes a case for bringing your own charcoal and lighter fluid, something that is probably there but which I could not find.\n   Bailey's cream liqueur for coffee was $13 a bottle. I managed to find that. Lots of fresh and delicious local vegetables and fruits too. Watermelon especially wonderful. Lovely complex Baja cabernets available for good prices.\n   At San Antonio del Mar we rented a three bedroom, three bath home with a two car garage, washer/dryer, satellite TV, wireless, with multiple upper and lower decks right on the ocean for $150 a night. Split between five people, you can see what a deal this is.  A fire pit on the lower deck for a driftwood fire. A BBQ grill for dinner. Tables for outdoor dining.\n  Early risers can see dolphins, pelicans and sea lions close enough to shore to get photos. Dogs welcome on the beach and in many of the rentals. At low tide the beach is wide and flat. Surfers can find a few shape-y waves when the tide is pushing in on the sand bar or travel two miles to the south to Baja Malibu for bigger waves.\n   Our first experience at San Antonio del Mar was a one-bedroom condo with a kitchen, nice living area and luxurious bed, perched high up on the cliffs. A pretty significant number of stairs down to the condo from the parking area and also down to the beach, not for people with bad knees. We had the beach all to ourselves and it felt remote and very private, with a high view off the sunny deck. That one was $75 per night--we felt like we couldn't go wrong for that price and got lots of exercise going up and down the stairs to the beach.\n  There are many other communities up and down the Baja peninsula on either side of the town of Rosarito yet to be explored , but San Antoinio del Mar was a great place to start !", "segments": [" It helps to shop and reserve before you go on &quot;vacation rentals by owner&quot; when traveling to Rosarito in Baja California, Mexico.

I speak Spanish fluently, and when I refused to offer a bribe but said I would rather go the police station to pay a fine legally, the officer took us to the station, opening a dark, stinking cell, and told us to get in. At that point, I said in Spanish, &quot;Ok, what do you want?&quot; He closed the door to the office and asked how much we had. Forty five dollars later, we were free...\n\nFree, that is, until the next day when we went into town to drop off our bag of trash from cleaning up our campground. The bag was in the back of my truck and, yes, had a couple of empty beer cans in it, so this time we were picked up for &quot;open containers.&quot; I went to the ATM but also called home. When my mom explained politely in Spanish that my dad is a San Diego sheriff and they would be happy to come and pay any fine, the policeman immediately said, &quot;No, it's okay-- they can go.&quot; \n\nSo be prepared: only cash or a badge will set you free.We have contacts in high places in Baja but still we were vulnerable-- and there are no guarantees you won't be asked to &quot;sign this form and we'll let you go&quot; and instead you have signed a confession."]}, "663486943": {"city": "san cristobal de las casas", "text": "Don\u2019t need a tour for this one. \nBought of my daughters liked it.

It was not publicized anywhere online or in any brochure at that time, and I heard about it via the owner of a B&amp;B where I stayed as I passed through San Cristobal de las Casas.   At that time it was simply a tranquil place that I enjoyed for an afternoon hike, with trees along walk paths chock-full of transplanted wild orchids and with many flowers and native plants freshly planted along  numerous under-construction walk paths.  I found this place was to someday become Orchideas Moxviquil (pronounced for me, or-kee-dee-us  mosh-va-keel ) a wild orchid and nature preserve.\n\nThen earlier this year I decided to return wanting to spend more time in one area I enjoyed most on my earlier journey, the state of Chiapas and in particular San Cristobal de las Casas.  I visited this time during early March for a three week stay and while further exploring the city I decided to head back to the garden.  The garden resided on the \u201cPeriferico Norte\u201d which means the north side of town on the loop that surrounds the city.   Back then and even on my most recent visit, the place is pretty obscure and hidden even though it is right next to the highway.   The only thing that marked it on my most recent visit was a sandstone looking half-rounded dome shaped building that is the green house.  Well probably a good thing I thought later as this place will like have a lot of people if it ever gets advertised.\n\nTo get there is probably a cab ride if coming from the central tourist areas for most, and certainly for me had I not been walking for the past couple of months but with all the exercise one gets in Mexico I decided to just walk there since I had been lucky enough to secure detailed English directions.  I simply needed to head north on the street of (?) Utrilla (north extension of Insurgentes) and at the end of it, turn left at the loop.   Then about a quarter mile on the right is the garden.\n\nMy how this place had changed!  I had not seen construction move this fast in my own country and certainly not in Mexico.   As I entered I caught up with a group of school children that was being taken through the facility with several teachers.   I watched and tried to brush up on my limited Spanish.  I made out the matter of ecology and proper handling of trash being discussed and what this meant to the environment, as well as a lecture on the types of plants and orchids indigenous to Chiapas that filled the new green house and lined the walkways.  (Side note \u2013 remarkable the work that is being done now regarding education on protecting the environment in Mexico, addressed where it counts, with the kids.)  \n\nI was delighted to get the unique privilege of hearing a presentation at \u201cmy level\u201d given to these grade-schoolers but the smiles on their faces and genuine excitement as they walked through the place were the true reward here.  Well about 30 kids were there and gone before I knew it and mostly off and on from then, just a tourist here and there as I had the place mostly to myself.  \n\nNow I would call out San Cristobal de las Casas as being one of the furthest away culturally from my normal Dallas life and as far as one can get while traveling within the shortest distance (well if you discount East Texas ;-).   But walking through this garden allowed me to move back to somewhere that was well off bounds from both the suburban sameness I had left behind and the Maya historical time machine where I had landed.   Nature it seems uniquely speaks to all of us in a calming fashion, providing an escape from it all and this area had been carefully and subtlety crafted to enhance that tranquility.  \n\nAs I walked I found an amphitheater carved out of earth, and walkways galore as I passed what seemed like every type of plant and flower that grew in the state.   Down new trails were recently stocked cascading ponds that were bio-balanced enough to be clear and supporting all kinds of aquatic life.   I got so lost at one point as to stop and watch the protocol of insects sparing and mating on the small rocks by the waterside.   There were tadpoles schooling and frogs croaking.  The sides of the ponds were populated with multiple varieties of indigenous grasses.

It was not publicized anywhere online or in any brochure at that time, and I heard about it via the owner of a B&amp;B where I stayed as I passed through San Cristobal de las Casas. At that time it was simply a tranquil place that I enjoyed for an afternoon hike, with trees along walk paths chock-full of transplanted wild orchids and with many flowers and native plants freshly planted along  numerous under-construction walk paths. I found this place was to someday become Orchideas Moxviquil (pronounced for me, or-kee-dee-us  mosh-va-keel ) a wild orchid and nature preserve. Then earlier this year I decided to return wanting to spend more time in one area I enjoyed most on my earlier journey, the state of Chiapas and in particular San Cristobal de las Casas. I visited this time during early March for a three week stay and while further exploring the city I decided to head back to the garden. The garden resided on the \u201cPeriferico Norte\u201d which means the north side of town on the loop that surrounds the city. Back then and even on my most recent visit, the place is pretty obscure and hidden even though it is right next to the highway. Well probably a good thing I thought later as this place will like have a lot of people if it ever gets advertised. To get there is probably a cab ride if coming from the central tourist areas for most, and certainly for me had I not been walking for the past couple of months but with all the exercise one gets in Mexico I decided to just walk there since I had been lucky enough to secure detailed English directions. I simply needed to head north on the street of (?) Utrilla (north extension of Insurgentes) and at the end of it, turn left at the loop. As I entered I caught up with a group of school children that was being taken through the facility with several teachers. I watched and tried to brush up on my limited Spanish. I made out the matter of ecology and proper handling of trash being discussed and what this meant to the environment, as well as a lecture on the types of plants and orchids indigenous to Chiapas that filled the new green house and lined the walkways. I was delighted to get the unique privilege of hearing a presentation at \u201cmy level\u201d given to these grade-schoolers but the smiles on their faces and genuine excitement as they walked through the place were the true reward here. Well about 30 kids were there and gone before I knew it and mostly off and on from then, just a tourist here and there as I had the place mostly to myself. Now I would call out San Cristobal de las Casas as being one of the furthest away culturally from my normal Dallas life and as far as one can get while traveling within the shortest distance (well if you discount East Texas ;-). But walking through this garden allowed me to move back to somewhere that was well off bounds from both the suburban sameness I had left behind and the Maya historical time machine where I had landed. Nature it seems uniquely speaks to all of us in a calming fashion, providing an escape from it all and this area had been carefully and subtlety crafted to enhance that tranquility. As I walked I found an amphitheater carved out of earth, and walkways galore as I passed what seemed like every type of plant and flower that grew in the state. Down new trails were recently stocked cascading ponds that were bio-balanced enough to be clear and supporting all kinds of aquatic life. I got so lost at one point as to stop and watch the protocol of insects sparing and mating on the small rocks by the waterside. The sides of the ponds were populated with multiple varieties of indigenous grasses. I can\u2019t begin to describe all the varieties of plants in the humid and jungle-like greenhouse or the beautiful small ponds that were inside (ponds and a local habitat water reproduction in a greenhouse are an oddity but certainly enhance the experience). I am no botanist, but all I can say this thing was an absolute delight. After my tour of the greenhouse and as I walked about, I ran into the main overseer of the project, Cisco Dietz and two businessmen who were discussing a contribution so I didn\u2019t want to interrupt but later returned and spoke with Cisco where I commended him on how the project had improved and I let him know I hadn\u2019t seen anything this nature centric in a long time while I could only compare it to my own city\u2019s Dallas World Aquarium.

Luckily I did some digging and found this place, which was fantastic and just as magical as the more famous places, but only two hours from the city, and thus possible on a day trip. \nI would recommend getting a guide just b/c driving in the city can be intimidating for the uninitiated, and I found it easier to go with someone who could take us there and back and take care of the tolls, parking and entrance fees. We used El Planeto Mexico and were extremely happy with them.

But here's the thing--you can't really go early to beat the crowds b/c the noon-time sun is what gets the most butterflies moving. That said, if it looks like its' going to be a good sunny day, you could try getting there around 2, when the sun is still strong but (it seems) more tourists have already done the trip. But be aware that if it's cloudy, or not around noon, there won't be many butterflies flying; instead they'll just clinging to the branches (and I think everyone has to leave by 4). In the end tho, it was totally fine. When we got to the main monarch area my camera was just pointed up and at flowers, so it didn't matter about the crowds; there were plenty of butterflies for all. I'm the kind of person who hates to be on a crowded trail, but it didn't detract from the magic in this case.  \nYou can rent horses to take you up, but you'll still have to walk the final way. I read previous reviews that said the horses don't do the hardest part of the trail for you, and while that may have been the case in past years, really it depends on where the butterflies roost, and when we went, people who took horses got to ride almost all the way up to the site. But next year could be different again. As an animal lover, I was happy to see that the horses appeared to be fairly well fed and cared for, had shade to rest in, and didn't seem to be struggling up the hill (although I think there should be a weight limit for tourists riding them). \nStill, I chose not to spend the 300 pesos to ride them and I'm very happy with my decision to hike myself. I'm in decent shape (going to the gym 2-3 times a week and enjoy light hiking) but live at sea level and can be pretty lazy, so I was torn about what to do. However, the hike wasn't hard at all.

In the end it was about a 45 minute hike, but I didn't find it hard at all; I never even got out of breath or broke a sweat. I think anyone in reasonable shape who has some time to adjust to altitude and takes their time will have zero problem hiking themselves. There were plenty of young children and grandparents doing the hike too, just FYI, so don't be intimidated by people saying it was super hard. I do agree with the recommendation tho to bring a mask or bandana and wear clothes you don't mind getting dusty b/c the dust was no joke. \nIn the end, I think this the best option for a day trip from Mexico City, the vast majority of visitors can probably do the hike themselves, and it's worth the trip.", "segments": ["", " Sadly the monarch migration is under threat from a number of factors, so when I realized we were in Mexico City at peak time, I knew I had to see it while I could.

I know there are also a one day organised tours from the city which make it even easier.\nFirstly there is only one official entrance with a big parking lot in front - don't stop anywhere else if you want to pay the official fees. Parking fee is \u00a310.\nWhile paying in the small ticket office $50 for the entrance ticket you will be offered to hire a horse for $200 [this is a ride up and return]. The guide fee - hiking or horse ride - are included in the ticket price so it's entirely up to you if you want to tip him at the end.\nAnd here was a dilema after reading some of the reviews on this forum. Is it worth or not to take a horse? I decide to hike/trek and was very happy with my decission, it tooks me 40 minutes to get to the point where horses are allowed, hike is easy [yes! not hard at all!] and very enjoyable, if you live in Mexico City the altitude also shouldn't be a problem. Go for it! Your boots will get a bit dusty but that is part of the adventure! To get to the meeting point by horses is aproximately 30-35 minutes.\nFrom that point all visitors have to walk with the assistance of the guide, again it is not difficult but I would say it is a bit more hard and steep than the first part I have hiked. Remember that this time you will take your time watching the Monarch Butterflies and listening the guide who will give you [in Spanish] some interesting facts about these incredible creatures  and surrounding enviroment...\nOne more thing which is important is the time of the visit. Remember not to be too early as butterflies start flying arround when is already warm and sun is up. In our case that was around 12 - 12:30pm. If you go there too early you will see only 'cocoons' of resting Monarcas.\nJust in front of the entrance you can use toilets, buy some souvenirs and snacks or vitamina T products eg. tacos :)\nEnjoy!!\n\n*all prices are from Feb 2016 and in mexican Pesos.", "segments": [" First of all the sanctuary is about 2 hrs drive from Mexico City so there is no problem whatsever to visit it during just one day.

Ixtapa is a planned community, developed in the 1970's by Fonatur, much like Cancun.  Whereas Cancun has taken off like a house on fire,  Ixtapa's growth has been slow to develop which we consider an asset as the community continues to retain the ambience of a true Mexican community.  Zihuatanejo is occupied primarily by Mexicans.  Although tourism is clearly evident, there is still very much a Mexican vibe.  Working with United Nations, this community is not simply a beach destination, it is a \u201cCulture of Peace Community\u201d, where all segments of the population are working to instill basic human values throughout. While we can't speak toward any official peace-loving status, we can certainly attest to the basic kindness and genuine interest in the wellbeing of the tourists that we have experienced on each of our visits.  Although English is not widely spoken, the desire to connect is strong; all you need to do is demonstrate a little interest.  We have learned much about the community simply by interacting with everyone and anyone.  If you would like to read more about our experiences, check out my blog post, http://hpdsinc.blogspot.ca/2013/03/how-i-spent-my-winter-vacation.html.  \nZihuatanejo International Guitar Festival http://www.zihuafest.info/:\nIf you have followed our travel experiences, you will know that, in 2012, we opted for a spontaneous trip (as in booked it Thursday and arrived Saturday 'spontaneous') to Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo.  We are music lovers and, as I cruised various websites, I stumbled upon the Zihuatanejo International Guitar Festival (ZIGF).  That first year, we caught about half of the festival and we were so impressed that we returned for the entire event in 2013.  Although we couldn't possibly see ZIGF delivering the same level of service and quality of music two years in a row, we were dead wrong.   With a combination of repeat performances and new musicians, we were just as wowed.  We love the host community, the informal venues--usually open air restaurants and beach--and the music. . . well, what is there to say except that one rarely has opportunity to experience so many world class musicians at such a ridiculously low price, in such an awesome setting.\n\nShortly after fundraising for the 2014 festival began, Eric and I made a conscious decision to sponsor ZIGF.  We are not, by any means, wealthy people; we are your average, everyday working class, middle income couple that saves up for each and every holiday.  We do, however, try to support activities within and outside of our community, that we feel has a broader benefit.  ZIGF met our criteria; it operates on a shoestring budget; relies heavily on volunteerism; and it benefits the broader community.  Not only does ZIGF have a loyal (if small) group of followers, it continues to bring new people to the lovely City of Zihuatanejo.  The Festival hosts a school concert where community children are introduced to music and the world of guitars, and interact with the musicians, as well as a public free concert for everyone to enjoy.  \nFundraising proved to be a bit more of a challenge this year; in fact, sufficient funds were raised only 23 short days prior to the Festival.  In that time, a goodly chunk of change was raised; the musicians confirmed; accommodation and venues booked; and all the little extras that must be addressed (permitting, licenses, food &amp; beverage venues, sound, seating, etc.) were attended to.  Suffice to say, for the third year in a row, we were, once again, not disappointed. To show our support, we joined a group of nine to become the Festival's inaugural 'Founders Club', entitling us to a few extra perks such as access to all venues and galas, inclusion in the Musician's Welcome Dinner and reserved front row seating at the Opening and Closing Concerts.   This year, the evening concerts were held on beautiful Playa la Madera, while galas were interspersed amongst several of the area's popular restaurants.  We also made a purchase of a guitar, handmade by fine Paracho luthier, Fernando Ganzales, and signed by all the musicians.  In Mexico, it is not unusual for skills to be passed down through multiple generations.  What makes our guitar special for us is that it is the first guitar Fernando constructed with his son.  It was a great honor for us to have them sign the guitar as well.\nAlthough the festival suffered a small shortfall, it was successful enough to draw the attention of the State, which recognized the event as an opportunity to continue attracting visitors to the community.  The dates for the 2015 Zihuatanejo International Guitar Festival have already been set to run March 6-15.  We haven't actually booked our return, let's just say, there's talk. . .  and we will continue to support this wonderful little event in any way that we can.  If I have sparked your interest in any way, shape or form, here are the questions you need to ask yourself:  are you a lover of great music of all genres?  Does the vision of being serenaded by world class musicians, on a world class beach, in a world class destination do anything for you?  Let's add the intimacy of small venues where everybody seems to know your name. If the answer is yes, to any (or all) of these questions, you owe it to yourself to check it out; we are confident you will have no regrets.  The Zihuatanejo International Guitar Festival has both a website (above) and Facebook page if you want to keep yourself abreast of its progress towards next year's event.\n\nIf I see a missed opportunity anywhere, it is for ZIGF to find a way to get the word out.  We did our best to spread the word on the our plane; but we talked to many people who were not aware that such an event was going on in the community during their visit.  This is not an easy task but I know the Festival is working hard at raising its profile.\n \n\nTouring Zihuatanejo:\nWe learned many years ago to spend as much time as possible elbow to elbow with the group leader of any guided tour.  While each guide may have a 'canned' presentation, they are a huge well of knowledge about the area which they are more than willing to share if one shows the interest and asks.  I happen to be a bit of a history buff and have a strong desire to understand the culture we are imposing upon.  No doubt, you have seen people like us on other tours.  We are the ones that run to the bus so we can get the seat right behind the driver.  When we don't have our noses flattened against the window, we are plying the driver with questions.  It's amazing what one can learn. . . but you do need to ask as your escort will be careful not to get in the way of your personal experience and we each have different needs.\n\nOn our first visit to Zihuatanejo (often referred to as Zihua), we had the immense fortune of connecting with one of the best guides we have ever been privileged to travel with.  What sets him apart from his colleagues is, he is not only passionate about his country and his community, but loves its history as well.  If he senses you have an interest, he will take the time to explain cultural innuendos and various landmarks regardless of their significance.  He is somewhat akin to a walking encyclopedia on every subject that has a local implication, from plants and wildlife to archeology and architecture, to culture and religious importance. Believe me, we have tried!   If you have been blessed with an enquiring mind or you just want to be sure you are travelling with someone who will take very good care of you, is fluent in English and truly knows what he is talking about, we highly recommend you contact Miguel Martinez at saldivar66@gmail.com.  We were so impressed that we have kept in touch, used his services on each of our visits, and are honored to regard him as our friend.  I assure you, you will not be disappointed.\n\nIn previous visits, we explored the beautiful neighbouring state of Michoac\u00e1n, well known for its abundant craftsmen.  We visited, Paracho where guitars are built; Santa Clara de Cobra (copper); Patzcuaro, which is architecturally stunning and located in a beautiful setting, the Paricutin Volcano and the nearby village of Angahuan.  An unexpected highlight of that particular trip was when Miguel wrangled us an invitation into one of the local homes  Not only did they provide us with a tour, we sampled their food, came away with a gift of tea leaves, picked and dried in the hills.  We were able to help them out by purchasing their handmade items that they would otherwise have sold in the street.  This was a very cool day for us, completely instigated by Miguel. \n\nWe will, one day, return to Michoac\u00e1n, but we thought it time we explored our host community, Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo.   Prior to the 1970s, economic activity was based on fishing and agriculture.   Today, almost 3/4 of the population is engaged in the tourism sector and, with the lag in this sector over the past few years, you can only imagine how this has affected the local economy.   Geographically, the area is mountainous and rugged; much of the developed area hugs the shoreline or is situated in the foothills of the Sierra Madre Mountains.  As we explored the local area, Miguel would often take the time to orient us, referring to a particular beach or community as being 'just over that hill'.  It became a bit of a standing joke for us that everything in the area was 'just over that hill'.  Visit, and you will get my drift.\n\n We provided Miguel a couple of ideas of what we might find interesting and then we were off.  First, we headed for the village of Barra de Potosi, on the lovely Playa Blanca, for lunch, making a quick stop at Playa Larga, a 15 km stretch of unspoiled sandy beach.  Barra de Potosi is a fishing community of about 600, located on a large lagoon, where it meets with the ocean.  You can pick up a tour of the lagoon, a large mangrove estuary teeming with wildlife; go on a fishing adventure; or, as we did, simply enjoy lunch at one of the many beachside restaurants and stroll the beach.  There is a laid-back vibe to this little village, right down to the hammocks suspended between the tables, just in case you need a little 'after dinner' siesta.  One can look across the inlet and see a restaurant located on a small jetty of land.  During the dry season, the lagoon recedes and one can walk to the restaurant but, when the water is high, access is by way of boat or a bit of a swim.  While one might think this a bit of a deterrent to patrons, we not only witnessed people swimming across but, even from a distance, one could see a good number of customers.  This beautiful beach has also attracted its share of ex-pats who, I am happy to report, have not only been well received by the local community but contribute to the community by lending support to the school and teaching English,  not to mention, frequenting the local establishments.  We would seriously consider staying here as there is a variety of accommodations and places to eat.  I would be remiss if I didn't also mention this community is also home to the highly regarded El Refugio de Potosi, a private, not-for-profit ecological conservation initiative promoting conservation, preservation, education and research.   \n\nBacktracking toward Zihuatanejo, is the community of Petatlan.  It's downtown district is built around a church located atop a hill, said to be a ruin.  Friar Juan Bautista founded the first church here in 1555, however, it was destroyed by an earthquake caused when the Paricutin volcano erupted, some 350 miles northeast, in 1943. The present church was constructed in 1949, badly damaged by another earthquake in 1985, and repaired in 1990.  It is dedicated to Padre Jes\u00fas de Petatl\u00e1n who's sculpture of the Christ, located inside the church, is considered to have produced many miracles. Petatlan is a regional pilgrimage site, particularly visited during Holy Week, by as 30,000 people.\n\nEarlier this year, I stumbled upon a blog post about a replica of the Greek Parthenon located on Playa la Ropa, Zihuatanejo and I wasn't going home without at least trying to get in to see it.  As it turns out, the guards were kind enough to allow us to wander the premises at will, provided we offer up a small token of gratitude to the caretakers.  Dubbed the Palace of Corruption, El Partenon y el Negro Durazo was a vacation home of Arturo &quot;El Negro&quot; Durazo, a Mexico City Police Chief who successfully converted his police force into a racketeering empire.   Although his salary could never have supported his habits, he acquired two palatial homes, a collection of vintage automobiles and properties in both Canada and the U.S.  Durazo amassed a fortune in illicit wealth from the bribes paid by every cop in the City, the cocaine trade, and kickbacks.  The law eventually caught up with him; he was apprehended while 'on the lamb' in Costa Rica, jailed for several years, and his properties confiscated.  Due to ill health, Durazo was granted a $3M pesos bail in 1992 and released, having completed 6 of a 16 year-sentence.  He died in 2000 at the age of 76.  Rumour has it, his ghost keeps watch outside the massive front gates.  If true, he didn't bother us and, perhaps, was thankful for the company.  If nothing else, you have to admit, it makes for one heck of a story.\nEl Partenon is truly something of an architectural if somewhat garish sensation.  With dozens of roman sculptures, and frescos, reportedly imported from Italy, this 4-bedroom 5 bath home quite literally screams bordello, right down to the mirrored ceilings of each bedroom.  Besides the front yard swimming pool, and outdoor entertainment area, there is a large cage where Durazo is reported to have kept a pet lion; what appears to be a parking structure; and staff quarters, complete with outdoor cooking area sufficient for preparing copious quantities of food.\n\nGuerrero State eventually claimed the property which was gifted, in turn, to the local university, in hopes that it could be reclaimed as a local community treasure.  We understand this acquisition is wrapped in red tape and litigation so it's unclear what the outcome will be.  Although not exactly on the official roster of 'Things to Do and See in Zihuatanejo', if you are even remotely interested in architecture and folklore, or just want to subject yourself to perhaps the most stunning views of Playa la Madera you will ever experience, it might just be a highlight of your excursion.  Personally, it's these unexpected little gems that totally make my day.\nWe continued about 30 minutes north of Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo to Troncones. Known for its many miles of unspoiled, virgin surfing beaches, Troncones is home to about 500 people.  The village includes a school, church and cemetery, in the Mexican fashion, as well as a few stores offering basic necessities.  Reportedly, until only a few decades ago, the area was completely undeveloped; one man built a home and today, the beach is lined with large vacation homes, many available for rent.  There is no public transit; cab fare is about $75 US one-way.  I suppose beauty is in the eye of the beholder but, for all I have read about this area, I admit some disappointment.  While the beach is truly beautiful, nothing but the beach represents 'real Mexico', although that's often what one reads about it.  \nHeading south, back toward Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo, we stopped at Playa Linda, home to a beachside RV park, condominiums and resort hotels. The area is frequented by locals and tourists alike and is supported by public transportation to Ixtapa Commercial.  There is also a 5+/- mile walking/bike path between Playa Linda and Ixtapa, where it is easy to connect to public transportation or cabs into Zihuatanejo.  Patio chairs, tables and beach umbrellas are available for rent at la Langosta Loca, which also provides free showers to its beach customers.  Playa Linda is also where you can catch a boat to Ixtapa Island which, we have been told by many, is an absolute 'must see'.  The Habitat Natural de Cocodrilos provides viewing platforms where you can observe crocodiles, iguana, turtles, and several species of birds, including pink spoonbills.  For the most part, the sanctuary is fenced off from the public but make no mistake, away from the public eye, these critters are free to roam.  Though we have yet to see a crocodile in the wild, there are many signs warning of their presence, particularly in the vicinity of golf courses.  That would certainly make searching for lost balls a challenge, wouldn't it!\nOur excursion with Miguel was approximately 8 hours long and we loved every minute of it but you can make it what you want.  His vehicle is an 8 passenger SUV so there opportunity to share the expenses with others; we just enjoy hoarding him ha! ha!\nI truly hope you have found the information I've provided useful or, at the very least, entertaining and informative.  I'm a huge supporter of information sharing.  I like to read about the travels of others, in hopes of learning something new and discovering a new destination, if only in my imagination.

You can pick up a tour of the lagoon, a large mangrove estuary teeming with wildlife; go on a fishing adventure; or, as we did, simply enjoy lunch at one of the many beachside restaurants and stroll the beach. There is a laid-back vibe to this little village, right down to the hammocks suspended between the tables, just in case you need a little 'after dinner' siesta. This beautiful beach has also attracted its share of ex-pats who, I am happy to report, have not only been well received by the local community but contribute to the community by lending support to the school and teaching English,  not to mention, frequenting the local establishments. It is dedicated to Padre Jes\u00fas de Petatl\u00e1n who's sculpture of the Christ, located inside the church, is considered to have produced many miracles. Earlier this year, I stumbled upon a blog post about a replica of the Greek Parthenon located on Playa la Ropa, Zihuatanejo and I wasn't going home without at least trying to get in to see it. Dubbed the Palace of Corruption, El Partenon y el Negro Durazo was a vacation home of Arturo &quot;El Negro&quot; Durazo, a Mexico City Police Chief who successfully converted his police force into a racketeering empire. Although his salary could never have supported his habits, he acquired two palatial homes, a collection of vintage automobiles and properties in both Canada and the U.S.  Durazo amassed a fortune in illicit wealth from the bribes paid by every cop in the City, the cocaine trade, and kickbacks. The law eventually caught up with him; he was apprehended while 'on the lamb' in Costa Rica, jailed for several years, and his properties confiscated. With dozens of roman sculptures, and frescos, reportedly imported from Italy, this 4-bedroom 5 bath home quite literally screams bordello, right down to the mirrored ceilings of each bedroom. Guerrero State eventually claimed the property which was gifted, in turn, to the local university, in hopes that it could be reclaimed as a local community treasure. Although not exactly on the official roster of 'Things to Do and See in Zihuatanejo', if you are even remotely interested in architecture and folklore, or just want to subject yourself to perhaps the most stunning views of Playa la Madera you will ever experience, it might just be a highlight of your excursion. Personally, it's these unexpected little gems that totally make my day. Reportedly, until only a few decades ago, the area was completely undeveloped; one man built a home and today, the beach is lined with large vacation homes, many available for rent. I suppose beauty is in the eye of the beholder but, for all I have read about this area, I admit some disappointment. While the beach is truly beautiful, nothing but the beach represents 'real Mexico', although that's often what one reads about it. The Habitat Natural de Cocodrilos provides viewing platforms where you can observe crocodiles, iguana, turtles, and several species of birds, including pink spoonbills. Though we have yet to see a crocodile in the wild, there are many signs warning of their presence, particularly in the vicinity of golf courses.

I appreciate it even more now that I have two young children as it is easy to get to, the kids have a good time and I can relax.  \n\nThe beach is amazing. Low waves, no major undercurrent, sand is soft and fine and the water is warm.  You can't go wrong with this place. .. \n\nWee get thee at 9 amish, which is a great time to get great seats.  We usually stay until 4 pm.\n\nHere's the scoop on how to make it a great day.\n\n1. What to take...especially if you have little ones.\n- Bring your own towels, a water spray bottle, change of clothes, snacks and water.  A tip - get a ziplock back and put in a wet wash cloth with some extra water in it.  You will find this handy to wipe your face/of the kids after a swim in the water or when they get sand in their eyes.  Few locations have showers and even if they do, there is limited water, so you can't count on water.  This when a wet towel and a water spray bottle come in handy.\n\n2. Getting there and to where?\n\nMy favorite spot is La Perla restaurant. All the cab drivers know where it it is.  If you are coming from ixtapa it is a 15 minutes can ride and as of Nov 2014 the cost was 140 pesos.  They will drop you off at the restaurant.  Take the cabbie's cell phone number, but there is no need for the dab to wait for you.  There are always cans in the parking lot or you can call the same cabbie later if you need to.  You can always ask the folks at La Perla to call on your behalf.\n\n3. La Perla \nIt is a restaurant on the beach front. It is clean, great bathrooms (although very poor water pressure in the sinks). The food is fantastic,  and there are plenty of seating areas.  If you want beach chairs, it will cost 50 pesos for a table, and two beach chairs (reclining/upright). These are available by an independent vendor, but they are out in front of La Perla. One other benefit if you are traveling with kids is that they are willing to store milk, snack and any other refrigerated items for the kids.  I always bring a few milk boxes and fruit, and just keep them in their fridge. The kids always nap right on the beach so I can give them their milk after lunch and they are set.\n\nMy favorite dishes there are the huevos rancheros for breakfast! and for lunch I always get the huachinango al mojo de ajo (red snapper in a garlic rub that is grilled). Their fish is fresh and brought in daily by the local fishermen. They have other fish which are also very good, but the kids an d I are partial to the snapper.  Also, there are other ways they will prepare your snapper - in a chilli sauce, with tomatoes and chillies, etc.  The other options are sometimes a bit over powering, so I stick to the garlic/butter treatment.  For snacking we always do guacamole and the fresh coconuts. Prices are pretty good.  Fish is about 200 pesos (the fish can be shared.  It is very large)v guacamole is about 80 pesos and the drinks are pretty standard price.\n\n4. Music man\nYou will see plenty of men with guitars walking around.  Have them okay some wonderful songs for you.  If you are visiting, request these..\nCielito Lindo, Mexico Lindo y Querido, De Colores and La Bamba.  They charge $100 pesos for three or four songs.  You'll love the serenade and it helps the local economy of independent workers.\n\n5. Other activities:\nThere are many vendors who walk the area - someone who does braids, someone who sells hand woven bags, others who sell hammocks, shell and bead jewelry, etc.  I always get something ... Gifts for friends  and family, and items for myself. The handicraft market in Zihuatanejo has very similar prices and you will want to head there for more deliberate and serious handicraft, clothing, traditional craft shopping. The vendors at La Ropa have some nice things and again, even buying something as small as a 20 peso. Bead bracelet or a. $150 pesos for a hand woven basket goes a very long ways for these local vendors. \n\n6. Massages -\nRight next to La Perla are two open air, but tented massage spots.  It's hot and feel pretty sticky, but they do a good job.  I always get one. Can't tell you how great they are as I usually fall asleep.  Or hour is $200 pesos (about $18 US dollars). One treat for your toddler...I always ask to shorten my massage by 15 minutes and massage my little girl for 15 min. She loves it and gets so relaxed that she falls asleep just in time for nap time. And for nap time, I just set some towels under the coconut trees for shade and the kiddos are out for 2 hours.\n\n7. The bad?\nThe only complaint I have is no showers, but we've gotten around this. I usually ask for a plastic cup I can fill with water at the sink or use an empty water bottle that I would have ordered at the restaurant and fill with water (again really low pressure to even wash hands well at the sink). I'll step off to the side in the parking lot and use that water to rinse the kids' faces/body if they get too prickly etc. It takes a couple of refills, but we make it work. If they had showers (and mainly because of the kids) I would give La Ropa 5 stars.\n", "segments": ["", " They have other fish which are also very good, but the kids an d I are partial to the snapper.

We had 3 of our kids with, ages 9, 11, and 17. Just ask to make sure the bus is going to Playa Linda, there should be a sign in bus window. The bus driver took US money. Once arriving at Playa Linda we got off the bus and stopped at the crocodile sanctuary right on the side walk off the bus stop. Then, we turned left down a path to the marina, about a 5 minute walk, through a sandy parking lot. At the marina, we paid $3 per  person ($15) roundtrip to the island. Again, we paid in US without any problems. Save your ticket for the return trip, they will ask for it on the way back. They will also remind you to tip on the return trip. We got dropped off at the swimming beach, calmer than the snorkeling side. We were asked to stop at the restaurants on the swimming beach but I will say not hassled, just asked once then left alone. About, 1/4 ways down the beach a gentleman asked us what we were there for and I said snorkeling, he said to follow him to the other side to check it out for snorkeling. He said I could just look, to trust him. So, we walked to the other side, about a 1 minute walk. We were at the Lili Cipraini restaurant which is actually on both sides. This was a great decision! Gustavo was our waiter and we got a table with an umbrella right on the beach. We didn't order food but got 5 bottled waters, 1 soda and 1 famous pineapple drink in the pineapple. It was 305 pesos. We actually paid this bill in pesos. We could have sat there all day. Then, we paid $63 in US for a snorkeling guide for all 5 of us (Luis was awesome) and equipment. It was our kids first time snorkeling and having a guide was perfect and stress free! Luis brought up a blow fish, a sea urchin and a spider star fish for all us to touch! He also took pictures which I bought after for $20. Jimmy, a worker, emailed the pictures to me that night, no problems! We tipped Gustavo and Luis on our own. They were awesome! There are also flush toilets and running water in the bathrooms at this restaurant. We probably got to the island around 11 and left at 2.

Water shoes would work well. We didn't have any and did ok but don't expect soft sand! There are cactus on the island and it is neat to see them next to palm trees. There are all of these restaurants on the island right on the beach and if you buy a drink or food you can sit at the table for the day while you enjoy the beach. We had valuables with us (money, phones) and Gustavo said we could put that up by Jimmy to keep safe while we snorkeled and so we did. It was kept safe and absolutely no problems!

My recommendation is not to book an excursion at your resort because it is just way too easy to get there on your own.  \n\nWe stayed at Club Med Ixtapa.  A bus ride to Playa Linda is the way to go from wherever you might be in Ixtapa, forget the taxi.  It was only 8 pesos one way by bus from Club Med or about a 15 minute walk.

Once you land at the island, walk straight in front of you to the other side of the island, about a 30 second walk, to Playa Coral.  The other beaches are primarily for swimming, but not much shade anywhere if you aren't under a palapa or if you don't have your own umbrella.\n\nWe brought our own snorkelling gear because I can't speak to the disinfection techniques of the snorkel equipment by the mom and pop operations/restaurants on the island.  Infectious diseases could be passed along easily, and it wasn't a risk I wanted to take.  A mask and snorkel is really all thats necessary if you don't have fins, and they do sell them at playa Linda.  You just need to be able to look into the water when swimming around the island.\n\nIts best to get to the island early in the morning, when the waters are the clearest as too many people can really kick up the sand.  Upon arriving at the island you may be approached by local businesses offering you drinks, food and a palapa.  You will definitely need a shady palapa as there are no trees to shade you on the beach of Playa Coral, and it really heats up there unless you are in the water.  \n\nWe stayed at the Princess Rebeca location on the beach.

The people around us did so and received what appeared to be an edible pina colada pineapple arrangement for 150 pesos a piece.  I'm sure they tasted great--they looked great too.\n\nSome caveats when visiting the island.  The beach is very thick and  sandy as the hunks of coral have broken down over time.  In fact, the coral on the beach in places can be sharp and uncomfortable.  The sand as you approach the water is so porous that your feet will sink in...it is not the dense hard water packed sand you normally find on the other beaches.  There is no gradual descent into the water...so be careful if you are there with kids and keep them within arms reach.  In fact, kids should have a life jacket on unless they are older than 11 or 12 and are strong swimmers.  The waves here can easily knock you off balance if you aren't watching, especially as you navigate amongst the coral.  I would not visit this island if there are lots of big waves on the sea that day as it could ruin your ability to get into the water easily or see anything from stirring up the sand. The shoreline is variable when it comes to water depth, so in places you can stand easily and others it drops off. Its very important to stay in the middle and avoid the rocks which are on either end of the beach.   But when you start snorkelling, the noise of the beach disappears and you are in a wonderful underwater world.  The island doesn't have a huge variety of fish compared to the Caribbean, but nonetheless it is so peaceful underwater and enjoyable to have fish swimming alongside you.  We didn't see the puffer fish but they do exist here.  We did see a sea urchin, a sea snake and various other fish. \n\nA couple of hours here is really all that is needed unless you want to stick around and eat.  We opted to head back to the resort for a late lunch as we were there with our 3 kids aged 11, 13 and 16 and they aren't fish lovers.  However, I've read that the fish is really great at the restaurants on the island, so worth a try.

The snorkel site is the same no matter how much you pay. \n\nThe expensive way is to take an organized excursion from your hotel, for perhaps $80 US per person. We did the cheap way, and you can too. Here\u2019s how.\n\nWe took a taxi from our hotel in Ixtapa to Playa Linda. Cost 130 pesos for the four of us, plus a 20 peso tip.  \n\nAt Playa Linda you walk through an area with lots of stalls selling things like T shirts and beach stuff. Keep walking along until you get to the end of a pier (it\u2019s to your left). It\u2019s about a 5 minute walk. If you\u2019re not sure where to go, a friendly Mexican will be delighted to show you the way, no doubt hoping for a tip. (Today you will have all that popularity you dreamed about in high school.) We found our own way with no difficulty. \nAt the end of the pier you pay 50 pesos per person for the round trip ferry boat to the island. Save the receipt for the return journey. The boat ride lasts about 10 minutes, and the boats run all the time. I really mean all the time. As soon as one boat is pulling out, another one is pulling in, or there may even be more than one there at the time. They are cute little 12-passenger boats. Tipping the boat driver and the man who helps you off the boat is optional. \n\nOnce you get off the boat, you walk straight up the beach away from the water and across the island. This takes at most 2 minutes; the island is really narrow at this point. Don\u2019t worry, you can\u2019t go the wrong way. Directly across the island from where you got off the boat is Playa Coral, where the snorkelling is. \n\nNow you need to choose a restaurant. Or it will choose you. All along the beach are restaurants with tables and chairs, and sun loungers. If you want to order food, the table and sun loungers will be free for as long as you want them. If you don\u2019t want to order anything, or just want drinks, ask the price of the table. (At the first restaurant they wanted 200 pesos for the table if we didn\u2019t order anything. This seems quite fair; after all, these people do need to make a living.) We walked along the beach to the far end and sat at the last restaurant there. We just wanted drinks and to rent one lifejacket, and were told there would be no charge for the table. \n\nWe were given menus, and the prices were really reasonable.

Playa Coral is in a bay with few waves. The water is really clear once you get away from the sandy area at the shore, and the fish and coral are beautiful. There are tons of different types of fish. You will love it! You will see other people following roughly the best path. Stay in water deep enough that you won\u2019t accidentally scrape the coral with your fins, and you won\u2019t scrape your body either; coral can be sharp. \n\nIf you get there early in the morning before the tourist groups arrive you will have the place mostly to yourself, but it was fun even after they got there. \n\nThere are no fresh water showers on the island, though there are some at Playa Linda. \n\nThe cost for our day \u2013 2 taxi rides 300 pesos (with tips), 4 ferry fares 200 pesos total, restaurant bill for 3 drinks, 1 lifejacket rental, and tip - 180 pesos. 680 pesos altogether for a trip for four people.

If you book a tour from the hotel make sure everything is spelled out i.e. does the price you pay include snorkeling gear, lunch etc. Get it in writing on the receipt and verify the receipt actually has the amount you have paid for the tour and not a reduced rate. You can also do it cheaper by taking a taxi from the hotel and paying the 40 pesos for the boat ticket to cross over to the island. You can rent your snorkeling gear from the island for around 350-500 pesos. You can also bring your own snorkeling gear which I highly recommend. You really do not require life vests unless you are not a swimmer.\nThe travel time from the hotel zone in Ixtapa to Isla Ixtapa is about 25 -30 minutes. Once you arrive you walk on to the pier about a 10 minute walk from where you got off your vehicle to take the boat ride to the island. Boats arrive one after the other, so the wait time is not too long. I recommend wearing a hat as there is no shade on the Pier. Boat swains and others around help you get in and get off the boat so it should not be a huge concern. The boat ride is not a bumpy ride as I have experienced with other snorkeling destinations. It's about a 10 minute boat ride to the island. Be prepared to see lots of Pelicans diving in for fish or waiting around the Pier. Once you get on to the island, the side you get off is the swimming beach. You walk 5-10 minutes across the island to the other side which is the snorkeling beach. Both sides of have restaurants. When we went the restaurants and the beaches were packed as it was a holiday week for Mexican nationals. \nOur tour included a lunch which was very basic, and was not very good. The wait staff bring around a fresh off the boat fish platter and ask you if you want to pay extra for Red Snapper, Lobster, large Prawns etc. I recommend you bring lots of pesos to order extra sea food and drinks. \nIf you plan on spending a whole day on Isla Ixtapa or even just half a day, I highly recommend getting a massage here. I did, and it was worth every peso I paid for it. I only had time for a half hour massage which cost me 300 pesos which roughly translates to about US$18.00. One of our group members had a three hour massage!!!\nWe had a guide take us snorkeling. I would say that the snorkeling itself is average. We saw many colorful fish as well as a bright orange puffer fish, and it is great fun for youngsters. After snorkeling we went over to the other side of the island to swim.
