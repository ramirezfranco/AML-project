Those with these expectations will never truly appreciate what they see in life. Teopanzolco provides a rich history of the Morelos Valley in which Cuernavaca sits. It was settled from about 2000 BC and there is evidence to believe that there was an earlier occupation in the great square of Teopanzolco. During the Classic Period, Teopanzolco came under the influence of the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. By the Postclassic Period, various Nahua groups had moved in the Altiplano; the Tlahuicas Indians founded the city of Cuauhnahuac (the pre-Spanish name for Cuernavaca) pronounced Kwaa-nah-wok sometime around 1200 AD when they first settled here. They built the Teopanzolco Pyramids before being conquered by the Aztec emperor Moctezuma Ilhuicamina in 1427 AD. The once-peaceful Tlahuicas were integrated into the Aztec Empire and forced to pay tribute in large amounts of cotton clothing and blankets and to participate in the Aztec military campaigns. In 1521, with the arrival of the Spaniards, the prehispanic history of Teopanzolco was brought to a close. It is believed that Teopanzolco was the original Ceremonial Center of the city of Cuauhnahuac during the Early Aztec period (AD 1150–1350) before the center was moved to a more defensible location, now the center of the modern city of Cuernavaca. There are 15 structures within the park that were built between 1300 and 1521 and are of the Late Postclassic Period. The Ceremonial Center was dedicated (as was the Templo Mayor in Mexico City) to Huitzilopochtli (The God of the Sun, representing war and sacrifice) and Tlaloc (The God of Rain representing fertility and growth). On the north end was the Temple of Tlaloc and on the south was the Temple of Huitzilopochtli. The bases of the two temples are still intact. Tezcatlipoca, Ehecatl, among other Gods were worshiped at Teopanzolco. When the Spaniards arrived in Cuauhnāhuac (renamed Cuernavaca by the Spaniards) and destroyed all symbols related to the past deities, the construction within the Ceremonial Center was stopped and the Ceremonial Center was covered over with dirt. What you see is the Ceremonial Center of Teopanzolco, which is only a small part of the prehispanic City of Cuauhnāhuac, as most of the residential areas lie beneath the surrounding development. When the Spaniards arrived in Cuauhnāhuac (renamed Cuernavaca by the Spaniards) and destroyed all symbols related to the past deities, the construction within the Ceremonial Center was stopped and the Ceremonial Center was covered over with dirt. The Ceremonial Center lay hidden until 1910, when during the Mexican Revolution, Emiliano Zapata's revolutionary forces installed cannons on top of the mound of dirt covering the Great Platform.
